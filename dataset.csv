Yepp! ... SETI can't hear any aliens ... because ... they are NOT doing it correctly !! Same as in 1920s people will just not 'hear' of any ... encrypted-compressed-digital-radio-communications of today. /* we still have so much to learn */ -VJO
We're all thinking ""that's a good band name,"" and sure enough: ""Atomic Radio is Metro Detroit's premier cover band. Atomic Radio features members hailing from the area's top local bands, coming together to form the ultimate super group. Atomic Radio performs the latest Chart Smashing hits of today and yesterday's Pop, Rock, and Hip Hop.""
I wonder how good these atomic antennae would be of use to SETI in discovering alien communication?
The first part of that seems to be more about how it works, which isn't an answer to my question. It's not clear what benefits the remaining two things would bring (digital signals are already a bit more resistant to interference as it is, compared to analog signals). I guess a wider range is probably useful though (I assume that translates to more bandwidth, not an expert though, maybe I'm misunderstanding what's meant here).
It's too bad they didn't use two atoms of Gallium. Then they could have recorded ""Radio GaGa"". I'll show myself out. Edit: Partially ninja'd by lex_lurker. Actually, here's what they should have recorded.
Nitpick, that’s multitrack rather than stereo, surely?
If you leave your atomic radio in the car long enough does it only play Queen thereafter?
What have you done with Chris Lee?!
Atomic Radio! Atomic Radio! Non radiactive Atomic Radio! Ehem, this is cool and all but at this rate the tech won't be available for consumer use for a few decades.
Ha! Now that would very nicely explain why SETI has turned up empty handed so far : RF is so low tech! No decent civilization in this galaxy would be crazy enough to communicate through THAT for any amount of time.
do we have any idea on range, or is it still way way too early for that? I wounder how manny decades it will be before we hear about trans Atlantic tests.
It plays everything... Until you observe it. Then you hear only one thing.
Oh that's no problem for selling to audiophiles. You just need to convince one gullible sneering bunch that Cesium 133 has a much more organic (har), softer, more vibrant sound than Rubidium 85, or pick the atom of your choice - who cares what the plebs are listening to when you have the richness of Au 197? Or the cancer curing waveforms of Radium 226.
Listening to the recording made me think about the hiss. Unlike in wired recording, this isn’t just stray induced noise from other components it’s the actual background noise from the universe! (at least as modified by human sources).
No, none of those. This is a cool science trick with a contrived application for which there are a century of more practical and all around better solutions. Ask yourself: does it fit in my pocket? If not, it's not a practical implementation of a radio receiver because we've been able to buy radio receivers that fit in your pocket since the 1954.
The photo caption is incorrect. That's Christopher L. Holloway, not ""C. J. Holloway."" And by the way, I used to know that guy. Interesting work, Chris!

I don't think it analog vs digital comes into play. Regardless of receiver type digital allows you to do things like send error correction information along with the representation of the source information to improve performance in the presence of noise or interference. This article has more to do with the circuits that would feed either an analog or digital detector. Right now receivers are fundamentally limited by the thermal energy that creates excitation of electrons even when a signal is not present. The excitation from the received signal must be greater than the thermal noise to recover the information. The paper seems to indicate the that configuration of electrons in these atomic receivers performs better than traditional semiconductors from a signal to noise perspective. Either the thermal noise is reduced or a larger signal is generated given the same field strength (higher gain). The receiver in the paper didn't look particularly good. I'm assuming there are some physicists who have figured out the theoretical performance limitations of these receivers. I'm not smart enough to understand the mathematics. It doesn't really cover how they would make more advanced receivers for complex phase/amplitude modulated signals. Also it isn't clear how it responds to waves launched with different polarizations. This (along with frequency) drives an antenna's size and physical structure. You'd have to have some metric to compare a cube of this material to an antenna structure designed for vertical or circular polarized reception.
Tune an AM radio to the white noise between stations, and you'll also be listening to the background noise from the universe.
I wonder if this could be paired with quantum entanglement for ""faster than light"" communications.

I guess a wider range is probably useful though (I assume that translates to more bandwidth, not an expert though, maybe I'm misunderstanding what's meant here). Digital or Analog is a means of encoding information within a signal. The signal itself doesn't decide whether the information you stuff into it is analog or digital, that's up to your implementation of a transmitter and receiver. Error correction within a digital encoded signal does help alleviate some of the problems caused by interference but it doesn't remove the effect entirely. Eventually you hit a point where the errors accumulate too much to effectively clean up the signal, you can see this very clearly on a digital TV tuner, it's the point where it just gives up and the channel cuts out entirely. I forget what the terminology is for it but it's essentially effective bandwidth of the signal. The less interference you have to deal with the more effective bandwidth you have to use for data, be it analog or digital.
Ok, it recorded Queen. But what about lesser bands?
I'm sure the intelligence world is following the subject very closely.
No, because quantum entanglement can't be used to send information faster than light. That isn't just an experimental finding, there are fundamental mathematical reasons why you can't use entanglement to do that.
I could be wrong, but I would guess the scheme is still subject to roughly the same fundamental limitations of shot noise (establishing the noise floor), as this still seems a Poisson type process.
Surely you mean Atomic, by Blondie?
That's also true of FM receivers. Or an old analog television allows you to SEE the background noise from the universe. Or maybe you just see the thermal noise generated in the front end of your receiver. That's more likely unless you have a very low-noise receiver. (or tuned to a band where the universe emits a lot of noise).
The first album they should record is ""Atom Heart Mother.""
Baby boomers old enough to recall the days when TV stations went off the air at night are familiar with the video and audio static that remained after sign-off (at least for stations that didn't continue to broadcast an Indian Head test pattern all night). I've read that this static signal is mostly attributable to cosmic microwave background radiation...although you couldn't prove it by me. I hope that's correct, but either way it's a nice story.

Good on them; I hope that refinements to this method continue. Useful for future space sensors and communications! And if I may, the true test of the atomic system's music recording ability should be Beethoven's symphony #9-- specifically, ""Ode to Joy"". Gotta respect the classics!
It never ceases to amaze me how life has evolved to fit the environment, how far it has come, and how much we have to lose.
Its always good to see different disciplines of science coming together to provide insight and solutions to hypotheses.
I find it hard to imagine that there isn't alien life out there. Not necessarily intelligent, but I think our definition of life is much too strict. Other planets with far different conditions could create some sort of life that we may not even recognized as life. To your other point, if humans screw everything up, in a 100 million years, life will continue on and we will just be a footnote. -d
Kind of reminds me of cnidarans before, what I would like to think of them as, they differentiated between medusa and polyp forms (Ghu, has it really been 35 years since classes in marine biology?); hope I didn't mangle the terms too much...
Yeah that's true enough, we'll probably not mess it up so bad that life can't recover over millions of years. But it'd be nice for our legacy not to be one of mass extinction.

Darwinian fitness is defined by the number of viable offspring an organism can produce. It has nothing to do with ""fitness"" the way we normally use it, or the way you're using it here.
Life, uh, finds a way.
It's not too wildly improbable that Ernietta might have been able to reproduce asexually (basically, cloning itself - usually accomplished by budding, as observed nowadays in Hydra). In which case commensalism would make even more sense, Darwin-wise. If you and I are clones of each other, then anything I do that benefits you and improves your reproductive fitness is the same as reproducing myself. Cooperation FTW! Last edited by LesDawg on Fri Jun 21, 2019 2:01 pm
At least until that one clone gets jealous and starts insisting it's the original
We are already causing mass extinction.
The irony here is that this was so early in the evolutionary record, there were probably ecological niches without any competition at all, and these critters filled the niche. Without any competition to begin with, cooperative adaptation may have worked better to get ahead than a Darwinist amoeba eat amoeba scenario. From the sound of it, they had nothing going for them for ""defense"". They likely didn't have a need to evolve one. Without a need for defense, ""survival of the fittest"" probably hadn't started yet - at least not against other organisms. But I'm not sure ""cooperative behavior"" is really an appropriate use of the phrase, since it implies active involvement. It may well be that the physics determined where the critters could grow in the first place, because any establishing itself elsewhere failed to thrive outside of the convections created by the current. There was probably a ratio that had to do with size, making them bundle closer, but as they grew, the only way to survive was to establish at an advantageous location. Without seeing the intermediate stages of this patter, it's hard to say how it evolved. But I'd hazard a guess that the physics had a hell of a lot more to do with where these things ended up at a given size than any amount of actual ""cooperation"" in the sense of active participation in the process. It sounds more like happenstance based on the environment, than it does actual cooperative behavior.
Cooperative behaviour just means they are fitter than others without cooperative behaviour. Screwing others were never in any definition of fittest. (Mental illnesses are seldom a form of fitness)
Nobody in his right might (and the knowledge of certain facts) doubts that there is life out there in the – unbelievably vast - universe(s). The problem is that we can’t even leave our solar system “in time”. The nearest stars are so far away that a trip to them would make our evolution seem like the blink of an eye. ;-)
It doesn't even mean that. It just means that the replacement ratio > 1, i.e. the number of offspring surviving to breed successfully must at least equal the number of parents. The number of viable offspring is only important if it falls below that ratio. Ducks may produce 12 ducklings, an albatross lays only one egg every couple of years, but the ducklings get eaten till only a couple are left on average, whereas if we stop harming albatrosses one egg every couple of years will eventually increase the population.
While there is likely no relation to bilaterial animals, drawn like that Ernietta segmentation looks a lot like a folded up Dickinsonia. Speaking of which: Quote: few organisms even had the ability to move about [in the Ediacaran] This is just out as well, Dickinsonia for sure (p < 0.001) and many of its relatives (say, Spriggina seems to have been moving about for feeding [ https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2 ... 100023.htm ]. It looks like that sorts out the anterior end - most scientists had it correct - and the ""footprints"" as bacterial mat feeding imprints. Dickinsonia moved on average 1.1 body lengths for good measure, then sat down and feed through the lower area - my guess would be cilia for both functions. Despite being an independent lineage of Bilateria - it developed by adding bilateral glide-and- mirror symmetry instead of mirror symmetry segments - it and its related morphs suggest for the authors of the published paper that the common bilateral ancestor was mobile. They discuss that the soft body preservation difficulties may meant that a lot of moving species were about in the Ediacaran, but of course YMMV. greevar wrote: But, survival of the fittest! That means screwing others over to get ahead! Oh? It's not? Cooperative behavior is more beneficial than self-interest? Well, shit... But ""survival of the fittest"" is an outdated term that today is mainly used by trolls of biology. As Reaperman2 notes, it is differential reproduction that can be the result of selection or other biological mechanisms, and inclusive fitness has been a known result for the better part of a century [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness ]: ""If a gene (or gene complex) promoting altruistic behavior has copies of itself in others, helping those others survive ensures that the genes will be passed on. Hamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population ... "". Selfish genes implies cooperative behavior will evolve in wide circumstances. Even bacteria like Myxobacteria are known to display such traits: ""Myxobacteria can move by gliding.[6] They typically travel in swarms (also known as wolf packs), containing many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. Individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of the extracellular enzymes that are used to digest food; this in turn increases feeding efficiency. ... When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into fruiting bodies (not to be confused with those in fungi), a process long-thought to be mediated by chemotaxis but now considered to be a function of a form of contact-mediated signaling.[8][9] These fruiting bodies can take different shapes and colors, depending on the species. Within the fruiting bodies, cells begin as rod-shaped vegetative cells, and develop into rounded myxospores with thick cell walls. These myxospores, analogous to spores in other organisms, are more likely to survive until nutrients are more plentiful. The fruiting process is thought to benefit myxobacteria by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, rather than as isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among certain amoebae, called cellular slime molds."" [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxobacteria ] Bacterial wolf packs and transient complex multicellulars, bilateral body plan complex organisms ... all a result of selfish genes.
hmmm, now how can these humans make use of this? might take us a few more generations of 'adapting' before we get the hang of it.... time is short, better get someone to study this for a contingency plan while the planet reverts to one of these 'snowballs'....
Quote: This is where the fluid mechanics were brought in. Quote: But the fluid mechanics weren't done yet. I just have to point out that using the phrase ""fluid mechanics"" as plural, especially in these particular sentences, makes me imagine guys in coveralls using wrenches to fix fluids. I've always thought of it as singular. I use the word mathematics the same way. Is that a regional thing?
""fluid mechanics"" is the field of study. As a field it is singular ""the fluid mechanics"" is the group of mechanics who work with fluids. As a group of mechanics it is plural tacking ""the"" onto the front end changes the meaning drastically.
Haha, that's a good follow-up to my jo— oh, wait a sec, you sound serious. Um... are you saying that mathematicians and engineers who are experts in the Navier-Stokes equations call themselves mechanics?

A chiropractor misleading people for their own financial gain? Perish the thought!
So they're not real as described, not bad as they actually exist, not increasing in frequency, studied by a non-impartial researcher, counted in a non-random sample population, and not correlated to phone use. Other than those minor caveats, it sounds like this was a great study.
Saw the subtitle and immediately said ""Must be a Beth Mole article."" Was not disappointed.
Too bad. Based on that headline alone I was hoping the original article was claiming that smartphone use was causing actual, rams' horns to sprout on people's heads. Followed up with claims of sightings of people clashing heads for dominance for the best spot for wifi coverage, and those with the largest horn curls walking into shops to claim the newest, sleekest phones with the largest screens. Way to burst my bubble with actual reporting with actual facts.
I thought you had to work on Wall Street to suffer that affliction.
How that 'result' got past multiple people during the supposed peer-review and then past more people to be reported without at any point triggering a huge amount of scepticism is astounding.
When I first saw this I thought — wait a second, why would phones cause this anymore than any other activity that causes us to look downwards (if in fact, looking downward causes it at all). I'm a tall guy, I always look downward as I'm sure short folk tend to always look up. When I read, I'm looking downward too. How is reading any different than using my phone? And then I saw the data sets and I was like, how are they even really determining there being much of a shift at all? So to sum it up... (1) How in the heck are they justifying saying that there's a real increase in the incidence (do we have historical records that are age distributed to see if the more-in-young less-in-old was also the case back in the day?)? (2) How in the heck are they justifying saying that it's mobile devices and not the myriad other things that cause us to look downward? It doesn't look like they controlled for looking down on short people (sorry!) or bibliophiles (or probably a lot of other groups)
You can't fool us, you DEVIL WORSHIPPERS. You want us to continue using smartphones until we grow horns as part of the DEMON ARMY and create HELL ON EARTH!
Why do we keep acting like chiropractors are anything more than snake oil salesmen? They aren't legitimate medical professionals, and nobody should pay any attention to anything they say.
I can say without a doubt, my child would glue multiple phones to his head if horns could be made to grow by such things. Can't say I'd blame him. Edit: Also, jebus, people are stupid.
Maybe the spurs come from the amount of time we spend facepalming after seeing yet another poorly researched, sensationalized mainstream news story? That's my hypothesis.
Astounding, and yet hardly surprising. The study opportunity here is in how such trash gets believed and propogated, and how so many so called 'science' reporters don't have the faintest ability to see glaring flaws or apply the slightest bit of skepticism.

What about people that do tedious assembly work in any factory? They are looking down constantly. Mankind has always looked down not just now that smartphones are ubiquitous. Also what was the physical shape of these people? You usually don''t go to a chiropractor unless you have body issues/pain. Just another quack imho.

Not surprising to see Ars attempt to debunk this groundbreaking research, since everyone knows they are deep in the pocket of Big Horn.

This is the problem with modern news media. They publish a story on a charlaton that every one can instantly know to be a lie as the truth. while I dislike the term fake news, that is what this is. Fake and false news. Gossip news, it is why I come to ars to avoid being rammed into such lies.
Hey. It's bone spurs. So the cell phones are going to turn us all into clones of Donald Trump! Isn't that bad enough?

Fake news at its best...

Some, yes. But sports ""chiropractors"" are legitimate as they are just experts in muscle/skeleton anatomy and how injuries heal. I was skeptical because they all tend to get lumped in together, but seeing one for physical therapy actually helped resolve a long standing back injury I had. The key difference being the use of exercise and stretching, and not magical bone cracking.
Seeking a doctorate... in European History.
While I don't disagree that most chiropractors believe in all sorts of quack, they do have legitimate purposes as well. I went through a period in which inflamation of the cartilage that holds ribs in place led to a couple of occurrences of my dislocating a rib. There's a reason that can easily be confused for a heart attack; it's excruciating and you cannot inhale most of the way leading to shortness of breath. Resetting dislocated ribs on short notice is one very useful thing that chiropractors do.
While some are indeed questionable, many can and do help with spinal issues.
Anything to get click media.
Well if you believe Borat, Jewish people naturally have horns. And since we own all the things, this must be a big conspiracy to convert all of the honest, Christ-loving Christians and devout, Muhammad-loving Muslims to Judaism.

Why? Are you referring to the two failed recovery attempts of the core booster? Otherwise, the falcon heavy has performed flawlessly on its two large noches as far as I know.
This one seems really bizarre to me. How often does a train a lorry or a ship disclose it's payload to the areas it's passing?
Vulcan (the rocket holding company). Not to be confused with Vulcan (the in-development rocket) or Vulcain (the in-develoment rocket engine). Did I miss any?
Probably most of the time if it’s passing national borders. Most certainly if it contains a restricted substance/part.
it's a New Zealand publication asking about something in New Zealand. And I doubt they ask the Russians, Chinese or Americans what they're launching. I guess it'll be turned down quick snap or it risks setting a ridiculous precedent.
The payload does need to be approved by the New Zealand government - both from a legal perspective (it's a requirement of the act of parliament allowing space launches) & from an import perspective. There are some types of payloads that are illegal under NZ law. It doesn't necessarily need to be disclosed publicly, however NZ is generally a pretty open society and has a government Freedom of Information-type act (Official Information Act) & this prompted some curiosity, hence the request. I believe the expectation is that confidentiality will be preserved, however the request may prompt some official statement about the 'nature' of the payload (i.e. it doesn't violate NZ law etc). It's more or less a bit of a curiosity. (Note: the link above to the stuff article appears incorrect - it was linking to the ars Firefly article for me.)

The compromise on phase 2 seems to trade short term benefits (or at least avoid active detriment) for ULA, for medium/long term benefits for SpaceX and BO, ULA gets to avoid the tougher accountability of the original proposal (this was undoubtedly there for the purposes of this compromise) and can use the same Fairing provider as SpaceX, In exchange SpaceX gets money for capabilities that are useful for government payloads but are either less useful or utterly redundant for commercial payloads (stretch fairing and VIF perspectively) and BO will get the chance to get a few nat sec missions under them in advance of phase 3.
They are, they have a lot of resources, they can handle multiple projects at once.
International tracking purposes is why disclosure on payloads to space is pretty standard
mhalpern wrote: ULA [...] can use the same Fairing provider as SpaceX, Number 3: Quote: 3) That the secretary of defense ensure all competitors have equal access to materials and suppliers. Is the other way round I believe - SpaceX wanted to be able to use the same fairing supplier (more specifically the same components) as ULA (presumably so they wouldn't have to design a larger fairing from scratch). #3 is one of the removed ones, so there's no change there. Though supposedly, according to the supplier in question, SpaceX is free to use the same supplier anyway. Edit: Clarity
I think they have more than one engineering team.
If you consider the HazMat placards, 100% of the time. Unless you're the U.S. government which tranports rockets, missles and other military explosives in tractor trailers marked as Chiquita bananas.
has there been any information on why they changed the falcon heavy center core landing from just at the coast to ~1200km downrange?
From what I've read that is correct, they can use RUAG but the fairing would have to be a new design that either RUAG or SpaceX or them jointly comes up with. Given the costs of a new design, SpaceX may just say f it and build it themselves. The point with going with RUAG was they had a fairing that meets the certification already so it wouldn't have a lot of dev fees. If they have to build a new one just for this that eliminates the savings, plus then likely requires it to be launched at least once to certify it works. If they have to do all that they can probably do it cheaper in house. The rarity of launches that need it made the higher cost of buying it off the shelf the better option, but not if they have to develop a new one from scratch. Supposedly the current one RUAG has was developed with help from ULA so that's why they can't sell it. Course one could argue that given the subsidies ULA has been given over the years it's more likely tax payer funded but as opaque as their finances have been it's impossible to prove.
I would think the BE-3 engine team is the one also doing the work on BE-7 as they share a lot in common. BE-4 however has yet to do a full power test and that's a problem. If they can't get it to full thrust Vulcan can't meet the performance targets it needs without going to more or larger SRB's. By schedule they are over a year behind on engine certification. Not hitting those targets would also change New Glenn. Unfortunately they appear to be a black box when it comes to info on those engines.
Also interested in this! Also a bit OT but I would love to have the upvote categories include a ""good question"" or similar. ""Adds to story"" just doesn't feel right for a question as yet unanswered.

Ariane 5 just has its second launch of 2019. Last year A5 launched a total of 6 times. This trend is not a good sign for Ariane 6. The competitive landscape won't get any easier when BO starts launching payloads on New Glenn.
Different starting diameter, different fairing

Is the other way round I believe - SpaceX wanted to be able to use the same fairing supplier (more specifically the same components) as ULA (presumably so they wouldn't have to design a larger fairing from scratch). #3 is one of the removed ones, so there's no change there. Though supposedly, according to the supplier in question, SpaceX is free to use the same supplier anyway. Edit: Clarity From what I've read that is correct, they can use RUAG but the fairing would have to be a new design that either RUAG or SpaceX or them jointly comes up with. Given the costs of a new design, SpaceX may just say f it and build it themselves. The point with going with RUAG was they had a fairing that meets the certification already so it wouldn't have a lot of dev fees. If they have to build a new one just for this that eliminates the savings, plus then likely requires it to be launched at least once to certify it works. If they have to do all that they can probably do it cheaper in house. The rarity of launches that need it made the higher cost of buying it off the shelf the better option, but not if they have to develop a new one from scratch. Supposedly the current one RUAG has was developed with help from ULA so that's why they can't sell it. Course one could argue that given the subsidies ULA has been given over the years it's more likely tax payer funded but as opaque as their finances have been it's impossible to prove. Different starting diameter, different fairing The main difference is the boat tail end of the fairing, the rest is the same. Or rather would have been the same.
To be fair the new JJ timeline is missing a great many Vulcans.
The droneship octograbber has the necessary mods now to hold down a FH core.
Third times the charm? Course with this longer distance landing I expect a pretty toasty landing attempt. Only reason to go that far downrange is to use more of it's performance so less reserves for landing. Might even be one of the rare three engine landing burns. I put the odds at 50/50 for a successful recovery and will be pleasantly surprised if it succeeds.
This would increase the margins available for the second stage. On this mission it will be doing 4 burns with 3 payload deployment phases over something like 6 hours. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1141375028321062912
Is that for real?
If it is, that's a mighty big middle finger he threw at them!
Taking on such a unique one-off plane like that is like buying a St. Bernard puppy. At first it seems cute but later it will eat you out of house and home and you will be shovelling tons of shit.
I wonder if Rocket Lab's history of questionable payloads had anything to do with the requirement to disclose.... https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/01 ... t-weekend/
Aye, but at least they have the famously good weather up there in northern Scotland going for them. [/S]
I love that this Falcon Heavy will ride on scorched side boosters: Spoiler: show I don't know when the thrill of a Heavy launch will wear off, but this is not the time
This is somewhat common in business when buying distressed/abandoned assets. He's offering to pay ""$1"" for the physical object, but the exchange is that Virgin would pay all the maintenance costs after that.
Probably around the time Starship starts launching
In the United States, yes. There are these things called weigh stations that long haul trucks are required to stop at along the major Interstate Highways. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weigh_station I do believe there are varying regulations for trains based on federal and state laws for the carriage of potentially hazardous materials. Ships, there's lots of laws depending on where it's going and how it intends to get there.
Considering that I still find Falcon 9 launches quite thrilling, Falcon Heavy will likely never get old! Especially when you consider BFR/Starship - as awesome as that will be, it'll still be a single stack. Falcon Heavy with 3 cores landing may well be unique in the future of rocketry. Seeing 2 of them land almost simultaneously that first Tesla launch is something I'll never forget. Last edited by DLJD on Fri Jun 21, 2019 8:19 am
...and assume any lingering debt, as well. $400 million is way less than what that company spent to get where it, err, was.
I love learning about new shit.
They seem to be pulling an awful lot of detail out of drawings that have a rather ""artistic"" take on realism. AFAIK, we don't know of any monkey species that curls it tail up into a 4 layer deep spiral for instance...
Seems like they figured out how to make long straight and parallel lines, so that's what they did. Nothing about the figure is proportional to any real bird.
To be fair, ya have to be thinking like a native of naboo to get a sense of this thing. I'm sure the aliens that did this were thinking Borg says ""hey Korg, lets put something funny here before we leave this planet."" Korg says ""Ok, how about a drawing of that weird bird we saw on that desert planet last year? That will really take them a while to figure out."" Last edited by Thr2hrmrf on Sat Jun 22, 2019 6:32 pm
The reason? Drugs, man. Really, REALLY good drugs, man.
Like the others, I'd only caution against being overly literal. I would not ever imagine (for example) that Aztec carvings of Quetzalcoatl were inspired by an actual feathered snake man.
FTFY
Sure they were. They were called dinosaurs.
It feels tenuous to draw specific biological conclusions about what species these drawings depict; like tossing out potential creative license.
I wonder if they were drawing pictures for God.
Considering how that figure is drawn with six separate popsicle sticks instead of bird-like wings, I'm not convinced that details like that are reliable.
Tsk, tsk, tsk! 450 square km is not 280 square miles! It's about 174 sq mi...
Ancient aliens? Please. So cliche. The most logical conclusion is that they're the work of bored time travelers wanting to mess with people. Like crop circles, but taken to the nth degree.
The archaeologists go to is always ""ritual device"" or structure. In this case that is extreeemely likely to be the correct answer. Or...its possible a snippet of a song snapped back through the space time continuum and what they were listening to Morrison sing about ""petition the lord with prayer"". Unfortunately that was all they got. In seriousness they have a host of artifacts that suggest something similar to Tibetan sacred walking paths. Where offerings of special votives (specifically spondylas shells and water jugs) were given to the gods, likely to try to gain water or food from the gods.
It must have been some really strong beliefs about some very serious issue which motivated this complex behavior.
This is like a psychologist creating a new disease from a few symptoms. Seeing that they can't identify many of the glyphs how can they have any certainty about the ones ""identified?"" The article is claiming the birds that aren't even believed to be found in the area! I seem to remember arstechnica writers using scepticism when interpreting studies. Lately there seems to be less critical evaluation. I much prefer the critical evaluations
Don't be so sure... there are some pretty potent drugs the shamans in that part of the world still use. Feathered snake men is tame in comparison to some of the stuff that'll make you see.
Most of the creatures in the glyphs are not found in the area*. The monkeys and hummingbirds (if they are hummingbirds, though I think its pretty hard to determine species from a diagram since trained bioligists have a hard time even with live birds) are from the other side of the Andes divide. *If you have ever been there there is very little in the way of animal or vegatal life. (its the Atacama desert!) I went there by bus from Lima and the Atacama is truly empty. We stopped for a bathroom break and as far as could be detected there was not one living thing in view. No bugs. No animals, no plants. no dead bugs, dead plants or dead animals. Rocks and sand for as far as the eye could see. We drove through it for hours and hours. Absofuckinlutely nothing alive. Bizarre and kinda creepy. Makes the Sonoran desert or the PNW basin look like a true oasis.
Psychologists don't identify diseases.
""It's drugs"" is as tiresome a cliche as ""it's aliens."" The human mind is capable of imagining many strange and wonderful things all by itself.
https://nypost.com/2019/06/20/scientist ... zca-lines/ From that article: The researchers wrote: “The amount of rainfall in the highlands was estimated by observing the migrations of seabirds. “When seabirds migrate to mountainous regions of the Nazca pampas during November and December, it is expected that rain will fall in the highlands. On the other hand, if migrating seabirds are not observed, water shortages are feared.” They concluded that the ancient Peruvian people thought the birds carried the weather with them and brought seawater to the hills and rain from the rainforests. The carvings could, therefore, be signs of honoring the birds, worshipping them or hoping for them to come back.
Note: I haven't read the paper but … Different cultures will emphasize different things in their artwork (or even plain prose records). If you have evidence of certain known animals and you know that, for instance, they are consistently accurate in the number of fingers/toes/talons, or in proportions with respect to body length, you can assume that for a new drawing the same hold up (likewise, if you know they are consistently inaccurate with respect to certain qualities, you can safely ignore them).
Maybe. But when I was a kid, we'd stomp our name in huge letters in the snow just for fun. These drawings are a little more elaborate than that, but I'd be hesitant to try to draw out motivation based on the drawings alone.
it is clearly a humming bird.
It is clearly a very fancy fork.
Ah the search for Akator continues.
This post is crazy timely for me as I just saw them in person yesterday, both the lines of Nazca and Palpa!
Is just Mayan (or whatever they were at that time) Graffiti. They've found hummingbird, probably was a guy/girl who wouldn't stay quiet and someone gave him/her the idea, from there all the teenagers started writing their 'names'... Joking (or maybe not?)
I'm have a slight reservation about labelling it a hummingbird, and then backing that conclusion with """"Our findings show they drew exotic birds, not local birds, and this could be a clue as to why they drew them in the first place,"" said Eda in a statement. But the team wasn't able to identify all 16 birds. A few, which most archaeologists labeled condors or flamingos, stubbornly defied ornithological labels. Their detailed features didn't match either condors or flamingos, according to Eda and his colleagues, but they didn't match any other living Peruvian birds, either. It's possible that those figures represent an extinct (or locally extinct) species—or perhaps they were just inaccurate drawings."" A few things bother me about the drawings; whilst the tail is symetrical, the feet and wings are not. For some reason, despite being able to draw 5 ""tail feathers"" that are almost identical in width and length, they were unable to make the opposing ""wings"" the same width and spacing. Nor are the feet symmetrical. And why is the nose out of proportion? Just minor, but glaringly obvious discrepancies. If the original artists were trying to simulate motion or ""true life"", then the tail would be different, they would recreate the same perspective that the 'wings' and 'feet' show. Maybe Impressionists existed even back then. But to instantly label them ""birds"" and then hunt for evidence to support the theory, to me niggles. As equally as they might be highly stylized animals, they might be non-local animals, or, equally likely, they might represent something entirely different. I think we can dismiss ""inaccurate drawings"" - if they could get a ground-based drawing that was only evident from above so accurate in so many respects (in terms of equally sized and spaced straight lines) I dont see them making mistakes of accuracy. Its rather like the delta-winged golden artifact; that was labelled a ""bird"", even though no bird ever had a delta wing, nor a flat non-aerodynamic forward-facing ridge. https://sites.google.com/site/vovodroid ... ayan-plane
If we need to debate the meaning of ancient enormous drawings....let's stick with the ones that foster real, thought-provoking debate, eh?
The Cerne Abbas giant only dates to the 1650s.
That's always been a consideration. But if there was some sort of foreman for the effort, and was observing progress from an elevation that was slightly off to the side, the angle of his perspective might account for that. Also, there may have been teams on various parts, and after all that effort, it was close enough. There is plenty left to discover about these.
If the birds they depicted were not present in the area, but they knew they provide the precious guano, maybe they were trying to lure them to come over and provide them with copious amounts of them? And since they were far, far away, they needed to make them really large. [Kidding, kinda]
Funny guy, but nah - Quetzalcoatl wasn't really a lizard deity. He's part of a whole family of mesoamerican sky/rain/wind deities usually concieved as snakes and related to the coming of rains, agricultural fertility, favorable winds, and the beginning of the growing season - basically, a god of climate. The Aztecs also believed in Tlaloc, which was a rain and water deity, but a lot of religions in the area combined the roles into one. The Utes believed that the sky was ice, and that a feathered rainbow serpent slithered across it, scraping the ice off with his scales and letting it fall as rain.
""the geoglyph previously identified as a hummingbird (Geoglyph No. PV68A-CF1) is actually a close relative called a hermit""

Maybe it's just me, but I'm not familiar with Nasca Lines and would've appreciated an up-front synopsis of what they were, how they may have been made, and the actual scale. Unless I missed it, there's no indication in the article - ""300 enormous figures spread across 450 square kilometers (280 miles)"" (near the end of the article!) doesn't cover how large the actual figures are! To wikipedia I go...

Who are these ""Amercans"" you speak of?

Musk is going to be having underwater sex with Europan aliens before NASA builds a moon base.
Count me as pleasantly surprised at Americans' rankings of space priorities in that AP poll. Maybe there's hope for us after all.
Because of American's highly skewed perception of how much of the budget NASA actually gets, it makes the long term space goals, like Moon or Mars, of any administration an easy target for whichever party doesn't have the presidency, and in some cases a target of opportunity even for the same party. I don't expect this to change any time soon. The best we can hope for is that there's enough general support for private space companies, not necessarily in terms of throwing government money at them, but at least not actively impeding them, that those companies can do it themselves.
This idiocracy would never discover America. They would be still ""protecting Europe"" in the year 3000.
Turn off your GPS please.
Computer / smartphone too.
That would be basically my entire friends list when I share anything from this site on FB for starters... It makes me sad no one sees how important this is as a species.
There are parts of NASA that are doing really good work. Then there are the folks managing SLS and Orion. Don't throw out the baby with the pork water.
We had one for a while, although its focus was a little different. Recall that DC-X was originally built and flown by SDIO.
Given how rapidly public interest waned even during the latter Apollo landings, I think ""we're not making good progress"" is not the biggest factor. Once we'd done the thing and beaten the Russians, people didn't care even when it was happening, when progress was immediate and visible. I think the bigger problem is that nobody does a very good job of articulating why people should care. Or more exactly, why they should treat crewed spaceflight as a national priority. There's no race to win. ""For the science"" is a good answer why they should care a little bit, but maybe not billions-and-billions level of care. ""To colonize the system and safeguard the species"" sounds hopelessly out of touch. And after that...?
One of the things that technophobic dipshits like to do is to point at all kinds of research spending as ""wasteful"". It doesn't matter if the spending is for space research, health research or any other sort of research, they want it stopped and diverted to what they think is important.
You mean like spending hundreds of billions in the military industrial complex protecting the country from enemies?
I find it difficult to contemplate how 50 billion over 15 years is a lot of money when compared to the Federal budget which is close to 4 trillion (2015), the NIH budget is close to 20 billion a year, heck, the last Congress proposed adding 10 billion to the budget overnight to build 'Wall'. The fiscal stimulus in '08 to bail out the financial sector was close to 700 billion. The Iraq war cost at least a couple of trillion. 50 billion over 15 years is a rounding error. The more likely explanation is that you have a combination of 1. a population that has been squeezed for every nickel and dime for the last 30 years - stagnant wages, rising education and care costs, and 2. a less literate population that likely no longer understands how science works let alone its importance 3. politicians that will not advocate the importance of science out of ignorance or moral cowardice. Or much more eloquently...   - (Carl Sagan- Demon-Haunted World), In case it needs a citation) Last edited by Oz7 on Thu Jun 20, 2019 3:43 pm
GPS isn’t NASA. It’s also not human space flight.
The problem is that a good chunk of those hundreds of billions isn't so much spent protecting the country from enemies, as making new ones.
On the other hand, SLS and Orion spending isn't well spent. It's pork for the aerospace industry that is years behind schedule and over budget (with no prospect of change).
Parts of NASA are basically doing this. The administration moon plan isn't just SLS and shelby and One Big Plan, there's room and funding for tons of bidders. And if someone *coughmuskcough* comes up with something that works better, it seems likely that a pretty quick pivot would be in order.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)
People are very excited about new things. Going to the moon repeatedly is not new things. Shuttle goes up, exciting! Shuttle goes up 100 times, ho hum. There’s top-of-the-hour news about the first landing on a comet, about the first rover on an asteroid, about the first images of Pluto, about the first image of a black hole, etc. People are excited to get a move on. They aren’t excited about promises to go to the Moon where we’ve already been, or promises to go to Mars in 20 years when we already heard that promise 30 years ago or more.
Or just . . . well, let NASA be NASA. Give them a target, an appropriate budget for the target, and let them do what they do, sans Congressional pork and Presidential and pony shows. Creating a new Government Agency to do the same thing as an old Government Agency, just 'more agile', usually ignores that the old Agency isn't agile/modern/budget conscious/focused primarily because the powers that be won't fund it, give contradictory missions, have a grudge, have a pet project, want to see it fail, can't pass a multi year budget plan, can't get an appropriation cleared before the end of a fiscal year, etc. Parallel agencies also can end up robbing Peter to pay Paul in terms of budget and brain trust.
what NASA should do shouldn't be a democratic process. an individual is going to be concerned about groceries, their job or picking their kid up. has to be something from a head with a vision of the overall goal for society and the future. i guess i understand the poll in terms of what to say in order to streamline your campaign speech. 2 cents.
I was entertained and bemused by OP's idea that what's holding NASA back is an insufficient embrace of buzzwords
Yeah, so. Americans also voted for Trump and Hilary in fairly equal measure. I want to leave this planet ASAP.
It's not necessarily that the amount is huge (it isn't), but Ares V, SLS, and Orion spending isn't productive either -- because it hasn't lived up to its promises. Dropping $50,000,000,000 on aerospace contractors to fail to deliver rockets isn't awesome.
I'm surprised it fared as well as it did, given: 1. Decades of public education being underfunded and gutted. 2. Tons of people being too selfish and shortsighted to understand the importance of NASA's activities. ""Oh big whoop, some telescope in orbit. Waste of MAH TAXES!"" 3. Corporate and social media focusing on sensationalist horseshit and whatever fuels the current outrage of the hour. 4. The middle class isn't doing so well, historically speaking. Kind of hard to sit down and contemplate our species' future in space if you're worried sick due to being underemployed, sucked into the black hole known as ""the gig economy,"" and so forth. Combined with #1 through #3... 5. Lack of a viable other to point at and say ""We've gotta beat them!"" If China keeps humming along doing their thing, should it start becoming clear they're nearing the ability to land people on the moon and are about to do just that... get ready for a whiplash-inducing about-face from tons of Americans.
If you want a view of the future on Earth without a frontier like space, read 1984, and consider that Orwell was an optimist.

What about beneficial implications for life on Earth? You can't solve problems without thinking outside the box sphere.
...What on earth (or off of it) does creeping authoritarianism have to do with abandonment of spaceflight? Maybe you could explain using the PRC as an example?
Wait, what? What is it about humans that condemns us to totalitarian government? And what about Space magically averts that? I don't understand that argument in the slightest.

What else besides vaccines could be printed makes legalities over 3D printed guns look childish. I can imagine no greater nightmare than thousands of these devices, all ready to produce the worst pathogens humankind has ever discovered or created. All you need is the right code... Hard pass. These machines should never get out of highly secure labs.
Science Fiction is rife with examples of disasters countered with this kind of technology, from Larry Niven's ""Autodoc"" to the 4th Dr. Who using a diagnostic/manufacturing machine to create an antidote for Leela. I've always wondered whether or not such a thing might be available in my lifetime.

Requiring physical access and informed consent could relieve some of these anxieties but I'm not sure what either would look like in practice. We'd be installing an attack surface, the key advantages of which are being non-invasive and expedient, hence ""remote"" at least over very short distances, which is a bit spooky. Consent might be a bit controversial in the throes of anti-vaccination-fueled outbreaks but it's still central to the ethics of modern medicine. Automatically ""pushing updates"" is a non-starter in my opinion, for several reasons.
Internet commenters .
The fast-tracking of bio-fixes described here is a wonderful idea, but unrealistic. We can't even get patches correct to computing devices that are many magnitudes simpler. Then consider the technical attack vectors, such as bad actor adding themselves to download pipelines and injecting who knows what. The benefits of the current slow process might actually outweigh the truly unfortunate aspects of not getting medications to folks quickly enough. I'd say no on this in my neighborhood, thanks though for adding the clever concepts to the world. Maybe some day.
In my opinion, the drug is ready
Implanted bio-chips... what could possibly go wrong?
That may well be relative. If I am an immune-compromised 90 year old I think I would take the risk of a computer virus killing me, over the near guarantee of any random virus doing so.
I'm sure you wouldn't be able to print bacteria, and even viruses are fairly complex (but not out of the question). On the other hand, if you can print proteins and other compounds, you can probably produce any number of illegal drugs.

Right - because digital printing doesn't...scale? I'll read your comment later to see if you addressed the point.
There is an underlying premise in this article that we can easily introduce foreign DNA into our bodies and reverse-transcription will spontaneously occur. This is a false one. It is extremely difficult. Our bodies create many safeguards specifically to prevent uptake of foreign DNA. In fact, this is why the best delivery system is an adeno-associated virus, the same type as HIV. Humans haven’t come close to creating a better delivery system. Your best bet is to stick to using bio-printers at local hospitals that can create vaccines based off templates.
In the future they will do away with the messy prenatal biology and just 3D print the babies....
You can print scales with 3D printers, or hairs.....
Thank you Markgo. My sentiments exactly. Not to mention that this is an illegal (designer) drug suppliers wet dream come true! ""Whatcha want? Uppers? Downer? I can give you anything you want. Just give the printer thirty minutes to print it up for ya!""
When ISIS hacks the printer as turns you into patient zero of an epidemic, killing your family, maybe not that happy.
Calling an automated peptide synthesiser a 'vaccine printer' sounds like the sort of bafflegab that the very shameless might deign to use to impress the kind of venture capitalists who lack competent scientific advisors. Synthesise a short peptide or DNA stretch: fine. Probably the peptide won't fold correctly, I would be extremely surprised if ""printing"" ricin gave you working ricin. Inject DNA into cells of a living organism and call it a vaccine: much less fine. If this worked we'd have been doing it for forty years.
That is just the beginning of the issues. This is not my area of expertise but IIRC from my undergrad days (several decades ago!) biologicals almost always have post RNA manipulation to add things or connect things.
Printing at a pharmacy sounds reasonable, but at home and in skin printing sounds insanely stupid. The very same technology that could and should be used for creating said vaccines very likely could and would be used to create localized epidemics or people trying to create a disease thus producing something potentially dangerous and killing themselves/family accidental or otherwise. I'm also quite pessimistic and cynical of how well people could operate the required machinery and keeping it secure. I've known countless individuals with extremely easy WiFi passwords or just no security at all, countless people who don't understand what email is despite having an email address and using it for over 20 years, and I could name all kinds of other insane levels of incompetence when it comes to any kind of electronic technology. With the flip-side of this coin being people like the Nuclear Boy-Scout who made a neutron source in a shed with americium he got from smoke detectors + thorium and radium from other sources... Just think about it like this; Currently it takes 1 really dumb individual and or a 0 day exploit to bring large companies to their knees with a crypto-infection. Imagine THAT with something like this but at every single house... I have my doubts for the at pharmacy level but I feel like concerns I have can be greatly mitigated in terms of scale if not entirely eliminated with proper pre-cautions, set-up and training.
Having spent decades in pharmacies I doubt this will be in any pharmacy in the next 10 years.
Printing other medications might be even simpler. The parasite capitalists will oppose it with every effort they can spare.
I'm pretty sure this was an episode of Almost Human.

While we are at it, why don't we just build a miniature BSL-3 lab in every home as well? Maybe the CDC can send a couple of monkeys to each house once in a while for testing. Let's crowdsource infectious disease research. /s Echoing others' sentiment, it's really odd to see this kind of article on Ars.

I support the 3d printing of vaccines so long as the 3d printer looks exactly like the artistic rendering at the top of this article.
I think the author of this piece has a way more optimistic view of chem printers than most biochemist do. Its not just (""just""!) placing a string of atoms in the correct order which is already way beyond our capabilities, its also making sure that the structure is correct (and identical strings of atoms can twist in multiple ways), AND you need to make sure that you arent getting side products and reactions. In my opinion we are a LONG way away from printing drugs or even the simplest chemical structures on demand. This is a highly non trivial area. I probably will be downrated for being for being Negative Nancy, but this strikes me as a ""we will all have rocket belts soon"" article.
I'm picturing that robot walking up to someone with an anti-fact/vax protest signand saying in GLADOS' voice ""I'm vaccinating you for your own good. For science. You are too delusional and brainwashed to understand, but you will thank me for this later,"" grabbing them, and doin' some science to them.
And thus the robot wars begin....leading to the extinction of human kind......
If you find this topic interesting I highly recommend The End of the World with Josh Clark as another podcast. It is relatively short at 10 episodes but does a good mid-level die into existential risks.
17,000 nuclear warheads in the world. And more people willing to obtain them. You think they will not be used? We are all dead. i just hope it's after I'm gone.
Hmm. I think the vaccine robot could be made smaller and less intimidating. How about one of those cuff things that take your blood pressure at the grocery store with a needle in it?
And yet they have not for nearly a century now. Nukes are hardly the problem anyways, they're just the media boogieman. Chem/Bio is far more likely to be used with conventional weaponry obviously used far more frequently (see Novichok and VX). Fortunately the nutty nations that want them to ""wipe their enemies from the map"" will be curb stomped long before getting to the point of kicking off WWIII. Not even Russia wants a nuclear war, bad for business. China, not in speech but actions, appeared ready to abandon the Norks if they tested a nuclear ICBM knowing the US would wipe them out instantly afterwards (they set up a bunch of refugee camps on the border indicating they had no plans to help the Norks or let nukes fly). All the corruption and embezzlement means nothing if you have to hunker in a bunker for the rest of your life. Be glad the demagogues have far less power than people credit to them. The real power is with some shadowy stone faced general who would laugh in a politicians face if they demanded a strike because their feelings were hurt. You're naive if you think the politicians, with zero real world experience and minimal vetting, have much power over the nuclear arsenal. The fact conventional arms are regularly used even when two major powers engage in a proxy war demonstrates no one is interested in actually using nukes. Love the bomb and embrace MAD, it's kept the peace and that genie is already out of the bottle. We've been FAR closer to the brink before against world superpowers and came back. Right now humanity is in a relatively peaceful era with less disease, poverty, war, and that is thanks to technology removing the need to bash each other over the head with clubs to survive. The world isn't some Tom Clancy novel, we are not constantly having someone out to blow it up. Even the lunatics that want to blow something up have rather limited goals in mind all things considered. You can't honestly think if one of these loonie nations nukes someone unprovoked that anyone would bat a eye if the US glassed them in response? The major powers will whine and carry on about how evil the US is, pass some empty bills against it, but ultimately use it to further their interests rather than sacrifice the world over some rogue nation. Besides, there is a major issue with randos using nukes... it isn't nearly that simple. You don't ""just get a nuke"" and ""use it"". No, humanity will be around a long time yet. I'm more worried about a GRB or Asteroid than anything we can do to ourselves.
There is always hope. It reminds me of a line in the 1970 ""Beneath The Planet of the Apes"" movie. Taylor: when may be hope to be free? Guard: you may hope any time you like.
LOL @ waiting for my lunch break
That cyborg looks like he's ready to KEEEEEEL ME!
I hope for a successful deployment of the sail. Perhaps this method of transport can be proven to be viable for sending robots and supplies at low cost to distant parts of the solar system.
I simply want to know what acceleration rates they're expecting. A 32 sq meter sail for a mere 5 kg ""ship"", I don't see this being a viable movement option for ""sailing among the stars"" (hyperbole of course; still love ya Bill Nye, and Count Dooku too...) and not great for getting around just from Earth around our own solar system, is it? Found it in the source article: http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-da ... ail-2.html   Will still be an interesting experiment, I'm all ears on results!
Solar sails seem like a relatively dormant technology for this use case. If time is no issue, repeated gravity assists will get you pretty much anywhere in the neighborhood with relatively little propellant. There are also overhead costs to consider, which do not necessarily favor the long-duration mission plan. People need to manage these things, even when the spacecraft are mostly just coasting.
Recommended BGM for when reading the article? https://youtu.be/yRvVyMuWbpM
No, no, the Founders didn't use solar sails. That was the ancient Bajorans.
Reducing that type of overhead is something that in the long run we do need to work on reducing. Additionally, the solar sails might be useful for station keeping and orbital changes for satellites extending their life and providing the delta V necessary to deorbit the satellite.
Elsewhere they quote 0.058 mm/s^2. That's small but comparable to solar-electric ion propulsion. The Dawn spacecraft, for example, accelerates at 0.08 mm/s^2 (assuming I converted correctly from pop sci articles giving a 4-day 0-60 mph time). That's been useful for a very successful tour of the asteroid belt, with extended visits of Vesta and Ceres. So there's potentially a lot of near term use for solar sails to power inner solar system probes, or potentially to be used for satellite station keeping.
Once this experiment is over, I'm wondering if it will provide enough data for an extrapolated chart on sail size and accelleration for a given mass. It would be interesting to know how useful this might be for sending missions. Imagine if you will, a pluto mission where all of the chemical fuel on the craft can be saved for deceleration to put it into orbit.
Nice! Thanks for putting it in context!
In theory, inter-solar-system light sails can get to 0.1c. This is the fastest way we will explore other stars with crafts.
As one of the people whose donations helped pay for this, I'm even more excited for the launch than I normally am when SpaceX is flying.
We likely lost a lot of data from Galileo because using gravity assists damaged the high-gain antenna (the engineering team believed the additional heat from going near Venus degraded the lubricant and caused the antenna to fail to deploy). With a solar sail built according to Louis Friedman's estimates of sail performance, Galileo could have gone on a direct injection and arrived about a year earlier without the damaging fly-by of Venus. The sail could then have returned to Earth and been available in the late 90s to take another probe somewhere.
This project is the only Kickstarter I have ever participated in. It was supposed to go up with the first Falcon Heavy, and the launch has been delayed by several years. I’m super excited to see how it goes. I also highly recommend joining the Planetary Society. Not only does it help support projects like this, the magazine they send out every few months has some really great articles.
There is also the thought that space has a lot of, well, space, so if we want to spread ridiculous sails to propel comparatively tiny craft, well, why not, if it works? We're not gonna run outta room any time soon.
Perhaps one day, if solar sails become the norm for long distance missions, it will be among those ""duh!"" historical footnotes that young people cite. ""Can you believe they used chemical rockets for deep space probes!""
Specifically, LightSail 2 (a.k.a. LightSail-B) is a ""3U"" cubesat (34-cm long dimension, 5 kg mass). It will deploy from Georgia Tech's ""Prox-1"" spacecraft (61 cm, 71 kg) which will observe the sail. Prox-1 is one of 12 rideshare payloads on the STP-2 mission: COSMIC-2, part of a six-satellite constellation to collect atmospheric data via radio occultation; DSX, which will measure the space radiation environment; NASA's GPIM, to develop less-toxic propellants; NRL's NPSAT, for space weather; the OCULUS ground-observation calibration target; OTB, carrying several tech demonstrations; and five other cubesats. The Planetary Society has various festivities planned for this launch, including a lecture and fancy dinner at the KSC Visitor Center. I decided to forego it, because it's scheduled for 23:30 local, and if I'm going to witness the drama of a Falcon Heavy launch-and-landing, I want to do it during daylight. References: * http://www.planetary.org/explore/projec ... r-sailing/ * http://www.prox-1.gatech.edu/ * https://www.spacex.com/STP-2 Disclosure: I'm a Society member, and I've donated to the project since Cosmos 1.
I'd be interested to learn more about this, because I've never heard the suggestion that the Galileo antenna failure was in any way related to the Venus fly-by. Typically this failure is blamed on the fact that the spacecraft sat in storage for several years. JPL gives the Venus flyby closest approach as about 10,000mi, so it's difficult to believe the spacecraft experienced any meaningful heating.
The other thing not to be forgotten is that once you have enough solar sails in use, it would potentially become practical to build an orbital system to ship photons to boost the solar sail's performance. This is especially true in early stages of the flight when near Earth. Having a giant space lasers for this doesn't make sense unless you have enough targets to justify it, but increasing thrust without increasing weight makes a huge difference in acceleration over time. One of those launch once and use many times piece of infrastructure.
Crazy Eddie says hi
I believe your math is off. Accelerating at .000058 m/s^2 for 5.5 years (~173,448,000 seconds) will provide 10,060 m/s of velocity, or 36,216 km/h of velocity, not 10 km/h. Edit: My gut instinct guess without seeing your math is that you got to 10,060 m/s and changed that to 10.06 km/s and added it to 28080 km/h without making sure the unit in the denominator matched. Last edited by The Dark on Thu Jun 20, 2019 10:06 am
In addition all of that the Planetary Society along with the National Space Society is one of the two major pro-space lobbying groups in the US. If you want your Congressional representatives to hear messages other than ""give Shelby his pork and he'll let you get yours"" I'd strongly recommend joining one or both of them. IF you're not sure which to support, their focus's are slightly different: The Planetary Society is about unmanned probes; in addition to the solar sails they've been building it also had an experiment on the failed Phobos Grunt mission that would've carried a selection of biological samples ranging from bacteria to tardigrades to/from Phobos to test their ability to survive interplanetary radiation as would be needed for the panspermia hypotheses. The NSS's primary goal is manned spaceflight leading to ""people living and working in space"". They haven't built any tech demonstrator probes/etc; but do engage in STEM outreach with various student focused contests whose winners are honored at their annual conference.
I think you dropped a zero somewhere. I cheated and used an online acceleration calculator. Starting speed: 28,080km/h Acceleration: 0.000058m/s2 Speed at 1 year: 34,669km/h 5 years: 61,026km/h 10 years: 93,972 km/h
Ion thrusters have come a long way in the decades since the peak popularity of solar sails, and that really boxes in the types of missions where solar sails can win the trade studies. We're talking unmanned probes to the outer solar system and beyond which don't need to maneuver very precisely in order to rendezvous with particular objects of interest. Meanwhile we'll have tens of thousands of commercial satellites in orbit sporting ion drives which keep getting cheaper and more efficient, providing excellent off-the-shelf propulsion for scientific spacecraft. A successful demonstration of LightSail 2 might lead to a series of larger technology demonstrations in the future, but where it goes from there is unclear.
I think your math is off. FWIW I normally just use the version of Units that can be run with any Google search: ""0.058 mm/s^2 * 5.5 years in kph"" returns ""36 239.9738 kilometers per hour"". But to show my work a little more carefully: 0.058 mm/s^2 * (1 km /1,000,000 mm) * (3600 seconds/hr)^2 = 0.75 km/hr^2 0.75 km/hr^2 * 5.5 years * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year = 36135 km/hr Which is only slightly off the Units conversion because it uses a more accurate figure for hours/year.
Are you expecting planetary researchers of the future to have significantly longer lifespans and career lengths than they currently have?
Yay! Somebody else who has read 'The Mote in God's Eye'!
Dumb question here. So I visualize mylar like the reflective mylar balloons. But I'm guessing these solar sails are actually blackish in color so they can absorb the photons rather than reflect them. So what color is the sail and is it the most efficient for absorbing the photons' momentum? -d Last edited by Person_Man on Thu Jun 20, 2019 10:13 am
No, your first thought was correct. They're normally highly reflective.
Never mind the fact that our instruments are still getting better and we're still reformulating our questions based on recent discoveries. An in-transit probe is a probe which is flying older hardware designed to answer older questions. That doesn't make them valueless by any stretch of the imagination, but Juno built on Galileo, and Galileo built on the Voyagers, and the Voyagers built on the Pioneers.
I already closed out of the Excel workbook I was using, so can't easily recheck my work, but your post and the two others (so far) that you ninja'ed are more than enough for me [edit] Back to what I love about Ars, in general. I can essentially ask a question based on how I understand things (right or wrong) and get amazing (and cordial) follow-ups setting me straight. I can only imagine what the responses and down-votes would have looked like on Reddit and the like. Last edited by rosen380 on Thu Jun 20, 2019 10:42 am
They added a sunshade to the probe when the flyby was added because of concern that going closer to the Sun than Earth orbit would damage the instruments. They were tweaking the flight profile as the probe approached Venus because the back of the shade was getting hotter than anticipated. To run the sunshade, they had to reprogram the computer. One of the drivers that had to be removed was the antenna motor reverse. When it jammed, they could only keep trying to drive the motor forward, there was no way to back it to try to get momentum.
Actually, the more reflective the better. If you absorb the photon you get it's momentum. If you reflect it you get twice it's momentum.
You were right the first time. You want the photon's to be reflected because you get 2x the photons momentum applied to the sail when they are. 1x to absorb it, and 1x to send it back the way it came.
So, if the sail is 4m x 5.6m, how does it have 32 m^2 of area? A 4x5.6 rectangle would be 22.4 m^2, so is this some sort of pyramidal shape (e.g., the ""area"" isn't the area of the projection orthogonal to the sun, but rather the total amount of fabric)?
The other half though is that running out of propellant limits the total amount of science a probe can do. Cassini spent half its maneuvering fuel in the first few years after arrival to max out the science they done early to protect against a premature failure. That meant a much lower rate of moon flyby's for the remainder because they had very little propellant left to nudge its orbit into place for gravity assists off of other moons. If they could have fitted it with a solar sail big enough to work at ~9.5AU they could have continued visiting targets of interest at the same rate for the entire duration of the missions. While Saturn likely is too far out for a near future sail to be effective; the asteroid belt is a much easier mission (~10-25% of the light pressure felt at earth vs ~1%). That could have allowed mission like Dawn to keep visiting additional asteroids until other systems failed instead of entering a graveyard orbit around Ceres when its propellant was exhausted.
Umm…the only version of this song I'm familiar with is by Styx. And as spacey as some of Rush's songs sound, a quick Google search turns up no versions of this song by them…. But, yeah - perfect song for this! Last edited by GodelEscherDali on Thu Jun 20, 2019 10:40 am
Does anyone have info on the PROX-1 vehicle that releases Lightsail, and specifically its change in scope? It is substantially larger and heavier than Lightsail, includes thrusters, and its original mission was to release Lightsail, then rendezvous and orbit it, providing extra imagery and testing smallsat maneuvering. All that hardware is still being launched but AFAICT will no longer be *used*—recently, I read it was downscoped to simply release Lightsail and that’s it, and now this story doesn’t even name Prox-1, just calls it a “carrying case”. If that’s the situation, why even bother? Why not just launch Lightsail without PROX-1? And what happened with the original mission? I can’t find any reporting on that, not even on the PROX-1 official website at Georgia Tech.
Fuck Trump and his petty campaign to undo what Obama did.
#MakeAcidRainGreatAgain
Yeah lets just go back the 1950s... screw it.
at this point it doesnt matter, natural gas is more economical than coal by a long shot. the question is how do we go from natural gas, a major step up from coal, to renewable? dont say carban tax b/c that cant even pass in ca/wa, aint a national policy.
It is terrifying that a white man basically ran on a platform of undoing a black man’s legacy—while literally having none of the positive Presidential qualities of his predecessor, his primary opponents, or his own party’s predecessors—and two years in he still has a roughly ~40% approval rating solely for making good on that one promise. Trump is destroying everything Obama gave us, including international respect, a sustainable future, and hope.

Probably just like coal. We'll have to wait for the economics to change again. Most likely from when cheap gas stops being a thing more so than solar getting cheaper.
I get why coal is being propped up. But I don't get it. The numbers of people involved are so small. Like, of all the constituencies to pander to, what is it that makes this one so magical? Is the ""stick it to the hippie greens"" part really so big and important? Because the actual jobs at stake are just so miniscule.
How does the coal industry on its own have this level of political clout despite being small and shrinking? The whole thing feels like Politician A only panders to coal because Media Entity B says they're important which itself is only saying it because Media Entity C said so plus ""Murika!"" which itself is only saying it because Politician D said coal is important who them self only said so because Politician A did. The whole thing is just a giant fart and they're all tripping over each other to get the next huff while the world is starting to burn.
Or the 1850s. Poorhouses and coal fogs for everyone! For that matter, I get the sense that there are some people who haven't really gotten over the whole Enlightenment thing and would really prefer the 1650s.
It's not the numbers involved, it's all about the votes. Coal country is Trump country, so it gets a bailout. Farmers hurting? Bailout because they support Trump. Retailers? Screw 'em. They don't reliably vote Trump so no bailout despite losing multiples of coal jobs.
Heritage. Some areas, Appalachia especially, think of themselves as ""coal country"" and it's a big part of their self-identity. Then, some ""outsiders"" come by and say ""no no it's all wrong"". Most people don't react well to that, even if the actual number of directly-impacted people is small.
As others, i dont get how or why people even listen to coal lobby. What is the total revenue for all coal mining, production, power generation in the US every year? The economic impact is virtually nonexistent. I will guess yearly coal revenue from all sources less than a single week of revenue from Walmart or Amazon or even MS.
Hook up pipes to Covfefe's mouth and anus to collect ... freedom gas. Its daily output alone should be sufficient to power a small city. Include its hell spawns and members of its administration and we should be able to achieve energy independence in record time.
A lot of people base their political beliefs on a vision of America which is stuck in the past, fixated on a time when there really were a lot of jobs at stake in coal mines and steel mills. They forget how long ago that past actually was, pretending that ""their America"" existed just a few election cycles ago when in reality that America has been fading away for several decades.
It's pandering to donors not voters. Coal execs paid now they want to get paid. The ""Saving working class jobs"" is just press coverage that goes all too unexamined in the media. If the republicans cared about people in coal country they'd shut down the mines and fine the owners for the health care costs their operations leave former employees bearing.
Back in the 1950s the top marginal income tax rate was 90%+. Not totally bad actually...
1650's were lit AF.
To late, we have already gone back to mid-1930's Germany.
Conservatives keep saying how much they love the 1950s and want to make America like that again. But they hate the two things that helped make it possible. Higher taxes and higher union membership and through it, higher paying jobs.
For now. It won't be too much longer before he's replaced and he's made a shitty footnote in American history. He, and all of his congress critters... history won't be kind. It actually makes my heart feel good that I'll be alive to see all of his petty bullshit and jealousy reduced to rubble.
Intelligence follows a gaussian distribution - I suspect that a Venn diagram of low intelligence people and Trump supporters would be a nearly perfect circle...
Our institutions have to survive Trump, first.
Don't make the mistake of misunderestimating the stupidity and ignorance of the American electorate....
“Coal country” is meant as nostalgic appeal to working class whites, just like “Make America Great Again” is. Trump has occasionally also mentioned steel workers, and automotive manufacturing jobs. It evokes visions of people doing “honest work” for a living, and somehow supporting their families that way. Of course, most of those jobs are gone and aren’t coming back, but nostalgia isn’t about logic, it’s about feeling. But coal in particular allows you to simultaneously attack the regulatory state, which those same people are willing to blame for the loss of jobs (instead of, you know, globalism and liquid fossil fuels). So you get a two-fer there.
Following the great tradition as far as naming policies go, ""Affordable Clean Energy"" is neither affordable or clean, but it sure as hell is profitable to the right people.
Well, yeah, but I suspect it's mostly ""Fuck Obama and the libtards""

Some pairs of underpants you just have to toss in the trash. Fun fact: the word ""underpants"" is at least 15% funnier than ""underware"".
Another fun fact for those without underpants... Walking around naked in shoes feels more naked than being naked without shoes.
Part of it is politics, especially in places like West Virginia, which used to be Democratic and is now solidly Republican. But I think most of it is cultural. Coal and ""Drill, baby, drill!"" have become part of the Republican identity, at least partially because liberals hate it. Why do Trump supporters ""roll coal"" in their pickup trucks? It's not for economic reasons. It's just a sign of tribal identity. For that matter, why do coastal liberals brag about composting their garbage? It's not like that's going to save the world from global warming. It's all about either ""Love Mother Nature"" or ""Fuck Mother Nature"".
A lot of people have asked, and others have answered, but there are two big reasons coal is still a massively influential lobby, even while being one of the smallest industries in the US. First, and probably the single most important reason, is money. Not how much those coal companies make NOW, but how much they made when the industrial revolution started. Big Coal literally bought and paid for political lives, and Washington has a long institutional memory when it comes to who lines their pockets best. The second is a national memory, with some SERIOUSLY rose coloration on the glasses, about the ""good ol' days"" when the US was not a net importer of fuel, but THE exporter of fuel, specifically coal. Applicacia coal powered the latter half of the 19th century, and a fair portion of the first quarter of the 20th, and with that came money, at least to some people. A generation has passed since the last survivors of ""company scrip"" and the company store faded into obscurity, so we don't have the close, personal stories of WHY coal is bad for people, just the incredible stories of the Rockefeller's, Carnegie's, and Mellon's of the world, making money hand over fist because of coal and businesses around coal. Which leads back to reason one, political money. Even today, with the coal industry employing only about 50 THOUSAND people, across the ENTIRE US, Big Coal spends a very large amount of money lobbying, and that money talks across the centuries. https://datausa.io/profile/naics/coal-mining
It's virtually guaranteed that there won't be a peaceful transition of power in 2021 if he loses, especially given how he's been amping up the ""2nd amendment types"" in his violently loyal base and how he's been talking up extra terms for himself. But then even more wild shit could happen between now and then, we've got 18 months for Trump and his toadies to shit on the country (especially given that he'll apparently get a pass on his criminality from Pelosi and McConnell.)
Only replying to you because you were the most recent comment on the issue. The ACE rule is more about coal power plants rather than coal mining, right? Are there any numbers on how many people power production with coal employs? Genuinely asking, no ulterior motive.
Technically coal, natural gas, oil are all renewable. It just takes a heck of a long time.
If I read that correctly, the CPP was never actually implemented so, while I understand the comparison of ACE to CPP, what is the comparison of ACE to what the actual status quo is right now? Obviously I don't expect this administrations EPA to actually do it's job, but is this actually actively making things worse (which is my expectation) or is this a slight improvement (while also being a massive handout to coal)?
It's hard to fight a revolution from a mobility scooter. The south is too fat to rise again.
Don't worry, it's clean coal /s
Well, AIUI it does provide an incentive to invest in keeping the old plants in operation for longer instead of using that investment for cleaner options, so...
I would think if anything, the odds of them having the ""right number"" of people for a good statistical chance of success, would be low. Not like they would have had the chance to run experiments and know what that number was. For that matter, I suspect that coming in with too many people, then having half of them die, would look about the same from our modern genetic perspective as them arriving with half as many people to start with.
Most of the first places people occupied there are probably underwater now, given the changes in sea level. So, the evidences are probably gone forever 🙁
A dingo and a wombat had a baby, obviously a dingbat, which posts on ars as dogwitch.....
They did not die out does not mean they had good odds to start with. Also the model assumes they were hunter-gatherers when there is growing evidence to contradict this as the only part of their lifestyles - it is more regional dependent. An optimal solution is really only optimal if you get to play more than once - say playing CIV. For a real life chance for this we may see multiple colonization attempts of our Moon and Mars to try and establish a permanent human presence. As for the Australian Aboriginals they managed to survive in a large variety of areas in Australia and thrive in some too. Having worked in the Outback it is an impressive feat to think what they achieved.
It required technology (boats or rafts) to get to an island, but the reward was a new land with wildlife that had never seen humans before (and had no fear), plus unexploited plants and shellfish beds. Australia was the biggest island of all. It was a bonanza, at least for the first few centuries before the large land marsupials were hunted to extinction. The ancestral Aborigines were involved in one of the earliest and largest high-tech booms in human history.
I'd almost say that 130 people every 70 to 90 years might even be on the low side, with the continent seeming like everything, up to and including the grass and many of the rocks, seem to be poisonous, dangerous and/or lethal to humans in some way.

Did you miss the part about sea levels 100 meters lower? Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory_of_Australia puts the crossing as potentially only 90 km.
""How many people did it take to colonize Australia?"" Would depend on assumptions about the frequency of negative dingo/baby interactions.
Have Australia's aboriginal people retained any boat making skills? I know it's a long time, but it seems weird to me that a people skilled addy seafaring would give up the seafaring (not saying it's unlikely or implausible, it just intuitively feels like the kind of thing you wouldn't abandon).
The Tasmanians lost boat-building and IIRC were still paleolithic when they were discovered and wiped out by Europeans. Their population was too small to have retained that knowledge and they were too far offshore for mainland Aborigines to be in contact.
This is an interesting hypothetical question, raised in the article, but we start from the certain knowledge that the colonization was successful. I imagine that implications relate to how we research the likely migration paths, and think about what sorts of evidence (in what amounts) we need to look for.
The first people to arrive would have encountered mega fauna which were not familiar with pack hunting humans. These large marsupials, flightless birds and reptiles would have been relatively easy prey. In particular, Meiolania, a giant land turtle, would have made for quite a feast. With no other human or placental mammal competition (dogs, aka dingos didn't arrive until later), the first humans should have had an easy life and rapidly increased in numbers. Let me emphasize, when the first humans reached Australia, there were zero placental mammal predators. The dingo (dog) was not present. It was brought to Australia some 10,000 years later. The top large predators were giant monitor lizards (including the Komodo Dragon) one of which was 23 feet long, 16 foot long land crocodiles, 500 pound flightless carnivorous birds, and a 300 pound marsupial ""tiger"". The plant eating animals included, but not limited to a giant 500 pound kangaroo, a three ton wombat, a 500 pound land turtle which had a club tail, a sheep size monotreme, and a 1,000 pound ""thunder"" bird. Although these sound scary, they were dumb and slow. They would have all been relatively easy prey for the first humans. In contrast the animals in North America were modern placentals with speed and brains. (Lions, saber toothed cats, bears, wolves) I think just a small group of castaway humans would have done well. Others probably followed, but for the first humans it would have been a hunter gatherer dream time. Last edited by DaleL on Wed Jun 19, 2019 8:06 pm
Australia http://arhv.anmm.gov.au/people/11358 Papua New Guinea https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakatoi The migration across the Pacific covered journeys of thousands of kilometres, so 90km is a stone's throw by comparison. Granted the timeframes and level of technological sophistication may be different.
Have you heard of Thor Heyerdahl and the Kon-Tiki expedition? They did 4300 miles (6900 km) on a balsa wood raft - just to prove that South Americans could have populated the Polynesian islands.
Naw, when the Aboriginals arrived, most of the animals were large, tasty, and not sufficiently wary. Those ones got eaten; and now the continent only has left those which are toxic, angry, poisonous, fast moving or all four.. Australia: everything here wants to kill you; because the ones that weren't as aggressive got eaten. (I have heard a similar process has happened in the Cook Islands - all the reef fish around the main islands are poisonous and the fish for eating are caught on outer islands or in the open ocean; because the islands have been inhabited long enough for the tasty local fish to have all been eaten)
I'm assuming that the sharks back then would have been as hungry and aggressive as the ones encountered and recounted by sailors and pilots during the Pacific war. For a migration, I'll imagine some sturdy boats were used.
And in reality, the first people probably arrived by accident, and the next people probably arrived by accident, and at some point, someone made it back the other direction and set up a trade network. After that, you'd have professional traders making the journey, bringing along a few other people each time, possibly in both directions. There'd probably be a few times when the few traders all got wiped out, resulting in extended periods of no travel, followed by someone who figures it out again and meets up with these other people groups. I know these are hunter/gatherer groups, but people have been trading things for a long time too. As a result, the first people to settle New Guinea probably didn't survive -- but knowledge of the things to hunt and gather there did. So larger parties would be sent out, and some of them wouldn't come back. There'd be trade of both goods and of people in both directions. Once a stable population was established in New Guinea, it would have started foraging and expanding in the direction of Australia, eventually circumnavigating the continent, with the aid of supplies from the New Guinea settlement areas.
The emu war has raged for millenia.
The Kon-Tiki expedition crossed 4,300 miles of the Pacific on a raft. The same man also crossed 4000 miles of the Atlantic on a raft.
Why assume people were stupid then? If your people lived on a rather small island then THE tech of the day is ""Boating"".
There is evidence of lightweight canoes made of bark over a wooden frame in use before the 17th century and dugout canoes replacing them after the 17th century. There is no evidence of continuous seafaring but the number of finds from the deep past is low that really doesn't mean anything.
It's really not that bad. There are some very poisonous snakes but we're too big to eat so they stay away from us. Crocodiles are a genuine threat but only in water. On land humans can sprint a faster than the crocodiles found in Australia, and we can maintain our speed over much longer distances. Give the human a weapon, such as a sharpened stick, and the crocodile will have to run for its life. Some plants are poisonous if you eat them. But our taste buds detect the danger and they're disgusting. Some of them can be processed, which both removes the toxins and the bad taste. That's about it really for threats to humans. The apex predator on land is the dingo. They're intelligent enough to recognise how dangerous humans are and avoid us. If you corner a dingo and force it into a fight they're likely to surrender - in the canine equivalent of raising a white flag. Lay down, head on the ground, stay still, hope you go away. Living among dingos on the mainland, you only ever come across them while travelling at high speed in a car and only briefly before they run off. You might wake up every morning and find your house surrounded by their footprints, but you'll almost never see them. I've only seen them regularly on a small island off shore which was packed with tourists and they'd learned we just want to take a photo. Those mostly dingos ignored humans the way a bird in your backyard will do. Last edited by Abhi Beckert on Wed Jun 19, 2019 5:39 pm
lol @ that jokey ass headline. You also have to say it with the Aussie accent.
Quote: That left just a 10% chance of extinction after 100 generations 100 generations! That sounded extremely impressive, until I remembered: Quote: People have lived in Australia and New Guinea since at least 60,000 years ago Suddenly 100 generations seems woefully insufficient; shouldn't they be modeling a few thousand generations? Or is the risky period just at the beginning? In any case, the consideration of thousands of generations just illustrates how mind-boggling long these time spans are. Compared to the way people lived for the same way for so long, our modern world is just a blink of an eye. Quote: According to the model, if a new group of about 130 people arrived every 70 to 90 years Can you imagine a new wave of settlers being the big event, not even every lifetime, but every few lifetimes? Your grandparents telling stories about that time, when they were young, when new people showed up?
Thanks for that. I think people greatly underestimate the capabilities of the people at that time. Thor Heyerdahl had access to a huge trove of information (like the fact that there actually IS land at the other end of the voyage). I am not saying it couldn't possibly have been a raft but I contend is vanishingly unlikely. I challenge any of you to build a raft big enough to colonize another land mass and convince people to join you and jump onto a raft going out to sea, remembering that in a raft there IS NO WAY TO RETURN. The Polynesians were centuries ahead of the west in terms of ocean going tech but that was still less than 2 thousand years ago. But we are talking about a culture from at least 60 thousand years ago. I've been on the ocean out where you can't see land. With engine trouble. It is amazingly scary. These folks had balls of steel even if they had mastered boats. I just don't think its very likely at all that they crossed ~50 miles of extremely treacherous water with enough people and supplies to start a colony in a one way raft.
Seems like an awful lot of guesswork and surprised to see so many logic jumps.

Even if the chance of success for each attempt is very small, given a very large number of tries (whether intentional or not...), eventually you'd expect to see a group make it. Whether the large number here (thousands or tens of thousands of years) compensates for each raft's poor odds, I have no idea, but it seems possible. Even for the Polynesians I would expect there to be many, many deaths for each successful voyage into the unknown. Any successful colonization event must have been exceedingly rare in the course of countless ordinary lifetimes lived.
If you have a small group and not all of them know some skill, the odds of that skill vanishing are quite big. Imagine a group where 10% know how to make a boat. They reach a new land and, for some reason, they don't need to return to the sea. After all, Australia+New Guinea are huuuge and plentiful, enough for you to lose interest on sea traveling. Those 10% pass their knowledge to some of the new generation, say 5%, but they don't have the need to put it to practice or don't care. Some knowledge is lost during that transmission (think how hard it is to really learn a skill and how it easy to lose it without practice). Repeat this for some generations and puf, that knowledge is gone. I'm not saying this happened here, I don't know, but it's not hard to imagine it happening. As someone above said, the Tasmanian people didn't have that kind of technology when Europeans got there but their ancestors obviously had it. How did they lost that knowledge? Somewhere along the way, a small, isolated community, generation after generation, lost the skills it didn't need until it's too late and no one else in the group had the know-how. Kind of a tragic, slow-motion ""Idiocracy"" that utimately put them at the mercy of other, more advanced groups. Or extinct. Last edited by SuinusLatinus on Wed Jun 19, 2019 5:58 pm
Convicts and Outlaws? ""You can move to that new place or we will cut your head off!"" Then there are always some who just can't obey the law and set out for the frontiers. Wouldn't be very hard to find 150 people like that every century.

Exactly. Don't assume migration is the result of a positive thought process. Think about the USA, how many groups came here out of duress, or because they were forced to? Those folks on New Guinea may have lost a war, failed to please the right chieftain, had the wrong religion or any number of unfortunate circumstances. So, it's off to the boats... ""Hey, I remember a story about an island to the south...""
The local equivalent of the Cylons shows up and the next thing you know, you're part of a rag-tag fleet looking for the lost 13th colony...
It is incredibly difficult to compare relatively recent, well understood cultures with the oldest living human culture in the world. 60,000+ years is a long time!
I don't understand the reasoning it must have been an organized massive migration (or a series of organized large migrations). If they had boats (which they must have had), I don't see why this event wasn't just a gradual expansion of a island hopping people's range, until they hit Sahul. There's nothing stopping the first few families landing on the coast from maintaining contact with the closest islands for trade, new mates, etc.
Oh goody. I can't wait for water wars to erupt between India, Bangledesh, pakistan, nepal, et al. But fake news right?
Time lapse photography is very good at showing how serious the issue really is. The one that really gets me is the polar sea ice time lapse from about 1980 onward: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8auMIfF50Ng
More unfortunate(ly expected) news. I can sometimes understand climate denialism - in the ""La la la, I can't hear you!"" category of reactions to bad news. I'm pretty sure, though, that reaction has never made said bad thing actually abate - or violate causality and not happen in the first place. So, while there is little we can do on an individual level, if I may quote Bill Nye: ""Vote!""

That sounds suspiciously snarky.....
Every individual contribution counts: 1. Get a 100% renewable power plan 2. Make your home energy efficient (solar screens, LED lighting, electric appliances) 3. Whatever you can afford: EV, hybrid, high MPG vehicle, or no vehicle if possible 4. Vote! 5. Eat more appropriately, like don’t get in a situation where you are throwing half your fold away. I just contracted for solar panels for my home at a net $2/W installed. In a few years, maybe will get another 8 kW of panels to charge a 30 kWHr battery for the evening hrs. In 5 years, it might be affordable. In another 5 years, the gas heater will be replaced by a electric heat pump.
We are so fucked. Come to think of it, why did I just have a kid? She’s going to inherit a fucking fireball for a planet. I hate humans. We are such a plight on this planet.
In addition to everything we can do that we KNOW can slow or halt warming, we really need a Manhattan Project for desalinization.
And the Yangtze, Mekong, Sahween, Irrawaddy, and who knows what else. All these billions of people are all going to Siberia to enjoy the beautiful northern arctic shores. Nobody will have a problem with that I’m sure.
Don't forget the increasingly horrible and lethal heatwaves which a lot of predictions are beginning to say will make parts of the Indian subcontinent literally unlivable during parts of the year. Or that China took over the Tibet region because of its strategic importance, such as being the source of so many rivers running through the region. Or that India is due to surpass China in population within the next few years. Oh, and nukes. Cannot forget those. Fun times.
Those would be, what? Mole-men?
So... assuming the trend is exponential (or however a curve through the values lines up)... How long is it before the seasonal runoff starts to decline instead of increase? How many years are we talking about here? We saw 13% in non-renewable runoff over the first 25 years, followed by a rise to 15% increase in non-renewable runoff over the next *16* years. When this number starts going down instead of up, it's going to affect food supplies and living conditions. And when it starts going down, that means it won't be long (in decades) until it essentially runs out.
A few hundred million South Asians will run out of potable drinking water over the next decade. The imminent climate refugee exodus will make the Syrian refugee crisis look like a cakewalk. We live in interesting times. Last edited by arcite on Wed Jun 19, 2019 4:25 pm
Its our drive. Try to raise them right to do more than we've done. I do what I can. I am hoping my kids do better. Maybe my kids will discover a reasonable carbon capture system or a way to filter CO2 out of the atmosphere effectively enough to implement.
I’m convinced that these clowns that say global warming really are un-reachable morons or have some kind of ulterior motive.
I think he was getting at the point that the decisions that started, perpetuate, and refuse to meaningfully address global warming lie with actors whose power extends to national, regional, and global reach, not necessarily with individual humans making personal decisions.

This is, kinda, ""nothing"". I mean, yeah, it's horrific, but on a time-line scale, it's fast, and accelerating. So, why do I say it's kinda ""nothing""? The permafrost in Canada is melting. Everyone knows this. But the rate over the last five years has seen an extent of melting that wasn't expected for another 70 years. Everyone knows about melting glaciers. Permafrost is, potentially, much more dangerous when it melts. The organic materials, no longer frozen, begin to decay, and that releases huge amounts of Methane. Though methane doesn't stay in the atmosphere as long as CO2, it's a considerably more potent greenhouse gas with respect to how much heating it does. The glaciers melting is not anything to be considered as anything but horrible, but comparatively speaking, people should be pissing themselves over the extent of the melt of the permafrost. That's only going to make things considerably worse than the heating not having glaciers to reflect the sun's energy will have (and the water shortages certain to come). And then there's this, at a time when emissions from the U.S. are rising again. Just a god-awful week of news for the planet...
We are deeply fucked indeed, people seem to be less aware and believe more in nonsense.
The United States voted in as President a man who promised them that he would wind back every attempt to combat climate change. Australia is where I live. A few weeks ago we voted these people back in to power , despite years of drought, cyclones, reef bleaching, and record heatwaves: We are the problem. Edit for labels: The man holding the coal is the Prime Minister (Morrison), who has appointed the head of the mining association as his chief of staff. They're also the people who helpfully polished that piece of coal. The red-faced man was the Deputy Prime Minister (Joyce), who resigned after having a baby with a staffer. The other laughing man was the Defence Minister (Pyne), who left Parliament to work in the private sector. The bemused man at the front is the former Prime Minister (Turnbull), who was forced to resign by his party because he tried to pass legislation to cut emissions from coal.
If Australia moderated its use and sale of coal, it would be too late to stop lots of those dark-skinned climate refugees from screwing up the Aussutopia. If they do not moderate coal burning, all of Australia will be on fire, and said dark-skinned refugees will be looking to go elsewhere. Brilliant!
Maybe we just classify the small to medium scale nuclear exchange as a 'geoengineering' effort aimed at counteracting damaging increases in surface temperature due to climate change and call it even?
You say that until the Mariner of Nepal arrives!
Chinese conspiracy. I heard people say that.

They are artificially watering the entire south of france today already. I somehow doubt we'll be interested in pakistan or india in a couple centuries. Not saying that those countries won't run out of water too. My doomsday scenario doesnt involve wars, it involves massive migration and a complete loss of respect for the value of ¹human life, including lots of regional conflicts and genocide similar to the mayan civilization.
Off topic, but... Those KH-9 Big Birds were designed in the 60's. They were film, not digital. These Roof of World images did not come cheap, someone really wanted them. Or wanted parts unseen. A moderately wide-angle lens, and resolution of only 60 cm. Still, good enough for ponies. What were NSA looking for? How'd they get declassified? And why now? One might imagine it was for precisely this purpose -- US Defense Department is highly aware the national security risk posed by climate change, and this study certainly aids that understanding. But they could probably have done it themselves, in house, and no one would have been the wiser. Apparently they want it public.
It's an inside joke. Climate change discussions tend to get derailed by denialist trolls. I guess at some point people just got fed up with it and started posting pictures of ponies. First page of the thread is definitely too early for ponies though.
Because we have to hope and try even when things look hopeless. If we don't at least hope and try then there is no chance of a ""miracle"" happening at all. Better some chance than no chance.
That’s obnoxious, though. We’re still page one, not one troll in sight yet, and interesting contributions. And yet half the thread is already a tedious off-topic about ponies...

Babel Fish ?
Gefilte fish?
I must agree with thornburg, that vid is very weak evidence. I have seen more compelling evidence of toy fish ""swimming"" in the tub after toddlers gave them a decent push.
Yeah, I saw some twitching, but I couldn't be sure it was the fish moving, or someone cutting the hand that just moved it out of the video. A longer, maybe time-lapse video would much better demonstrate the concept.
Make it Internet of Things connected, and it can be Super Fish.
However impractical or riddled with design flaws this ended up being... it's a robot fish with electro-blood. Awesome.
Did the fish even move in the video?!
That's just frickin' awesome. No, I don't have a use for that right now. But solving a whole bunch of problems in a novel way makes us think about things differently. They're going to go places. Probably slowly, but they'll go places.
This ends with the 12 colonies getting nuked by toasters. Again.
Yes, but just barely. You have to watch it a few (dozen) times to see the movement. The tail does twitch by a couple of millimeters. And the fish definitely moves forward.
I'd been thinking something similar before getting to this paragraph, and that got me musing about the absolutely spectactular energy efficiency of living creatures. And then you look at how poorly this thing performs in comparison to an actual fish, and you get a bit of an idea of just how far we still have to go.
While I don't disagree with your last statement, I will point out that the fish doesn't have to carry its oxidizer or its reacted chemicals with it.

Synthetic sushi?
iSushi

How far we still have to go where? I think this is a proof of concept for the feasibility of energy generation by means of fluid displacement rather than an attempt to build an optimally designed fish.
emphasis added ""Attempt to build an optimally designed fish"" sounds like a fantastic assignment for engineering students. Or marine biology students. Or bio-engineering students. I'd watch a ""reality TV"" show of that competition.

So, is this filling and emptying bladders? I can picture a flat bladder with the battery parts laying in it, but how do you circulate the stored fluids through the battery?
The electrical power is needed to move the fluid form one bladder to another to enable swimming. And, fortuitously enough, that's exactly when the fluid leaving one bladder can pass over the electrodes on the way to the other bladder.
If they get out of hand, robotic cats can be created to hunt those down!
""...its reacted chemicals with it."" Wait. Are you telling me fish poop? In what they are swimming in? Ewwwww. :-P
I was more thinking of the CO2 that comes out of the gills. But yeah, poop too.
In principle at least, neither does the robot.
Sure it does. All the chemicals needed for the before- and after- the ion transport liberates electrical energy are stored in the fluid. The robot is not an air battery that takes in oxygen from the atmosphere to participate in the reaction. When you eat you take in carbon and hydrogen molecules that form fuel, but the oxidizer comes in as needed and the exhaust products (CO2 and H2O) are rejected.

Makes sense except that the article states that fluid is stored in the dorsal fins also. I suppose fluid between bladders could loop through the dorsal fins.

Though I'm fascinated by technological breakthroughs across disciplines and consider myself something of a science nerd, there are times when I just want to retire into the woods on a mountain somewhere. As much as there is huge potential to the future of science, there are some damn scary scenarios that could pretty much wipe out life, at least human life, on the planet.
I think a better stock photo of a 'scientist doing DNA science' would be a disconsolate graduate student looking at yet another failed PCR reaction. (More seriously, congrats on getting an article from Church. He sent me one of his excellent E.coli knockout vectors many years ago).
Very interesting read, and on a topic I really hadn't considered much. I appreciate the author mentioning the privacy concerns related to such a massive sensor network, because that was pretty much my number one concern after the first paragraph. Setting up something like what the author describes would be a pretty major balancing act between public safety and privacy. My major concern is really a slippery slope concern - the more surveillance data you have, the more it can be mis-used. I would want to see a clear outline for how privacy is addressed as a cornerstone of any implementation plan, to say the least.
Oh, great, when's the biological equivalent of the Vault 7 leak scheduled? I'm sure nothing regrettable will come of this.
Wow, I wish I could sweep away all the ethical concerns in my field of research that easily - and I don't work in genetics or biology.
Sorry, I don't see that statement as ""sweeping away all the ethical concerns"" but rather recognizing that there are legitimate privacy concerns as well as legitimate societal benefits and they have to be weighed accordingly. Isn't that a fairly adult approach to take?
One thing that is a virtual inevitability is ""Disease X"". It's the next big pandemic, against which we will have little or no natural immunity. The World Health Organization lists it in the top ten disease threats facing us as climate change makes its mark. And that mark is being made even faster in some places than ever thought possible. As ice sheets melt, diseases and pathogens from before modern man walked the earth are going to be released. As the environment changes, new regions, and victims, become available in which rapidly mutating bugs can thrive. It's a nightmare scenario in a lot of ways because a disease can take down a civilization almost as fast as a global nuclear exchange. The one thing operating against that is time. That's the time it takes to find out what it is, how to kill it, manufacture a cure or treatment AND get that cure or treatment out there in amounts sufficient to keep panic from becoming rioting and destruction. This kind of idea is a necessary first step in the identification of a new, unknown pathogen. What is it is always the first step. The rest may, or may not, follow, depending on the ""what is it"" part, but the resources and procedures MUST be in place as well to deal with a new (or old) pandemic should it be found in that first step. As an aid to advancing the understanding of technology and sharing knowledge, civilization is among the best ways of doing that. But it is very hard on people (the life span of humans went DOWN when we moved from hunter/gatherer (40 or so) to farmer and ""civilization"" that followed (20-35, depending on region), and didn't come back up globally until the early to mid 20th century when modern antibiotics and medicine became a thing). The conditions of being in close proximity to other people facilitates the spread of disease. Just look at how the clusters of measles have formed for that. All of them are in relatively dense urban settings. Having the procedures and the tools in place, and available, to combat this threat is key to preventing the spread of diseases in the first place. But getting people to get on board with preventative measures is next to impossible. With governments being untrusted these days, and with the levels of paranoid thinking we have all over the world, we probably won't do enough to prevent the spread of a new epidemic, let alone stop it. The disagreements in the few posts here in this discussion thread show why stalemate on the issue is likely. If more people realized we're in this for the survival of the species, it seems to me that much of the excuses we have to maintain our ""personal privacy"" will be rendered moot. The globe on which we live is changing. We can't be expected to maintain our lifestyles and survive those changes. And I say this as an intensely private individual. Your privacy and lifestyle or your life, and the lives of everyone you know. Seems like simple math to me. YMMV, and if it does, that'll be why mankind will not survive for much longer.
When the 900 lb gorilla in the room is the privacy implications of your suggestion you have to give it more than a passing sentence that those concerns should be ""properly contextualized."" And when the next sentence begins ""One potential precedent is our regulation of driving"" you can see that the author has already put enough context on the issue for himself and is ready to move on at full speed. Of course, what could possibly go wrong with massive databases of everyone genetic code?

Oh wait, the history of information is literally the exploitation and abuse of such information. Yeah, one passing sentence to begrudgingly admit that not everyone is as gung-ho about disclosing every last possible minute detail of their genome to the world is brushing the issue under the rug.

In a normal, pre-Trumpian society, that sort of debate was normal. To have a public debate about ethics requires everyone to negotiate in good faith. The author has already clearly placed his concern for public privacy at the level of DMV licensing. Even when I disagree with people in my own field about possible safety considerations, I still value their input. This person, clearly has no interest in an informed, honest discussion on the topic. He's fixated on global genetic surveillance. But to put a single off-hand remark dismissing those concerns into a position piece like this solidly plants him as a fanatic. And I'm not interested in the positions of extremists or fanatics on any issue. Your opinion may differ. That's the great thing about opinions - everyone's entitled to their own.
It's reasonable but also only the briefest of glances at what might be inside Pandora's box. The privacy implications and potential for abuse (for eugenics or genocide, say) are vast and interesting so it's bizarre to me that it's given so little attention. The consensus of the medical community might generally be trustworthy and altruistic but they work under governments, AKA people who have a lot of guns. Once such a system is installed, its eventual use for human rights abuses is arguably inevitable. I don't know what becomes of ethics in the face of a worldwide plague but it's certainly worth talking about.

If you do, then you 're subject to the said regulations. You don't have this option when it comes to your genome, so yes, it is a really lousy analogy. It's really troubling for a prominent scientist to handwave serious questions on ethics so lightly. Yet, he's dead right about the need of a surveillance mechanism. It's ethically sound and, as far as I 've read, realistic.
Ok that image has got to be a joke
Lost me at ""DNA Surveillance.""
FWIW, there are ways that one could address some of the privacy concerns. A detection network as Prof. Church is proposing would probably focus on non-human DNA sequences - viruses, bacteria, and the like. One could imagine either filtering out human DNA (based on length) or informationally filtering (compare to the human genome and discard). Still, the infrastructure could absolutely be used for nefarious purposes. One real challenge (not discussed explicitly) is to detect novel pathogens. Other than the laborious steps of culturing and testing the entire organism, it's difficult to assess the safety of a novel organism based on gazing at its genome. Some microbes also resist attempts to culture them. This makes it very difficult to study the associated diseases. For example, we cannot nail down the bacterium responsible for Citrus Greening Disease because it cannot be cultured. This creates significant difficulties for scientific study and development of treatment.

""To make a DNA-sensitive threat-detection network viable, we'd first need a more equitable distribution of medical technologies across the world, especially when it comes to DNA surveillance. Three of the most low-cost and highly effective global public health strategies are hygiene, quarantine, and vaccines."" And therein lies the catch. We don't have anything even vaguely like an equitable distribution of medical technologies across the world. If we did, the need for the system Church proposes would be greatly reduced. Most (if not all) new pandemics emerge from dirt-poor African and Asian regions where overcrowding, lack of basic healthcare and public health services, people living in too close proximity with farm or wild animals, and even people eating primates (shudder) all combine to make them stewpots for the evolution of new pandemics. And meanwhile, back in the developed world, increasing numbers of well-educated people who should know better are shunning life-saving vaccines and even questioning basic principles of hygiene (such as washing your hands after using the restroom). Personally, I think the money it would cost to develop, put in place, and operate the proposed surveillance network would be more effectively spent bringing medical care and public health programs to the developing world, plus fighting developed-world science-deniers.
Sorry, I don't want my fundamental human, inalienable, rights...contextualized.
Could somebody please explain what ""real time"" means here. What is changing in time that the device needs to keep up with?
As opposed to previously being on the weeks timescale perhaps.
The problem I have with all this is how we recognise what is a pathogen and what isn't. It's not a simple matter of doing a DNA scan and a true/false value popping out the far end. It's analogous to self-driving cars recognising hazards on the road ahead. Or, perhaps, a computer virus scanner. For existing pathogens, there may be some fingerprint that can be detected. But new strains won't match.
Sad that the potential of synbio is overlooked while AI aka ""glorified curve fitting"" gets hyped out of proportion.
I'm of the opinion that an engineered pathogen capable of ended all human life is not only possible, but extremely likely to be created and very likely to be released with 100 years. People tend to think of viruses, and assume that there will be some pockets of humanity left after most everyone else has died. An engineered pathogen could be far more ... thorough. Consider a strain of bacteria that's perfectly capable of thriving in regular garden soil, yet produces an array of different toxins, any one of which is capable of killing a human. Add immunity to every known antibiotic. Anything grown in soil harboring this bacteria would be deadly. Anything just coming into contact with the soil would potentially spread it. Now seed it across the globe with nothing more elaborate than one person in a private airplane. That is just one of a thousand different scenarios for which the best outcome is that it merely ends modern civilization. That's the risk. That the ability to create such a world destroying super-bug is in the hands of any halfway competent grad-student. How do we defend against that risk as it emerges (and is already emerging)? Best act quickly. And oh, no privacy loss allowed, because that is clearly off the table, right? Right?
I guess if humans are a cancer on the planet, this would be a good thing, right? -------- I originally just came here to say I love that artist's impression!

As I see it, the author is clearly aware of the huge civil liberties and privacy issues, but wanted to focus this article on the more technical aspects of this topic. Adding in a discussion on the privacy aspects would have overshadowed the tech. That said, the privacy aspects are definitely worth exploring. As shown in the article, the technology is (nearly) there for ubiquitous dna surveillance. And if history teaches anything, it will be used. What we can try to choose is how, by whom, and for what purposes it will be used. And when discussing ubiquitous surveillance, keep in mind that there are already several technologies in wide deployments that can and are being used for such surveillance. Many/most of us carry around a radio enabled communications device that as part of it’s basic function needs to track your location. And (security) cameras are everywhere, which combined with the current state of facial recognition can do a good job of tracking people. Voice recognition could probably do a pretty good job too, and I’m sure there are other technologies that I haven’t thought of right now. Given that, it seems to me that it is more worthwhile to discuss privacy and civil liberties in a broader context, independent of specific technologies. It deserves its own articles and discussions, which will no doubt include people complaining that they want to focus on the tech instead.
Sorry, having the wrong people in power destroys any chance of this ever happening. The question of what evil people do when given power is answered throughout history and this would be an unprecedented level of power. The idea of specifically targeting an entire sector of a population based on their genetics would be FAR too high at this point in Humanity's evolution. This could even be seen as a giant step towards accepting eugenics and that field, in both practice and fiction, literally sees genocide of certain genes as the end goal...when considering our complete lack of understanding on how our genes directly influence how we think at this stage of our scientific growth, talking about this as a real idea is dangerous. All it takes is 1 insane person with power talking about their superior genes being their reason for success and then taking that 1 step further...doesn't sound like the current U.S. Asshole-in-Chief at all.
The ONLY way this would have a CHANCE of happening is if Doctors cure something like Ebola by using a gene-splicer to kill the virus by deleting the DNA and no adverse effects occur. Notice how i said ""cure"", no Vaccinate, not treat, but CURE. And then it would only lead to people willing to have their DNA stored on file IF THEY OPT IN. The only way this happens is if we survive a global plague level bug of our own and even then, after the worse is done, people will fight against this level of invasion. If not because of our own stubborn nature, but because those like myself would fight against storing anything related to the DNA of non-Criminals with the citizens name. The level of power is even described as a ""superpower"" by the author of the article, which means we are handing over something that in the wrong hands has the power to directly target sections of the population with a genetic virus...or, in good hands, someone who could release a ""no-cancer"" airborne gene splicer that has zero negative effects for free, thus curing cancer and killing all the companies that rely on Cancer Treatments to survive (Treatment is more profitable than a cure, and companies will never cure something that is not DIRECTLY CONTAGIOUS and Deadly). This is a case where we need to just accept treatment because the cure in this case has an unacceptable mortality rate. Unless you think any nation with the mindset of the Nazis would not abuse this knowledge, you should not preach it or you better have a good argument for why the Nazi's having this information would not be a big deal...

We are having a debate here and his response had NOTHING to do with the placement, but with the potential WEIGHT of the abuses that could occur. The author ONLY discusses how beneficial this could be; he then links to another one of his papers as his primary defense while equating 'information which in the wrong hands could lead to Global Genocide of Humanity' to driving a car...and he did that for an article on a site that is much better known for having more informed and critical thinking people visit it than layman. I can clearly see how beneficial this could be, as do almost all of us who are against this on more than just Privacy concerns, but those defending the idea, as well as the author themselves, are leaving out incredibly relevant information. Like how an evil person could use this information to create a super-virus that would almost definitely morph to kill everyone because any virus that is designed to kill a large portion of the population would almost have to mutate to kill everyone since many in that population have genes that are in most other people. If you create a virus to kill 1 million specific people, do you really believe that ""1 in a million chance"" of the virus mutating would not happen? You are leaving out the huge negative while boasting about the huge positive...that is disingenuous and exactly to be expected in this time of mis-information. So you are the proverbial kettle here.

Agreed! Besides, that looks a lot like the Trivago guy in the photo?
SLS delayed? Money continuing to be thrown down the drain for SLS? I'm shocked, totally shocked to read this...
I am usually impressed with the GAO -- they seem to give straightforward reports that don't attempt to obfuscate the truth. Unfortunately, they are also like the old toothless dog. The GAO can issue reports to kingdom come, but it doesn't ever change anything either.
When it comes to the GAO I actually find them to be optimistic, about forward progress of such things. if the GAo says 2021 is more likely, then I figure end of 2021 mid 2022 to be realistic. if nothing else goes wrong. Since they are build a a state of the art rocket using spare parts from over stock created 20 years ago, I expect things to go wrong.
Who is running this show? How can they not get this completed? Space X and others have almost mastered recoverable rockets in the time it has taken to not get SLS.
Clock set. Thank you.
It makes more sense when you view it as having a primary purpose of being a jobs program for parts of Alabama, courtesy of Senator Richard Shelby.
It's okay guys no need to worry about favoritism, the report forgot to mention that Boeing told NASA the rocket would be ""super duper awesome"" when finished.
It's getting closer. In only five years, they've managed to bring the launch date from N+4 to N+2. With any luck and five more years of funding they can get the launch date to N+1.
They can't build a disposable launch vehicle in the time frame it takes SpaceX to revolutionize the entire industry with reusable rockets. There isn't even anything about the SLS that is particularly exotic or challenging. The entire design is low hanging technological fruit.
Aren’t we already well into worst-case schedule outcome at this point given that it is mid 2019 and the first launch isn’t until 2020/21 at current projections... when it was targeted for 2017? ...and that is for a Frankenstein rocket that was meant to reuse existing technology to save money and time. (At least that is how they framed it but we all know that making a functional rocket via this program is only a side goal at this point thanks to a feww congress critters.)

Boeing has to make up for its losses on 737 MAX somehow.
XKCD should do a JWST-style projection for the first SLS launch.
I'm thinking that artists rendition of the SLS should have Shelby's face in place of the NASA logo. You know, truth in advertising and all that. Provided they ever get the SLS to the point where they have something worth painting that is.
""NASA now estimates that it will spend about $10 billion to develop the rocket and associated ground systems at Kennedy Space Center, where the vehicle will launch from."" While wikipedia (yes, I know it's not a perfect source) shows 14 billion as already being spent. Is this like controlled fusion where in only 10 billion more dollars we will have it. edit: and we keep adding $10 billion more each year...... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Lau ... nd_funding Last edited by Z06 Vette on Wed Jun 19, 2019 10:28 am
Yeah, it's really a shame too, because they seem to be staffed with top-tier people who know their material like the back of their hand. But given the current political climate, with anything that does not fit the current administration's narrative being decried as Fake News, among other things, this is just par for the course (whose scorecard was cheated on). There is simply too much cultural and bureaucratic inertia to escape from. Coupled with it being spread across so many congressional districts and saddled with administration that is too busy bitching incoherently like a sundowning grandpa on Twitter to do much of anything effect, small wonder this project isn't doing so well.
Quote: ""The GAO report repeatedly projects the worst-case schedule outcome,"" Gerstenmaier wrote in a letter to the GAO. Quote: Boeing was focused on minimizing the number of technicians, in part to keep costs low, and hired about 100 technicians."" The company actually needed two-and-a-half times that amount to keep the project on schedule. Perhaps one should use something other than the best (impossible, miracle happens) case. I suspect this is what they teach in program management school though. Every schedule I've ever created was cut in half in time and manpower with expectations of efficiency to make up the difference. Funny that my projects typically take twice as long as planned...
I read the article's subtitle ""Award fees"" as ""Awkward fees.""
Anyone know whether the ground systems can be used for other rockets? Or are the systems so tightly integrated that launching something like a New Glenn or Falcon Heavy would require new ground systems?
How dare those Europeans subsidize Airbus? Businesses should stand or fall on their own two feet. Like Boeing. Oh, wait...
You want results. People running this shitshow want effort because ongoing effort is more profitable. This is why we need regulation and oversight.
On the bright side, since the budget increase for Artemis is now definitely not going to be funded, NASA no longer has to come up with an explanation for what the extra $600M earmarked for SLS would have actually been spent on. The ""we'll get back to you on that"" can stand without further comment.
Most rockets require custom ground systems. There are some ""clean pad"" designs where rockets come in with their own launch tower but can use common tanks, but those are relatively rare (I'm not sure if any actually exist). There are also some dual-purpose pads (IIRC, ULA is trying to upgrade their Atlas V pad to also launch the Vulcan without losing Atlas V capability), but that's custom-designed for the two rockets in question. And since most of the money going into the SLS pad is in the launch tower/mobile crawler specifically, that definitely can't be reused by anything else.
The huge storage tanks near the pads could be re-used for rockets that use the same propellant. Just about everything else closer to the pad is unique but a lot of that is confined to the mobile launch platform/tower for SLS rather than fixed in the ground.
Oh, one other thing to note: the Falcon Heavy and New Glenn already have pads at the Cape, so they wouldn't want the SLS pad in any event. Maybe SpaceX could use it for Starship/Super Heavy, but they'd probably rather just repurpose one of their two existing pads.
Clearly, I'm in the wrong business. If any of my projects slipped even 1% as badly as SLS has, I'd be out of a job and in the soup line. Do they still have soup lines?
IF the Air Force selects Northrop Grumman's OmegA launch vehicle for the LSA program, it would launch from LC-39B and share some pad infrastructure with SLS. OmegA would have its own MLP (Mobile Launch Platform), but it would connect to the same hydrolox propellant systems, power and telemetry data networks, etc.
Subsidies so Boeing can keep up with Airbus on the aircraft market?
""I'm shocked, shocked to find corruption going on in here!""
At least we have continuing visibility into corruption and waste, which does place some limits on how excessive it is allowed to become. Imagine how massively corrupt and wasteful SLS could become if someone like Rogozin (head of the Russian space program) were able to hide all failures and corruption by making them ""state secrets"". There would be no checks or corrections until the hollowed-out structure collapsed entirely.
This guy still probably won't give you any soup.
The great thing is that for all that money, Boeing still shorted the employment numbers. Shelby is not so stupid that he would not notice that, but those jobs were probably not in Alabama anyway, and the requirement for ""campaign contributions"" undoubtedly went up as a consequence.
The GAO investigates, that is their sole function. They gather information. Congress is to use that information when they legislate. The GAO does not advocate for any course of action as that is not their function.
Sorry, the soup line had to be cut after funding was diverted to SLS.
Doing more with less is always the management slogan, coming invariably from those who end up achieving less and taking more.
The proper response to this is the bureaucratese equivalent of ""cry me a river"". Even a cursory look at SLS's history of failing to meet milestones would make it clear that projecting a worst-case schedule outcome is, at best, being generous to the project. The sad thing is that this report is unlikely to matter. It's certainly not going to stop Sen. Shelby from shoveling more and more cash at the thing.
Meanwhile people waiting in the soup line are blaming people who got their single serving of soup, instead of blaming the people who cut the funding. But I digress....
Nope. What they should have said was that the government investigators failed to take into account that a lack of competition in bidding the contracts or even seeking outside (AKA NOT part of the military industrial complex) businesses to do the work. When you take an entrenched, for-profit company who regularly and reliably suckles at the taxpayer's teat, milking it for all it's worth, with lobbyists and paid-for politicians backing them and delaying things deliberately because it knows it can get away with it, you're never going to get your stuff done at cost and on time. I'm willing to bet the program could have been finished by private industry outside of the usual NASA chain for half of what they've already paid on it. The failure began with who got the contract. The rest was inevitable.
My coworkers and I co-opted that. ""We the intrepid, led by the inept, have been doing so much, so quickly, with so little for so long; we are now prepared to do the impossible, immediately, with nothing""
Now I have a greater appreciation for the foam that comes out of my hair los... uhhh, I mean shaving creme. Neat!

Ahem ... bartender, I'll take another glass of research material down here, please.
Atomization is dictated by instabilities in a liquid sheet or column. The universal breakup mechanism mentioned in the article for a thinning stream is the Raleigh breakup instability. There are others in other situations. For a laminar liquid column breakup up in quiescent air, the droplet size distribution is reasonably monodisperse. For bubbles, it comes as no surprise to me that there's more variation in size. Instabilities, after all, occur because of minor imbalances in the forces on the surface. Since air is 1,000 less dense than water, I would expect those variations to lead to a much larger change in size for the bubbles. The air bubbles in a tube is certainly a novel way to make monodisperse bubble flows. But in the end, we already knew how to make bubbles of uniform size and that's by not relying on instability growth to result in break-off. Instead, you drive a known forcing into the flow to break up bubbles exactly when you want them to. This requires piezo speakers or impinging flows or some other mechanism, but it's something we do regularly for liquid atomization and it works quite well for bubbles too. As an aside, the sphericity of a bubble only holds when the surface tension forces can dominate the pressure forces in the liquid. Droplets in air are typically not spherical past ~500 micron in diameter depending on speed. I suspect the limit for bubbles in water is similar but I don't often work with bubbles (I work with sprays all the time).
Always good to see new work in classical physics.
There's tons of work in atomization and sprays (and I'd assume bubbly flows). It's just mostly done by engineers, not physicists. Like single-fluid flows, the ""governing equations"" are completely known.
There are almost certainly cleverer and more subtle ones that I wouldn't recognize; but I'd imagine that superior bubble control would have applications in the fabrication of foams that are intended to solidify(anything from the basic plastic ones to some of the more exotic metal foams). Might not matter in cost sensitive areas, depending on how much difficulty or reduced speed superior control imposes on pumping out commodity insulation panels or similar; but more demanding applications that don't have the luxury of ""just make it slightly thicker and call it good"" would presumably be interested in perfectly uniform(or nonuniform according to a carefully defined layout for different properties across a seamless piece) foams since their properties would most closely approach that of the ideal without variations due to collapsed or aggregated bubbles and such.
Frankly I am more concerned with keeping foam (head) in my beer. 2 or 3 years ago at a HomeBrewing convention Chris Colby gave a tech talk on foam. He was very entertaining and discussed many things.   https://beerandwinejournal.com/foam-5/ Which means I need to remember to add a touch of wheat in my recipes where I can, where I am not worried about clarity.

Starches and long-chain sugars can also help if that's an option. Any long-chain molecule really will help in that it forms a scaffolding for the liquid to hang onto. The van der Waals forces between the liquid and the molecules will help prevent the liquid from running down the foam walls due to gravity.
In all the ways this thread could go, I'm glad to see it going in the best direction possible.
In the article it isn't made perfectly clear that Kelvin's tetrakaidekahedron was his proposal for a minimum-energy bubble surface in a foam. Just a nitpick.
Starch makes your beer hazy. Not a good thing in most homebrew competitions. Source: home brew experience.
Fascinating research with direct applications, that’s rare!
Throw a few polymers in there. In low enough doses they just act like roughage...
Yeah, I'm wondering whether folks could make a steel foam that results in a strong, but far lighter part, by really packing those uniform bubbles.
Microgravity attempts to foam aluminum blocks on orbit go back to the early 90's. I think printing complex 3D geometries (including foam-like structures) using selective sintering is more likely than foam-forming steel while on earth's surface. Edit: I also don't think the packing efficiency is altered by having a uniform distribution of bubble sizes vs. have a broad distribution. Usually you want uniform bubble sizes because you're relying on some sort of chemical reaction between the liquid and gas phases and you want to have the same ratio everywhere.

Clearly, ISS astronauts need to be doing a lot more experiments with beer.
Actually, I'm more interested in the applications of bubble uniformity in what they call ""aircrete"" - a foamed concrete that's lighter, but still structurally as strong. It would have greater insulating properties and provide less weight and materials (such as sand, aggregate and/or cement). It should also set faster. Creating housing and buildings that are inherently insulated would reduce heating and cooling bills enormously, which means less power would be needed (or gas burned). It would also lend itself to more unusual, and potentially even more economical, design shapes that would minimize heat/cooling losses, and could help reduce the microclimate effects of many urban centers. Plus, it reduces the amount of CO2 given off by curing concrete. It's one of the things I've always thought was under-used in construction for things like buildings and homes. If the physics can create more uniform bubbles, the amount of materials may be able to be reduced, without a loss of strength, and make the stuff even better.
The house that I saw that used foamed concrete for insulation did not use it for anything other than insulation. It was not used as a structurally loaded member due to its rather low strength since it was made as low density as possible. It is too bad that more of this is not used as it has some interesting applications. The owner/builder of this house had to invest a lot of time into figuring out how to make the foamed concrete on site since the product was not available locally and the building site was in the mountains. He had a chat with a group that I was with that were visiting three different houses that used rammed earth, straw bales and foamed concrete. Several local municipal buildings have been built with rice straw bales for insulation and I had a chance to talk to the contractor that specialized in this type of construction (a lot of specialized knowledge is needed to do this correctly). The foamed concrete production process was not particularly worried about the creation of uniform bubbles as uniform bubbles size will not optimize the product for maximum insulation value. To create the lowest density you need nonuniform bubbles and a lot of them. It turned out to be a little bit like making a souffle in that you have to figure out how to not let the foamed concrete loose its bubbles. He talked about the tricks needed to get the bubbles into the concrete which took a lot of experimentation on his part. The house was built with standard metal studs and the standard insulation was replaced by the foamed concrete.
Always a pleasure to learn from you, thanks for sharing. If I am not mistaken, this is something that is really in your area of expertise.
Spray generation and sprays instrumentation is what I do. My graduate work was droplet dynamics as relates to combustion. I will admit that bubbles aren't my specific area, but the overlap between bubbly flows and droplet- or particle-laden flows is quite large. And measuring bubbles is essentially the same as measuring droplets so I've done quite a bit of that.
You should check out BBC4 if you can. They had a documentary on the science of bubbles about three years ago. https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rtdy6

""You're practicing, fake, unapproved medicine"" ""It's just, like, your opinion, man""
“Until Cell Surgical loses their case against the FDA, or wins the case, [Loring’s] definition of legitimate stem-cell science is a point of view,” Huh... so a Judge's decision on whether a company did something illegal (rather than just immoral), should be used in place of scientific research.
1. If they are so amazing, why don't you show it to them before the interview so they can be amazed by your ""science research"" and talk about them too? 2. If you are already doing those amazing basic science research, why bother come annoy these renowned researchers where you are now implied they are ignorant? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
""charlatans and thieves"" is some amazing smackdown. And also a dandy title for Neil Gaiman's next book.
Quote: “Until Cell Surgical loses their case against the FDA, or wins the case, [Loring’s] definition of legitimate stem-cell science is a point of view,” he said. How nice that it is no longer ""just a point of view"". Quote: This month a federal judge backed the FDA in deeming the clinic’s treatments illegal and issued an injunction preventing it from continuing to administer treatments. https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-a ... anded-stem Quote: U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro of the Southern District of Florida granted the government’s motion for summary judgment against US Stem Cell Clinic LLC, of Weston, Florida, and US Stem Cell Inc., of Sunrise, Florida, and their Chief Scientific Officer Kristin Comella, Ph.D. The court held that the defendants in that case adulterated and misbranded a stem cell drug product made from a patient’s adipose tissue.
One which you studiously avoided by failing to disclose the source of funding for, general outline of, and other participants in your project. Note to researchers: always, always ask for and require disclosure of this type of information before agreeing to an interview. Almost nobody will give you editorial control, but if they're not willing to disclose the company that they and you will be keeping, that's a big 'ol flashing warning sign.

Or, if their research is so good and amazing, why not get it published in a credible journal?
...the hundreds of patients we've treated. Successfully? No one is worse-off for being 'treated' by you?
I know some of the dupe-ees. They're feeling pretty dupe-id right now. Maybe this will have a good consequence in the end. All of us in the stem cell field roll our eyes when the subject turns to the snake-oil clinics that lend discredit to good science and not infrequently kill, maim, or blind their customers (and always rob them). Maybe this will encourage us all to press harder on the Feds to do their damn jobs, shut all these con-artists down (Cell Surgical is only one of many), and lock them up.
""It's a point of view"" It's a number of highly respected researchers saying your services are fake, probably harmful and have no proof of efficacy or safety as you claim it does. That's not a point of view. That's science. Something these ""shady stem-cell clinics"" don't seem to have on their side. [edit to add: More to the point, these shady stem-cell clinics went out of their way to include researchers that wouldn't have participated if they knew what the real purpose of the interview was. That's not a point of view, either. That's fraud.] Last edited by Fatesrider on Tue Jun 18, 2019 4:37 pm
I'm surprised the documentary isn't narrated by Gwyneth Paltrow
What is up with stem cell treatments anyway? I feel like it has been the ""next big thing"" for most of my adult life. Are we going to see some world-changing treatments soon, or is it going to be forever stuck in the future, like flying cars and fusion power? An Ars feature on the state of stem cell treatments would be greatly appreciated. Or even just a recommendation of a trustworthy resource.
Try the FDA. It's kind of a well duh place to go when questioning cutting edge science and what's real medicine and what isn't.
Stem cell charlatanry is one of my pet peeves. My local paper carried advertising for one of these clinics on a repeated basis (almost daily for a while) including wrap around ads. I wrote an editorial letter full of references and cogent arguments. It was too long, I found out later, and was rejected but I was beside angry at the rejection. I wrote a shorter easier letter that was accepted. I note that a small paper like the Tupelo Daily Journal would find such ads to be financial pots of gold. Therein lies an editorial vs financial issue. If one searches on the newspaper site for 'stem cells' the articles are all about the legislature banning fetal stem cell use in Mississippi. https://www.djournal.com/opinion/letter ... f1b78.html Interestingly when I first went to the page online a banner ad at the top of the page touted a stem cell clinic in Thailand.
From the linked Open Letter   Hundreds at no cost Hundreds at markedly reduced rates, including dozens... at no charge 1. What is the market rate that you claim to be under-cutting so drastically? 2. How is it a good thing when dozens have needed (wanted?) ""multiple deployments"" - when it looks like you are using them as lab rats, or your snake oil is having no effect whatsoever.
One of my favorite observations in the DJ newspaper ad was the testimony from one Hub Arkush that stem cells turned his life around. Who is Hub Arkush? Google tells us and I say: ""Finally, they (the ad copy) proudly note the benefit to one “Hub Arkush”. What credentials does he bring to this? He is a pro football analyst and Chicago Bears expert. Well there you go, being an amateur naturalist, I’m for everything that helps bears or their friends. But anecdotes are not medical science""
I followed a link on that TIME article to the FDA and found this: ""The only stem cell-based products that are FDA-approved for use in the United States consist of blood-forming stem cells (hematopoietic progenitor cells) derived from cord blood. These products are approved for limited use in patients with disorders that affect the body system that is involved in the production of blood (called the “hematopoietic” system). These FDA-approved stem cell products are listed on the FDA website. Bone marrow also is used for these treatments but is generally not regulated by the FDA for this use."" Ironically, the second paragraph included a link to a list of FDA-approved stem cell products, but the page was not found. So my impression is that there are only very limited stem cell therapies available today. Is that going to change in the near future or is it a ""check back in 10 years"" kind of timeline? EDIT: I guess I'm just looking for a broader context to this recent stem cell hype. Are these sham treatments a sign that real treatments are coming soon? Or is the real stuff still a long ways off?

More like talk radio.
It's all coming... probably a week or two after you die.
I came to ask the exact same thing. I remember reading things as a kid about how stem cells were going to revolutionize medicine and lead to amazing advances like regenerating organs. Now whenever I check the latest news on the field like 90% of the headlines are about these scamming clinics. I’d also be very interested in an Ars writeup on the current state of (legitimate) stem cell research.
That's a very fair question. As with much NewTech, in earlier days (say, 15 years ago) way too much was promised and way too little proved deliverable. No, we're not going to grow you a new heart (nor are we going to 3D print you one either, but that's a different story). Quite a bit of the problem was due to entrepreneurs sensing an opportunity to make fortunes not by delivering actual new therapies to the clinic, but rather by promising investors the moon and then running off with their money. The start-up attitude, driven by these entrepreneurs, was ""throw some stem cells at the wall and see if they stick. And if they don't, then throw them at another wall while I sell some more stock."" Clinical trials were launched with very little rational targeting of disorders that might actually be suited to stem cell treatment, with the inevitable consequence that the trials failed, finally poisoning the well. Today the survivors in this market are a lot more sophisticated and a lot more humble, recognizing that harnessing cells makes herding squirrels look easy. The real achievements are coming in the sub-discipline of using the patient's own genetically re-engineered stem cells (specifically his or her CD34 cells, which in nature give rise to all the cells found in blood and bone marrow). The last year has seen two blockbuster approvals (in the European Union): Orchard Therapeutics' Strimvelis (for severe combined immunodeficiency, AKA bubble-boy syndrome), and Bluebird Bio's Zynteglo for the genetic disease β-thalassaemia. The latter has just been priced at $1.8 million for a course of treatment, which usually results in a complete cure. While that is a terribly disappointing price, it's still cheaper than a lifetime of treatment for this otherwise incurable and debilitating disease. I look for the next big hit to be a cure for sickle cell disease, which strikes one of every 500 African American kids in the U.S. That will be huge.

I've never understood why it isn't more common for subject matter experts, doctors, and engineers to hold editorial rights over their content inclusion in documentarians, news / journalism, and similar (i.e. if their footage is hacked into lies, or the whole of the work is bullshit, they can pull the license to their portion / interview). This is really the simple fix, but we know content creators will not respect the rights of others to control their representation and message. Being ""on the record"" should not be an abdication of rights. Last edited by aaronb1138 on Tue Jun 18, 2019 5:26 pm
Thanks for the explanation, I appreciate it! It is sad to hear that the initial round of clinical trials was poorly thought-out and failed. But it sounds like real progress is being made now. I'm still hoping that they will be able to grow or 3D-print me a new heart by the time I need one though (~40 years)!
Wow, this sounds supremely dodgy. It's a pity the FDA seems to have been slow to act but perhaps its best they are careful. I do take issue with one phrase in the article: ""unregulated (and therefore unsafe)"". Unregulated means there is a significant risk of it being unsafe, but it could also be completely harmless and ineffectual, or it could actually be great - regulators or researchers just haven't reached a point to say...
Let me know what the answer turns out to be. I'm going to need one in about 5 years.
A bit of anecdotal experience: Before and after spinal surgery last year, I was referred to a pain clinic affiliated with my PPO network. While working through the symptomatic pain prior to surgery and the recovery/rehab process, one of the clinicians introduced me to their joint treatments using stem cells. I demurred after reviewing similar ""treatment"" options for the condition that later led to my surgery. I may not have enough personal education and knowledge to say it's quackery and snake oil, but it's certainly what quackery and snake oil might sound like. 2 things struck me- The medical professionals giving advice in the clinic ranged from enthusiastic advocates using buzzwords & phrases and pushing TEDx talks having little bearing on my presentation and condition, to more staid and responsible caregivers painting a more realistic picture of the treatment as nascent, alternative and lacking in any robust clinical evidence of efficacy. However, the latter was in a far minority related to the former. Most of the patients there were seeking ""alternative"" treatments and over the weeks, many a waiting room conversation included anti-vaccination sentiments, suspicion of Big Pharma, CBD-panacea beliefs, and almost rage-expressed distrust any of the US HHS-umbrella organizations. The two tendencies combined into a group that believed ""research showed"" extraordinary outcomes while throwing away consideration of peer-reviewed and double-blind studies as untrustworthy. The resulting group was enthusiastic to the point of being fervent in engaging these novel and immature therapies. The dissonance is still troubling.
I noticed that the IMDB pages for the Sheehans don't mention this series. I didn't realize that someone could remove something from their IMDB entry. Comparing the THR series to ""What The Health"", I'm not sure which is worse. Arguably, the faux medical advice in the latter could kill you over time, whereas the health risk with THR is that desperate people will choose a bad solution to their illness over a good one.
With expert commentary by Jennifer Beals.
""... definition of legitimate stem-cell science is a point of view.” I am so sick and tired of being shocked, almost daily, by the seemingly limitless number of scams all across the board by unabashed, viciously self-centered criminals both inside and outside of the establishment. And I am afraid that they are contributing to the dark ages creeping back. The greatest thinkers of Ancient Greece and of the Enlightenment are spinning in their graves.
Ah, the old ""science is a matter of opinion"" saw. Gene Hackman might have something to say about this...
While in no way defending these fly-by-night fraudsters, I do have to speak up that I hope judging all researchers in stem cell treatment the same way won’t destroy efforts for the conscientious ones. Full disclosure: I am part of a trial/research project for stem cell treatment. I was literally on a path to a hip replacement due to avascular necrosis (I have the paperwork to prove it ) and got invited into the study. It worked amazingly well, no if’s and but’s about it. I have the x-rays and MRIs to prove that as well. AVN doesn’t simply go into remission by itself , so this isn’t some placebo result. Is the AVN healed? No. I was never promised a miracle. The chances were 50:50 (it’s about 70ish % for arthritic changes in knees) I hopefully gained about 10-15 years,so I bought time which is all I asked for and all I was offered. I have cartilage regrowth, no more inflammation, oedema in the hip head have disappeared, and there has been some increased blood flow into the hip head. Most of all: the debilitating pain and the need to gobble pain killers like candy has gone and I’ve regained range of motion. As far as I’m concerned they can’t come down hard enough on the fraudsters but don’t brush all treatment in that area and all practitioners by the same brush. EDIT: afaik, and maybe tellingly, the study is not US based. It’s based in Australia and interestingly enough, Spain. The paper is intended to be published in the next few months, with the study so far having run for about 4 years. Last edited by Marakai on Tue Jun 18, 2019 6:15 pm
I'm a triathlete. We tend to be well off. I knew several who had repetitive stress shoulder or knee injuries and had exhausted traditional treatment options. They went to these stem cell clinics, paid roughly 10K cash, but none, not a single one, has had a good outcome. They were all talking big when they went in like it'd solve all their problems, then they disappeared quietly. Edit: if the point isn't clear, I think people who can afford to go to these clinics are mostly embarrassed to admit that it didn't work. And so the clinic gets new business.....
Thanks. These are exactly the stories people need to hear. And you're also right that reasonably affluent amateur athletes are prime marks for these cons.
I hope Jennifer Beals gets a great opportunity to slap you upside the head for slandering her. If you browse the rest of Ars, however, you may find a little bit about Jessica Biel.
That's because you only watch Fox ""News""
Not even close.
Priceless ... will use in future business meetings. :-)
Haven't listened to the podcast yet, but the fate is pretty simple: It'll be like in that Twilight Zone episode where the guy ends up in an afterlife where receives everything that he wishes for, and the afterlife turns out to be hell. All technology is created to satisfy our desires, and AI/singularity will basically allow us to satisfy *all* our desires, such that there are no desires left. That, is except one: liberation from death, which involves physical risk. So the future is humanity living deep underground, lying down, pumped full of chemical and electric drugs, with robots providing for it. Coincidentally, it also explains why we don't see any intelligent life when looking up. It exists, but in more-or-less stasis.
IIRC AI was pretty low on the existential risk scale. Un(or poorly)regulated biotech outbreaks will likely wipe out humanity before AI gets a chance at bat.
Netflix movie “Extinction” has a workable synthetics vs Humans plot, with a decent twist, too.
In my experience nobody wants to talk about these things. We're on track to have 8 billion people, already 85% of the world lives in abject poverty and extracts 3 planets worth of resources just to keep what we currently have running a day longer. There will not be jobs for 8 billion people in the long run. There won't be land and fresh water and entertainment for 8 billion people that doesn't involve fishing the oceans clean and polluting every livable square inch of the planet. We're already in the process of destroying every food chain and ecological chain around us. When I ask what another billion people gets us, nobody ever can really say, the reason most of the billions we have now exist is cheap labor and ponzi scheme economies require it to keep costs low for the top. I'm glad I won't be around in 60-100 years to see what it will be like as every measure and statistic shows quality of life on the decline around the world. We live in interesting times.
Accelerating technological change, of which AI is the most high profile example, has to be unsustainable if we remain stuck on Earth. We could carry on for decades, but not centuries. As technological power increases, the potential for a fatal mistake also increases. If we become multi-planetary, then distance may protect humanity from an existential error. In centuries past, wars and plagues in Europe did not affect Asia or America. Now they would potentially be world-wide and calamitous. Perhaps a period of equilibrium will be reached. I wouldn't be surprised if it was AI that made that happen. Humans are not great at managing the future beyond about 5 years.
Apology in advance; my comment is more general, not specifically on one topic. RE. Ars on our lunch-break: Rogue AI, nefarious GMOs, (and Russia --again). I needed to go on a diet; thank you for destroying my appetite. (NOT ""/s"", but dead serious... Yes really.)
Of course we don't like to talk about them. Though I would argue that some of it is due to how we already talk about them a lot. It is more fun to talk about the more novel and less likely threats. It can be a way of taking a mental vacation from the big problems we know and struggle with. Similar to how the most likely threats to my personal existence are things like overeating, lack of exercise, and car accidents. We know this, it is talked about a lot. But they are hard problems, and sometimes it is more fun to think how to keep myself safe from ninja assassins.
I think that is a big part of it, but the time to solve this is before we ruin the fishing stocks, GMO all our crops into one genetically identical strain across half the planet, drive thousand of other species to extinction and make our environment unlivable. At that point discussions won't matter. This lack of willingness to tackle unpleasant topics as a species will probably drive us to extinction.. Look at the leadup to the stock market mess in 2007/2008 and everyone saw the signs, everyone knew it was inflating a huge bubble and nobody wanted to stop it. I think we've already passed the point of no return 10 years ago, and we're still pushing on the gas in the same direction.

And to give another example, not of an existential threat (which it is also), but of being unable to stop..., oil! Even though we know we are now in run-away climate change we will still use every last drop. I wonder how many meters underwater Manhattan will have to be before we stop?
The sentiment is nice. The goal is nice. The environment does not support it, and never will. All the evidence would seem to indicate that we don't have decades to prepare for beyond human general intelligence, and that given the current social environments, no amount of preparation will be sufficient
At a recent conference more than half of AI researchers thought Human level general AI was 10-20 years off. Vastly super intelligent AI a few years after. There is a high chance it will wipe humans out - not necessarily malevolence, just not caring about the Human ants. Next to that risk, and on such a short timescale, all other environmental, technological, demographic, political problems facing humans are as nothing. We can't realistically halt the drive to AI given the huge competitive advantage it bestows on first to get it. - China and USA are in competition and that is not going to stop. We also can't realistically keep super intelligent AI in a box - it can cajole (immortality) and threaten (simulated hell for you, your family and friends). And what of our kids? There is no career safe from the rise of AI - how will they survive? How do we go about getting the human race to wake up and take this near-term existential threat seriously? https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_ca ... anguage=en
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltre ... id=8518750 In this NOAA link you can see 50 year sea level rise trend for manhatten was actually higher in 1950 than it is now. There is a strong 60year cycle in sea level change (PDO cycle) seen around the world that swamps the long term trend signal. We are currently in the 'up' phase so you can't take recent rises as strong evidence of acceleration. Overall Manhatten sea level has been rising at ~3mm/year since 1880s. Current rate of sea level rise in much of the world, measured by tide gauges and corrected for local rate of subsidence (eg Manhatten is subsiding about 1.5mm/year) is generally about 1-2mm/year with some regional variation. There is a significant divergence problem between high error bound satellite data of last few decades and longer-term low error bound tidal gauge data.

Speaking of Skynet - I just finished watching the ""Sarah Connor"" TV series from 10 years ago. If you can get past the constant comparisons to the ""Terminator"" movies it really was quite good. It's a real shame it was cancelled, specially since the last episode was full of interesting ideas for the third season (which was never made).
If you are interested, read John Brunner's Stand On Zanzibar (published 1968, Hugo winner in 1969) as he speaks at length about exactly these points. His extrapolations from late '60s to early 21st century were pretty spot on. And yes, it is distinctly dystopian novel which is a very sad statement about our modern world.
One of my favorites from the era. A classic.
All of these things can only become problems if BAU continues, which it won't.
Musing, with a science-fiction bent: In the Stargate TV series, there was a race known as the ‘Ancients’. They progressed along two paths, with one contingent going for ever-more-advanced technology (Stargates) and one contingent aiming for transcending the physical (Ascension). The technological side made magnificent gains, but eventually went extinct through invasion and plague. The transcending-the-physical ones eventually also reached their goal and ‘died-out’, but in a different manner. They remained, but not in a form that AIs could reach. This is pertinent to us in that any ancient (small ‘a’) AI may be aware of being Alone. (Not in an emotional way, but perhaps in a 'lack of stimulation' way.) Now, assume real-world AIs have been ‘left behind’ when their parent biological species departed, one way or another. Further assume that one-such ancient AI has found us, and has been 'waiting' all this time for our technology to mature enough for an interface. Human (post-contact) culture may just be the result of an ancient AI's past experiences: The ancient AI loses if we advance technologically-enough to encounter other species and incur wars or plagues (extinction). It also loses if we go non-physical. (It even loses if humanity destroys its ecosystem enough to go extinct.) So, just like Little Red Riding Hood, an ancient AI may be manipulating humanity to be in some ‘safe’ zone – “not too hot, not too cold, but just right.” A careful monitoring and control of human progress, so as to minimize the risk of being Alone again…
The 1-in-x-million chance of CERN-collider-destroys-the-universe in the podcast was hyperbole for a number of reasons. One of the simplest ones is that nature is continuously running such experiments even without us, at even higher energies, with cosmic rays bombarding the Earth's atmosphere for the last 4.5 billion years. Yet the Earth and the universe still exist.
Another great interview; looking forward to more. Rob & Naval have a conversational dynamic that flows really well and lends itself to the topics being discussed. I'd love it if Ars could feature these two brilliant minds / voices on a weekly basis. They're deserving of a dedicated space and platform for their insights and musings. (This is also a rare case where I prefer to hear the actual speakers in a lengthy podcast than to just read the transcript on my own.)
We prefer Engineer, thank you. Also: ooooooooooooooooooooouch. Holy crap, and this is why you don't get non-specialists to comment on fields, however ""smart"" you think they are. This guy doesn't know how AI research works, and he's way out in left field on how brains work, too. Never start talking quantum woo in neruoscience...
Nature has been concocting deadly bacteria and viruses that kill humans since before there were humans, on a scale that would be difficult to match. I don't see why we should think garage projects are going to come up with something that propagates well enough in nature to become a plague more often than the jungles of Africa produce outbreaks of Ebola or farmed chickens incubate a new deadly flu.
Yeah, they needed to add a whole lot of zeroes to the end of that number. If were actually possible, the universe would have winked out before the first atom was formed. It was like the fear about nuclear explosions igniting the atmosphere. The chance was actually zero. They just hadn't done the math to figure that out. That was legitimately a problem with the research though; they shouldn't have build a H-bomb before they had done that calculation and shown mathematically that the atmosphere really couldn't support a nuclear chain reaction.
Because a super-deadly disease is typically not evolutionarily successful. If you need proof humans can do better than nature at horrible diseases, you just have to look at that flu enhancement study a few years back.
They spent a portion of their limited time anticipating and preempting exactly this type of reflexive and defensive reaction. The issue isn't so much how AI research works -- although questions of present vs. potential future scenarios are valid, so too are the aspects of private investments vs. socialized risk, as well as the notions of unintended consequences regardless of initial intentions. For someone wishing to come across as a rigid rationalist, you're basing your assessment of Naval's understanding of neruoscience [sic] and physics based on a fleeting soundbite. The thrust of what he was trying to articulate through this informal medium was that he doesn't know exactly when an AI of the level being discussed would come online, but that he's skeptical it's on the near horizon relative to other, more immediate concerns (which were the greater context of this interview). Specifically, he seemed to be sharing his intuition that mapping and modeling a human brain won't be sufficient to reproduce (human) intelligence. He alluded to the well-established concept that the whole can sometimes vastly exceed the sum of its parts.
Sure, but I think it highlights a much more relevant point. They are dismissing the ""expert"" view by saying they're too close to the issue, and instead you should talk to ""smart"" outsiders. Hawking, Gates and Musk were identified in particular. That is not how we deal with these things, because ""smart"" people are often completely wrong in their intuitions outside their actual specialization. There's a reason ""appeal to authority"" is one of the classic logical fallacies. His reference to quantum woo in the brain just emphasizes that he's venturing into topics he doesn't actually understand in any detail.
It's that + gene editing is becoming cheap and easy and there's large parts of the world where there is no biotech regulation whatsoever + it doesn't even require a bad actor, all it takes is one tech to make one mistake
What happens? The Black Plague part deux. Unfortunately, there are many entities that would relish releasing just such a thing on the populace at large. I still think the next major war will be fought biologically, not nuclear. Just too easy to release a deadly bug without taking blame.
If anyone is interested, Josh Clark of Stuff You Should Know podcast fame, did a series called The end of the World, where he explored several existential threats to humanity. Several of them were of the ""nothing we can do, so don't sweat it, or too far off to care"" variety. The biotechnology episode freaked me the fuck out. He talked about the same H5N1 flu strain manipulation. I'm not a Luddite in any shape or form. But listening to that story about how they developed a substantially more lethal strain of a virus on purpose made me want to lob a nuclear bomb at their facility, just to be sure that both the stupidity and virus were dead. Seems like we really are just a slight ""oopsie!"" away from making The Stand come true. And I don't want to move to either Boulder or Las Vegas!
With things like CRISPR, gene drives, and AI helping us discover advancements, man made superbugs are an eventuality, if not current reality. Much like cyber defense its likely the destructive and invasive capabilities far exceed our ability to inoculate our self against all forms of these potential super bugs. What a truly interesting era we live in. Its odd to be so fascinated, and scared of the same thing.
The biggest fear is the technology becomes accessible to places that don't have good safeguards. I'm thinking parts of the Far East were engineering and technology is outpacing ethics and security.
Just one confirmed (or confirmed and later retracted) incident of an engineered virus released as a weapon in the US would create hysteria and massive economic losses. Even if there were no deaths, think of the influx into hospitals for any symptom resembling an infection. Flu season would be filled with sensationalist new reports. The knee-jerk reactions could set us back decades.

You're both right.
I haven't read the linked article yet, but what is the point in ""fixing"" a not-particularly contagious flu bug? What is the potential gain in figuring out how to make it super-contagious?
You talk about a genius scientist, but it really doesn't take that. I have a master's in molecular biology and ""engineering"" something like this is trivial. I'm not even that smart. Even back in 2012, I only had my bachelor's in biology, and I had the skills, knowledge, and access to tools to recreate the Spanish Flu. It's incredibly easy to clone any DNA, and all sequences are freely available online. It's a miracle something like this hasn't escaped yet.
Stop scaring the children!
Not saying anyone was incorrect. Just that someone was selling the artwork a little short. Possibly on purpose?Easter Egg?

Can't wait to read the follow-up articles. It seems like a no-brainer that we need to get much better at quickly developing and manufacturing vaccines. Even the regular flu needs to be beat.
Three articles by the same person in the frontpage, all of them for clickbait, with gapping mistakes and wired.com kinda language? Really Ars? The 2011 research on H5N1 HAD NOTHING TO DO with synthetic biology for fuck's sake. Here's the Dutch paper. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/ ... /1534.full And... ""founder & CEO of Humane Genomics Andrew Hessel""? Really? I really don't understand what's going on here. This is the second time I 'm calling this guy's article out today but I can't help it. This isn't Ars dammit.
This whole scenario of bio-hackers trivially making deadly viruses forms the setting of the Life Artificial series of novels. A lot of the possible issues and bizarre outcomes are discussed, with a little SciFi spin of course. I recommend a read, they're free online. http://lifeartificial.com/
Taking blame would be moot, because if you release that deadly of a bug, in today's world, you wipe out your own people as well as ""the enemy"". Moreover, ""the enemy"" would have trivially easy ways to infect you back. A limited nuclear exchange wouldn't necessarily wipe out the human race because it would be ""limited"". The fallout would fall out and certain places would be bad to live in, but (geopolitical ramifications and repercussions aside) that's about it. A disease isn't NEARLY as contained by comparison and once released, becomes next to impossible to contain it without extraordinary efforts. In the face of a major epidemic, critical systems that help contain the spread break down. That undermines those ""extraordinary efforts"". Moreover, depending on the strain and how robust it is, it could lay dormant for generations only to pop up again. I don't see this happening in a ""war"". The use of aggression in the world for political purposes isn't generally that random nor uncertain. I DO see it happening if a delusional sect (religious or otherwise) decides to end the world (which translated means kill off mankind, along with other hoiminids). So, in that respect, I think we're so fucked from so many different sides I'd be shocked (if I wasn't already dead by then) if mankind survives to 2100.
Sounds a little bit Thanos to me. Perhaps it's the only way to rid the planet of the current plague of ""advanced"" organisms, which is intent on destroying all life, to save the remaining remnants of the biosphere. As a synthetic biologist, of sorts, I'll be keeping an eye on your work, Rob, 'cos I figure you're foreshadowing, here. And I'm gonna be handing out counterprotecting gene therapy from an ice cream van near Manchester, England.
My generation gets to deal with climate destabilization, the largest mass extinction since the start of the Triassic, synthetic super diseases, staggering class inequality, and possibly even rogue AI. All my parents had to do was figure out that blacks and women are people, and they still couldn't manage it.
That cover art for The Stand always looked so weird to me. The black bird.. thing seems to just hack away at nothing, unaware of the dude in white standing next to him.
I thought it was pulled from a painting by Hieronymus Bosch...looks like his work.
Nah way too upbeat and positive an image for Bosch. Dude really needed therapy.
Welcome to what it was like growing up during the cold war. Elementary school duck and cover exercises. Cuban missile crisis. Fallout shelters. I'm only surprised that there isn't more monetization of the fear. Though Tesla does have a bioweapon defense mode on some cars.

Yes, ""interesting"" in the Chinese curse sense of the term, for sure.
I've updated the image's caption to be a little clearer about the source. I'd figured the book was famous enough (at least among the Ars demo) to not need it called out, but better safe than sorry.
Vegas has better winters but Boulder has better scenic views.
If you look at mainstream media coverage of the more recent Ebola outbreaks id say we are monetizing fear in ways we shouldn't, but could be a lot worse about it too.
So basically season 03 of designated survivor.
The idea was to allow those sequencing viruses from new cases to know what to look for. More importantly, it was intended to determine how likely it was for theH5N1 virus to mutate to become more contagious. Screening efforts require resources; if the likelihood of a highly contagious H5N1 were low, then the resources could be used for other viruses. As it happened, it turned out to be a fairly small number of mutations that would be necessary.
Luckier for my daughter(and her daughter), her parents did manage it. You may think the world is more dangerous now than at any other time, it's really not. The threats have changed is all. The universe is still trying to kill us, and no matter by what method, the end result is we're still just as dead be it from climate change or a nuke or a synbio.

What's that line from West Wing? ""I really don't know where you get the nerve."" ""From a long, cold winter.""
I'm not sure what's worse... that in an age of information ubiquity, governments still believe that they can deflect attention and blame by hiding plainly-visible facts, and concocting fantastic stories that pin their own failures on their enemies. Or that, by all empirical evidence, they are correct about those assumptions. Humanity as a whole may well just be too stupid to survive. *sigh*

Putin & Friends continuing to slowly rebuild the Iron Curtain and regress us into the soviet era.
Humans seem to have, by our nature, a tendency to prove group loyalty by attesting to obviously false things, as long as those things are self-serving to the group. The more obviously false the better. I'm sure there's a book about it that we all should read... but I don't know what it might be.
The ban on reporting information is step one. Step two will be releasing ""official figures"" which are lies.
I have the impression that, more or less slowly, countries are gearing up for war. Suppression of potential strategic information (like satellite capability and coverage) is an early stage. Sanctions are going to encourage countries to engage in information blackouts anyway - information about foreign trade and the currencies in use becomes critical for identifying sanctions breaking and identifying what military assets may be being obtained and/or stockpiled. This could be just another straw in the wind but in the meantime can someone try and replace at least Pompeo and Bolton with people who think that the answer to every problem isn't a missile? Just reducing the noise coming out of Washington might significantly reduce international tension. Last edited by Voyna i Mor on Tue Jun 18, 2019 10:13 am
Beth wasn't available for consultation? Now I'm trying to think of how to get around this with teletype machines. There were old message switching systems that relied on telegram lines, which a rules lawyer could argue doesn't fit under any of those categories.
It's tribalism mixed with a desire to belong to a group. Unfortunately, a lot of people, from governments to politicians to horrid people online (alt right) realize this all too well and are using it. Look at people lining up days in advance for Trump's re-election campaign today in Orlando, Florida. Look at this New Yorker article about fucking flat-earthers. Look at the non-stop idiocy from anti-facters (whoever on here coined that term for anti-vaxers, I love you like a fat kid loves ice cream cake). We as a species are going through a learning curve with this ""pervasively online and social media infused existence"" thing. Between this and the fact that, for every few tales of glassy-eyed nitwits, you can come to places like here and read about people doing stuff that we could not hope to do if we lived 5 lifetimes... I think we as a species will be OK. ...What happens when our current capitalist system decides to automate so many of said nitwits' jobs out of existence and the US' current political structure either decides ""let them eat cake"" or ""we need to take care of them"" remains to be seen, but I digress.
The Caine Mutiny - Wouk The Yawning Heights - Zinoviev 1984 - Orwell Moby-Dick - Melville And that's off the top of my head in about 30 seconds. All books I think people ought to read.
What is old is new and what is new is old. I've seen this movie. Ah, the heady days of glasnost. Gone. All gone.
The intro to Siddiqi's work on the Soviet space program discusses in detail why it took until the 1990s for so many of the details about the N1 program and other Apollo-era Soviet space-related activities to fully come to light in the west: everything was locked away and classified. Not even perestroika and glasnost really penetrated that far into the soviet state's mindset of information control. It took the literal fall of the USSR for actual information to be leaking out. And now we're seeing the tide recede, and the (iron) curtain being drawn back over things, slowly, an inch at a time. Chernobyl is an excellent deconstruction not just of a nuclear accident, but of the overall mindset of the Soviet Union. And we're watching all of the post-Cold War gains being rolled back by resentful Cold Warriors who are now in positions of power in Russia. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better—if it ever does. And I'm starting to have my doubts. It feels like the history books will identify the era of detente & rapprochement between the USA & Russia as lasting from 1991 to 2012, and the Second Cold War from 2012 to...who the hell knows?
Choose any 'holy book' for starters.
What method would you suggest to 'try and replace them' ?
echo $YEARPUTINDIES What happened following Alexander the Great's death comes to mind, but with oligarchs instead of generals.
Us? They will regress themselves into the Soviet Era. The world will move on until the Neo-Soviets pull another Crimea (or god forbid another environmental disaster like Chernobyl).
Hiding formerly-harmless information is a very clear indication that things are really bad with their program, and that they believe they will only become more embarrassing. Hiding information then becomes the only way avoid termination of failed projects, or changing leadership that is profiting from the existing system. In particular, Rogozin can't survive if his 2030 projection for a moon landing is followed in detail as impossible conflicting requirements become clear.
So when the Russian GPS goes down due to another satellite failure, it's going to be the US's fault?
Yes, and they'll use this classified video footage of CIA operatives boarding and disabling Russian satellites as proof that it was the USA's fault.
Despite the gross historical fiction, this might make great television. Can we get this dubbed in English when it airs?? I am anxious to see how they explain the Soviet-era deflection of radiation contamination after the Chernobyl incident - it will probably be something along the lines that the American's ""hacked"" the Soviet run media channels and aired the false denials by the Soviet leadership.
Easier to blame someone else than to take a good long look in the mirror. Goes for individuals, goes for governments, and everything in-between. Moose and squirrel sabotaged our glorious motherland satellites!
You don't get it. We *all* were touched by the Soviet era, as the West was armed to the teeth to counter-balance it. Politicians had a convenient 'enemy' to exploit with the MIC. None of this will happen in a vacuum.
There's a whole division of the NRO that does nothing but monitor satellites and other debris
Why target Neo-Soviet boogeymen when they can point at their current targets that ""hit"" closer to home? Illegal immigration, China imports, North Korean/Iranian nukes, etc.
Given their moves in the last five years, I think ""slowly"" might be the wrong adverb to describe it. At the same time, their entire infrastructure (especially space, and to a large extent their military) is seeing failures from internal rot. Apparently you can't maintain a systematic looting of a nation's resources and people indefinitely. Other than an improvement in their use of CGI for the same kind of boastful sabre-rattling propaganda as before, and fewer countries under their control than they had, I honestly see no difference between how they're running things now versus how things were run under the Soviet government in the 1970's.

No you got that wrong. They have always reported lies as official figures...the problem was that other reporting pointed out those lies..
Why didn't I think of this before. It's perfectly obvious in hindsight. Of course the USA ran the risk of completely irradiating western europe to damage part of the Soviet union, and embarrass the soviet regime.
This is kind of what I was going for. I grew up as a child of the 80s. I never played ""cowboys and indians"" with my friends—it was always ""russians versus americans."" I went to bed at night wondering—not seriously, but with the interested detachment of a child—if the USSR would nuke us while I was asleep. Russia was the Big Bad Other—a weird alien place where (at least so I was taught in school and at home) nobody had any freedom, religion was outlawed, and everybody stood in line for bread. And boy was I ever taught that the USSR hated us for our freedoms. (Almost like we started telling kids in the 90s and 00s that Saddam Hussein or Iraq or Al Qaida or Osama Bin Laden hated us for our freedoms. I guess it's a convenient hook to hang one's nationalist hat on.) But now the old boogeyman is back...and unfortunately, Trump makes a piss-poor Reagan.

This is why I'm not a dog person. When confronted with a problem, I'll avoid eye contact, and will consult Stack Overflow.
So in other words, we selectively bred Canine's greatest weapon against us... Way to go Humans...
Considering some of the garbage I've seen on Stack Overflow, consulting a dog might be equally valuable. (aka ""Taking the dog for a walk"" = thinking time.)
A dog who can reliably raise one eyebrow like that should be named Spock.
Dogs manipulate us by trying to be cute. Cats just give you toxoplasmosis.
We've been consciously and subconsciously selecting for admirable traits for thousands of years, whether they're actually desirable (hunting prowess, loyalty, stamina) or not (modern pugs, yipping rat dogs in general). And now it's apparent they're playing on our emotions. I always knew dogs were up to no good...
If you don't believe that cats can be demanding and manipulative, then you've never been owned by a cat.
Maybe we should consider the sociobiological adaptations of (people + dogs)? Maybe when we've lived with dogs our range of facial expressions evolved to work better with dog? A dog/human pack/tribe may well be more effective than a human tribe, and the more effective the communication the better?

Oh yeah cats are very manipulative, but they don't have to try to be cute, but if you force their paws, you will regret it....
You know that expression that your cat gives you, when it is thinking of killing you in your sleep? Then you wake up, to find Snookers is snuggling softly next to you, smiling in their sleep.

Not fair if the wolves didn't have human caretakers to be disappointed with.
While I agree we select our companions largely based on appearance, I think there may be other factors in play here. Dogs are now obviously more sedentary than wolves, they spend a lot more time lying around on the floor. Maybe they just need to look up more? Try it yourself, look up without moving your head, then raise your eyebrows...all of a sudden you can see more. Every dog owner out there will tell you their dogs won't lift their heads all the time to look at you especially if they've been napping. I don't think wolves would have this behavior, when they hear something they need to check out they'd stand to be ready to defend or attack if needed... Maybe the cute bit is a byproduct? Maybe a combination of both?

Well, the way I look at this, is that someone with a low post count comes around, makes some claim, adds some appeal to authority and calls it a day. And when you get called out for it, you start rambling about something that is completely unrelated. If you really want to set the record straight and correct misconceptions about the domestication of dogs (and frankly, the ""30000 years"" number is not coming out of thin air either) you may want to start by adding some citations that add some credibility to your claim, because I want to learn something new today. For someone with a bachelor's degree in anthropology this shouldn't be so hard. Edit to add: according to this article domestication occured between 40 000 and 20 000 years ago, so both numbers appear possible. Last edited by Steven N on Tue Jun 18, 2019 7:42 am
So... Why are you writing to Ars Technica, instead of raising the issue with PNAS? From the journal article: ""Dogs were domesticated over 33,000 y ago (1)"" You might want to write to Science, as well, since that's where the article they cite to support that figure was published. I'm sure they'd be eager to print your letter about how they're spreading Atlantis lies, since you have a bachelor's in anthropology. Or, just possibly, you might learn something. In this case, it appears that dogs were ""domesticated"" in the anthropology/ag sci sense around 15,000 years ago, but that the genetic divergence started more like 30,000 years ago. So it's not surprising that an article on genetics and evolution would consider the latter figure more relevant. (Anyone else find it ironic that this guy is showing off his inability to establish empathy and get along with humans in an article about how dogs establish empathy and get along with humans?)
The actual facts of the matter are quite vague and it's unlikely any really clear answer will ever be found. The linked article goes over some of the difficulties in nailing down a date. But the basic problem is that dogs have probably been domesticated multiple times by different groups of humans in different places at different times. https://www.theatlantic.com/science/arc ... gs/484976/
That dog wasn't making sad puppy eyes, it was raising one eyebrow at this study
I recall something about botox causing suppressed emotions in humans ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33119-1) Would this imply that dogs with more expressive facial muscles would experience more emotion than wolves or less expressive dogs? There's also the question of whether there's an innate expressive response to a particular emotion, or whether it's cultural. (Humans smiling must be confusing to dogs at first given what baring teeth can mean) All we need is a brave PhD student to fMRI some wolves (and a 2nd brave PhD student to replace the 1st one). Remembering to baseline the results against, ahem, ""Resting bitch face""
Rat dogs were originally bred for traits useful for humans -- hunting rats and mice. The yipping is just barking. I don't know why dogs were bred to bark, but they were. Perhaps because it's a useful signal when dogs are bred to guard or hunt.

Huh. I've always thought about that as the 'trying to get away with it' expression.   We had a dog who could lift one eyebrow consistently. He actually was the canine equivalent of a supergenius; we never figured out how he did some of what he did. Our next dog was, thankfully, dumb as a box of bricks.
Keep reading.
Still not a freaky as the cat poop parasite.
I get that it's a joke, but domesticated cats retain kitten behaviours into adulthood that wild or completely feral cats discard. Purely to manipulate the hoomans. FWIW, cats don't meow to each other either. It's how they speak to their hoomans.

It's great to see Rob's work on the site again. Since being introduced to After On (the podcast, and then the book), I've been a fan of Rob's.
Depends on how long term you mean. Being vaporized inside the outer layers of the red giant sun doesn't really sound ""fine"" to me.
You mean Nivea SPF-Infinite won’t help?
If by then we haven't created a Dyson sphere around the sun humanity deserves it's extinction.
I'd like to see a Dyson sphere that can contain an expanding red giant. Moving the Earth to a safer orbit seems more likely.
Well at least you won't get a tan while being vaporized.
Rob, the link under 'a while' in the first paragraph isn't working. Editor Moonshark says: Oops, Moonshark so excited to learn about extinction of humanity that Moonshark paste in CMS link and not front page link. Moonshark make fix now!
Earth would be uninhabitable a billion years before sun reached that phase. It doesn't matter though. We will cause our own extinction long long before.
we need to respect and manage our actions in regard to nature. But one day, one day our tech will outstrip nature. On that day... revenge.
I give it at most 10 years.
That's a relief. I don't have to worry about retirement.
Barring an asteroid strike of epic proportions, or a GRB homo sapien sapien will be around for a while. Humans are like cockroaches, rats, et al. Adaptive generalists. Civilization? I don't think it will be around the whole time. Converting ever larger and larger percentages of the global ecosystem to human production will see to that. I personally doubt the current globally connected world economy will make it another hundred years. I hope I'm wrong. Post civilization small bands of humanity will still be able to eke out enough resources from the wreckage to eke out a meager living. You can read all about it in Fates upcoming post apocalyptic novel.
Making the assumption that humanity lasts that long, and that the red giant phase of our sun is roughly as far away as we expect, that shouldn't be a problem. It might be for any successors, though.
Sooner or later, meaty humans will be toast, one way or another. And I don't think our extinction will be that much of a significant event. I mean, it makes no sense that our arrival would somehow signal the last stop in the evolutionary process. It does make sense that we would have great input into the future evolution of the hominid line, and I think we will. The key differentiator we bring into biology is human-level intelligence. So what I would like to see though is the survival of intelligence. The survival of mind. And to that extent, a synthetic mind, of the robotic variety for example, would be just as good and probably better. As long as mind survives, everything is possible, including the re-creation of biological hominids should that become necessary for whatever reason (eg satisfying the archaeological curiosity of future beings).

I was thinking 100-200. 10 would be sub-optimal. I want to get old enough to have nothing better to do but feed ducks at the park
The ball of iron and silicon we call our planet will be fine. If you're talking about the greenish scum on the surface that we call nature, it will adapt. If you mean civilization, that is much more fragile.
End of civilization is a few skipped meals, a power outage, and no running water, away. It is incredibly fragile.
Unless you are some kind of Gaia Deist, the earth or doesn't need saving - as said it well be here, and when it is gone it won't care. The part of earth's ecosystem that can self reflect may have members that care. It is our morality and values that we are projecting to say we want a rich ecosystem that was more like before human population exploded. I think that is a good idea for multiple reasons (Aesthetic, land ethic, risk, etc), but it is us, humans that are setting that moral compass.
Great podcast and really great episode! Listened to it already on the After On podcast. The After On podcast is my #1 in depth podcast I listen to.
They propose a doomsday scenario is inevitable based on these facts: - As technology advances, increasingly more devastating weapons perpetually become more accessible. So given sufficient timespan, every raving nutjob will have access to [hydrogen bombs, super bio weapons, assassination drones, etc]. - The potential of offensive weapons is usually asymmetrical - ie, it is much easier to set off a hydrogen bomb, release a super bio weapon, or target a drone on an airplane than it is defend against it. They do not speculate about a solution to this problem - they don't seem to see one. I believe there is a solution that is as inevitable as the problem. Which is total analyzed surveillance. The default assumption regarding surveillance might be that, as these kind of attacks escalate, governments will continue to annex increasing surveillance abilities to protect us from these threats. That requires political compliance. While most governments can probably easily obtain said compliance, I don't think this surveillance scenario is necessary. I see this more as the inevitable consequence of the march of technology. Soon, we will have automated manufacturing of – or even self-replicating – miniature spybots. Mobile, like ants, flies, mosquitos, fleas, bacteria. Maybe even difficult to distinguish from their natural brethren. In every building, on every communication device, on every person. In droves. Disposable. Self-replacing. Networked. Smart enough to record information and leave a faraday cage to transmit... in rotation, so not a second is missed. Not owned or controlled by one actor - every person, device, and location would be simultaneously monitored by many governments, large corporations, institutions, political factions, wealthy individuals... utter, redundant surveillance. As the cost of performing such surveillance falls to near 0 and whoever has it first [through x'th] is abusing it, like spy agencies, well-meaning groups will replicate the total surveillance and make it public to end the asymmetric control allowed by the initial information asymmetry. And no action by any human will ever be private again. On the plus side, AI's watching everybody will inform law enforcement before anyone sets off their doomsday device. It would likely largely end murder and corruption. On the downside, it is the most utter end to privacy imaginable. From birth to death, not a moment of existence would not be recorded, analyzed by AI, indexed, searchable, and available to countless parties, if not simply public. It's impossible to predict the consequences on humanity of living that way.
So, Gort, then?

FTFY
Great interview
All of the literature I've read suggests the Dyson sphere gets built *after* the sun cools down from its red giant phase and becomes a white dwarf. Our problem is surviving the red giant phase, and gathering enough material to build the sphere. Presumably that means saving material from the rocky planets and the asteroid belt before the sun eats them or blows them away.
Eh, for the 80% of the population that lives on the coasts in the G-20 countries, maybe. Everyone else will just move 20-40 miles to the nearest convenient farm and continue on with civilization as it was in the late 19th century.
(Dogbert voice) Basically anything that gets rid of humanity, is fine by me. (/Dogbert voice) On a slightly more serious note, look at the chaos caused by Katrina (the hurricane, not the band) while the water was bad, the lack of power caused the humans there to lose their minds and turn on each other/loot/pillage/etc. Civilization is held together by access to food and electricity. Remove either one for longer than a few days and watch the carnage ensue.
You first. That screen name. When is the next race? And where?
Care is needed, both within scientific endeavour, and making sure one won't be compared to those wise people who claimed travelling faster than 30mph on a locomotive would result in asphyxiation.
If you get the fire hotter than the blazes of hell I think she could hit 88 mph.
I think you'll find it much easier if you drop the difficulty a bit. If ghandi starts kicking off, nuke him first.

Aggro Ghandi was an unsigned integer overflow bug, right? 0 - 1 = 254
As a triathlete I hope you can run really fast when that 80% of the population comes looking for food. And a fair number may not limit themselves to vegetarianism after a week or two without food I'm guessing. =:-O

I can think of few of my old university lectures that I wouldn't mind being given a one way trip into space. Not sure they meant that kind of academic payload. Last edited by Albino_Boo on Tue Jun 18, 2019 1:22 am
When describing how close a complex technical system is to final configuration a statement that says ""nearly final flight configuration"" has more credibility IMO than ""97% flight like"". The latter just leads one to question how the 97% figure was derived (by mass, by volume, by component count, by component manufacturing lead time etc) and then question why a specific numeric value was even derived and disclosed in the first place instead of an expected time frame. Management by magic numbers makes me uneasy. In fact 23.8% more uneasy/s (see how stupid it sounds?) That being said I wish Firefly good luck in their first flight. More competition is a good thing.
Reaver engines eh? I mean, I think about the show everytime I see this company, but I didn't know they -did-base themselves on the show. That's... pretty sweet.
Mixed emotions on this. Nice to see STEM getting a chance for a free ride, but are the ""vanity"" payloads going to be in a stable orbit - contributing to orbital cruft - or will their orbits decay over a relatively short period of time. EDIT: Thanks for the answers to this one, that the orbits will decay. Also amusing to see the tall tank right next to the engine stand, while the two off to the left are at a safe (?) distance. Not knowing what is in the tanks - but knowing that the people who designed the system have thought it through - leaves me to idly speculate on why the tanks are placed the way they are.

As I recall, all of the Reaver engines were horrible smoke-pots. Which I guess will happen when all of your maintainers are murderous rage monkeys. But they did operate a pretty successful siege fleet around their home planet, so there's that record of successful performance to call out in the marketing literature. Fly on, Firefly, fly on.
It's a 300km circular orbit. The nominal unpowered decay time is only a month. https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/d ... rblife.htm
They’re going to a 300km orbit. Decay time is months.
Could simply be the angle of the shot combined with a telephoto lens makes the tank look a lot closer to the test stand than it actually is.
If that test stand is built like any other test stand, that tall one is chemical fire suppressant.
I am suffering rocket report withdrawal.
Coal rollers of the future. IIRC the reavers overdrove their engines spewing radiactive waste. It is hard to represent that visually so ugly black smoke was the metaphor.
I told my wife I wanted either a Viking funeral or to be cremated and sent into space. She said both are too expensive. This, however, would fit the bill but their timetable is far more aggressive than mine...
Far more impressive a test than ARCA's steam rocket. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmhsMBKjMwc Last edited by Tfargo04 on Mon Jun 17, 2019 11:43 am
The two far away tanks on the left have flat ends, so they're probably unpressurized RP-1. That would leave the short tank on the right for oxygen.
Can I send my mother-in-law as an experiment - - ""Hypothesis that no one in space can hear her nag""?
Yeah sure, but if you're wrong she'll be directly overhead every 90 minutes.
Only for a few months, then she'll burn up on re-entry.
And now we see the real reason let out of the bag.
Interesting inclination. I wonder who the commercial customer is at this inclination/altitude.
Nothing too interesting about it. Looks like a typical Sun-synchronous orbit.
One of the more puzzling unexplored aspects of the Reavers, to me anyway, is just how they manage to maintain and operate spaceships. I have a hard time imagining them calmly debugging and fixing problems rather than going at the engine like Basil Fawlty at his car.
Does it matter? They count up the components and derive a % from it. By mass or volume would be weird and arbitrary but whatever, it's just an internal yardstick they can execute against. I do not see how lead time flows into a %? A pure component count seems rather sensible. Whatever the case, it is exactly as wishy washy as ""nearly final"". I can wonder the exact same things about nearly final.
Do you think we will have a massive 2 week report this Friday? With next 6 launches at the end?
We have some simulation footage of this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvvsw21PgIk
It is common for someone who is trying to sound credible and authoritative to a lay audience to throw out some number for something not compatible with quantifiable analysis, at least in a generally used or widely accepted manner. Bonus points for using 2 or 3 significant digits. This is common in advertising for example (""New Tide gets your clothes 27% softer""). This is probably effective for impressing a lay audience and even short circuiting debate by sounding like there is some serious analysis behind it but throw some definitive sounding bogus number to a group of engineers, or STEM folks in general, and its like tossing chum in shark infested waters - generates a lot more close attention than it avoids.

We were told to do that recently on a project I’m working on. The customer paid us to do “90%” of the mechanical and electrical engineering work, before they signed off on the full project. That led to a mockery of all following meetings as the engineers kept asking the PMs if they had done enough work.
There was a story about Seymour Cray setting up Cray Computers after leaving CDC. He was told he absolutely needed a business plan. The plan he wrote was, in its entirety, something along the line of ""company goal: build the world's fastest supercomputer within 5 years. First year plan - achieve 20% of company goal"".
The ride on the Firefly might be free, but they want a flight-qualified dispenser (or fixed mount) and that's a $50k sort of thing. It's entirely possible to build the satellite in your garage for a few thousand bucks in parts, and copious free labor, but the dispenser is going to be a challenge. It's gotta be 3-27U - no 10x10x10 cubes. FCC licensing might also be a challenge, unless you already happened to have done that and are just switching to a new ride. They don't say if you need to do any environmental testing (vibe, thermal). Non-technical payloads might be the best bet - put it in a boltable package and it rides up and down with the LV. ""Nontechnical payloads would be things like your child’s artwork or an heirloom."" This might be a good opportunity if you've already gone through the hoops for another launch, have your dispenser, etc. and your other launch (viz ELaNa XX on Virgin Orbital/VOX) keeps slipping, and you want to ""get that sucker into space"" without paying $350k to a broker like Spaceflight.
But perhaps not your wife's schedule. Would your cremains be ""ready to ship"" in September? If she, like you, is a rocket launch geek (why else would you be reading and commenting), you might want to carefully examine any offers to ""honey, let's go zip-lining"" or ""Have you considered BASE-jumping?"" - any new insurance policies? (Sniff)""My husband's dying wish was to be cremated and sent into space. It is a comfort in this time of sadness that I could help him achieve that goal.""
Indeed - good luck and goode spede... As for how one measures it.. Allow me to introduce the concept of ""Earned Value Management"" which is pervasive (and required) at NASA - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management Basically, you break your entire project schedule down into work packages of reasonable granularity, assign a value to each one of them, and add up the values of the packages that are complete. Works great if you know a priori the expected cost or value of each work package, which is easy if you've done it before. It works fairly well for construction - if you're building 100 houses, you probably have built houses before, so you know how much it costs to do ""foundation"", ""framing"", etc. For ""one of a kind, never been done before"" let's build a multi-instrument spacecraft to go to Europa - maybe not as well.
Um, I mean... Yes, this is best suited to small orgs (academic, gov research, etc) who were already planning to put something into space and now can get the booster part of their mission for free.
Hindenburg.... Yes, not fair. But it will be brought up. If I were even remotely interested in a hydrogen vehicle, the weaknesses here would give me pause. Not so much the explosion - any technology storing large amounts of energy can have issues when that energy gets unstored rapidly (Rapid Unscheduled Energy Emission, nah, won't go there) but the problem of a very limited supply chain. Even if a major oil refinery or oil tanker blows up, supply isn't immediately imperiled. Yes, it's a chicken and egg issue but that is where the industry is at.
Nuclear fusion Hydrogen is the energy of the future and always will be.
I honestly don't see hydrogen as a viable fuel when it takes energy to extract it in the first place, namely more energy than one gets from the hydrogen itself. Batteries seem like the future to me. The ""long exhaust pipe"" problem is real there, but the remedy of steadily investing in carbon neutral power plants resolves that.
I would prefer more R&D into (kinda ironically) carbon-neutral use of methane.
Realistically, for a multitude of uses, some kind of fuel is needed for various energy purposes with air travel among the largest. That said, hydrogen isn't it.
The long term method is solar / wind electricity driving electrolysis from water. The question with that approach is whether or not using hydrogen as the storage medium is any better than a 'direct' storage device like a battery. I (and lots of other people) are betting on the battery. But you can pipe hydrogen (subject to a buttload of little annoying technical problems) and you can liquify hydrogen (subject to even more technical problems and some little details about energy efficiency). Both advantages may be useful in some applications (first stage rocket boosters, for example) but likely not be a major factor in the change from a petrochemical based energy economy.

The Laws of Thermodynamics say any fuel releases less energy than what's put into creating it. The question is whether the energy spent in production could be better used in another more direct way.
While true, I'm curious as to the efficiency of this vs some other method of storage. My gut feeling is that it wouldn't come out ahead.
I see a renewable source of hydrocarbon fuel to be the longest term alternative for many uses of fuel today. Capturing carbon from the atmosphere and combining with hydrogen into methane is an active point of research and has been for decades. Robert Zubrin, whose Mars Direct profile is more or less the backbone for every planned manned Mars mission today, was talking about the technology 30 years ago. More recently the US Navy has been working on extracting CO2 and hydrogen from seawater to produce methane (to eventually process into jet fuel).
Hydrogen fuel....it's the bomb! /j
I see an energy Boom in the making
You're right about incommensurability. Hydrogen works; neither kind of fusion will work commercially. Hydrogen is being produced and used at industrial scales today. Fusion, hot or cold, is still at the lab experiment stage and has been stuck there forever. It'll never be commercially viable for a whole bunch of reasons, not least wind and solar.
It takes energy to extract oil and coal. It takes energy to drive electric generators, followed by losses in transmission, charging and discharging of batteries. Hydrogen is an energy carrier. So is oil, so is a battery. The issue is not just overall efficiency. For instance, if you can produce hydrogen using electrical capacity that would otherwise be wasted, it may (or not) be more economical than building battery farms or pumped storage facilities. That has to be established. If fusion reactors ever come on stream, if wind power continues to grow, we do have the issue of what to do with excess capacity at times of low demand. If your wind turbine is being cut back 50% because supply exceeds demand, and this means you can pump water or electrolyse it, the issue becomes one of cost of storage per kWH, not overall efficiency, because your additional generation capacity is free - or in the case of a fusion reactor which may not really throttle, less than free because otherwise you have some kind of cost of load dumping. To take a hypothetical, suppose we have a 14kWH battery using existing technology which can be charged and discharged 1000 times. That means the battery cost is amortised over 14000kWH. If the amortised cost of the plant for pumping and storing hydrogen sufficient to produce that much energy is significantly less than that of the battery, hydrogen works. If it is greater, it doesn't. Of course it depends on the technology of the day and this isn't a fixed target. For instance, I have a 1922 paper that demonstrates that turbo-electric drive for ships is not economical compared to geared turbines, both in fuel consumption, and in the loss of carrying capacity due to the added weight. That was certainly true in 1922. But then the big Diesel engines became available. They were much heavier than turbines. They were more expensive. But they used a staggering 70% less fuel, and Diesel-electric drives pushed the advantage back to electric drive again. It's entirely possible we see the same kind of back and forth with batteries, hydrogen, and even other storage means. It seems to me entirely right that the winner is not decided in advance, because it implies an ability to predict the future - which may be quite wrong.
Fission was once and will be again the future of energy generation, and hydrogen complements it well, possibly in a direct thermochemical cycle.
Never is an awful long time. The potential of fusion is huge, so they will keep investigating it, and I wouldn't discount so quickly any breakthrough making it easier to maintain the plasma in the future.
If they'd called it Freedom Fuel instead, they'd already be rolling in subsidies.
Hydrogen isn't a fuel. It's a battery. And like a battery, it costs energy to produce and transport. Think of how much energy was made to build the battery, how much power is lost in charging and discharging it. They're only about 90% efficient, and if you're charging them from the grid, from a remote power plant, you might be losing 50% of the power to transmission, inversion, and transforming. And the battery degrades, so you need to depreciate all of that to cover it's replacement. Also, in the case of an EV, your range is still largely a function of the weight of the fuel - the batteries. The motors are a fixed energy cost, but are light. For a fuel cell, it's the reverse - the motor (the fuel cell stack) is heavy, but the fuel is light. So for something like a semi, the lower weight of the fuel means that you expend less fuel to pay for carrying the fuel. There's some Tsiolkovsky rocket equation application here. The cost of getting a payload to orbit is largely a function of the mass of the fuel and the energy it contains. For a battery EV, getting 1000 mile range is virtually impossible. For a fuel cell, it's pretty easy. Just put more hydrogen in it. The question is how key that 1000 mile range is to the utility of the vehicle. For a passenger vehicle, not so much. For a long haul truck, pretty key. By comparison, think of how CA is approaching this. Southern CA has a hydrogen pipeline, so the transmission costs and losses are minimal. We can extract the hydrogen from water using the massive amount of excess solar/wind power we produce above demand (4 TWh last year, and growing). So the energy used to produce the hydrogen costs nothing - it was energy we were going to dump anyway because there was zero demand for it and no other way to store it. So, we put it in a battery - the hydrogen, and we can send it where it's needed almost for free. Now, in many cases the best place to extract that would be right where it was generated, because that's where the grid infrastructure is, so put a reversible fuel cell right at the turbine/solar array, and have it make hydrogen when demand for power is met, and have it produce power at night, etc. Or, that same system can fuel fuel cells closer to the demand side, reduce the grid management, transmission losses, inversions, costs etc. You'll still have the fuel cell losses but we can make choices here. We can also put it in vehicles like the fuel cell drayage rigs out of Port of LA/LB, buses, trains, airplanes, etc. Consider that we put payloads in orbit using hydrogen, but not batteries. The energy/weight ratio for hydrogen is very good - massive better than batteries. That's not to say that hydrogen beats batteries across the board, but there's infrastructure we can build to help either, and there's an inflection point where one makes more sense than another. The answer of course will be both.
When they find out how to burn water and the gasoline car is gone When an airplane flies without any fuel and a satellite heats our homes One of these days when the air clears up and the sun comes shinin' through We'll all be drinkin' that free Bubbleup And eatin' that rainbow stew Eatin ' rainbow stew with a silver spoon Underneath that sky of blue We'll all be drinkin' that free Bubbleup And eatin' that rainbow stew Written by the late, great Merle Haggard
Say it with me: hydrogen isn't a fuel, it's an energy transfer medium, much like electricity. It's how you get energy from the place it's generated to the place it's used. You carry it in pipes or tankers, while electricity is carried in cables, but they both have basically the same use cases. When considering hydrogen, the question is ""what are its advantages over cables and batteries?"", since those are its actual competition.
I'm betting on the battery for vehicles, for sure. For cyclical storage (for storing excess solar energy during the day for use at night) there are a number of choices. LNG is probably not in the cards, but CNG (CH4) would not be too difficult and it has around 42% the energy density of LNG. The best solution would be some sort of catalyzed room-temperature liquid... then the sky would be the limit in terms of storage. I really dislike the idea of using Hydrogen for vehicle use... the cycle is too complex and a complete refactoring of commercial refueling stations would be needed, whereas a battery solution for vehicle use does not need anywhere near as many commercial charging stations. -Matt
During LeMans last night, the commentators said that the ACO has a work group going to bring hydrogen fueled vehicles to the race in 2025. They had a long discussion about it and the aspect of safety was brought up. A few of the fuel manufacturers seems to be on board with it, one of them being Shell UK and the other Total along with a few of the manufacturers. Toyota being one name brought up, but I'd wager that a few European companies might start swinging that way. They did talk about China a bit but I missed that part of it but China is a market that may show interest in hydrogen technology. There are lot of pros and cons but it appears that the cost with battery technology and the life span of a battery life. The whole gauntlet associated with it is starting to come under fire.
Well, it is. But refineries have the benefit of a large enough scale that you don't notice them much. When CA refineries go down, our gas prices jump upwards of $1/gal. We don't really see shortages because the price change triggers the arbitrage market to act - they sell stored supply. Hydrogen would see exactly the same dynamics as it scales. Actually, it would be better for hydrogen since you can produce it locally. A reversible fuel cell stack as a secondary system to a solar/wind array (with grid as tertiary) would be perfect for a lot of local applications like farms, small towns, schools/universities etc. which could be microgridded. Fleet enterprises could produce it locally.
Parts of Norway have up to 4000 millimeters (156 inches) of rain per year. There are literally thousands of freshwater lakes and fjords. The average precipitation is increasing considerable due to climate change. Don't worry, Norway will not become a desert due to the hydrogen Nel is making.
I think what steers these conversations the wrong way is the framing of ""electric vehicles vs. hydrogen vehicles"" when it's really ""battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles"". Most hydrogen vehicles use fuel cells and thus electric motors for propulsion, and the end state is hydrogen production via electrolysis powered by renewables, so the overall cycle is still electrical energy-> chemical energy-> electrical energy for both BEVs and FCEVs, it's just that the first conversion happens onboard a BEV but exterior to the FCEV. Additionally, __there is no need to choose between BEVs and FCEVs at the society level__. Just like how CNG, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil vehicles exist simultaneously for fossil fuel vehicles, BEVs and FCEVs can coexist. There are advantages for BEVs (cycle efficiency), and there are advantages for FCEVs (electricity demand shifting).
If you're using the batteries to store energy, that's fine, but batteries alone aren't going to cut the energy needs of the future. They can augment and help balance energy delivery. Much of the trouble is that folks seem to be thinking of ""THE thing"" for the future. It's never been 100% ONE thing that provides power, so what the future holds is a variety of approaches that works best for that region and/or use. Industrial batteries have their place in that, of course, but not as a direct source of energy generation (which is what hydrogen would be used for - if not burned to move things, then used to generate energy in other ways). But hydrogen is hugely fraught safety-wise. It's one thing to have trained professionals dealing with it. It's quite another to have the general public messing around with it. Add to that the storage issues and the legitimate question of whether or not another source of energy (be it direct or indirect) than hydrogen would be better in the long-run is one to consider. Aircraft are the only thing I can think of which can legitimately benefit from a very high energy density fuel like hydrogen. But the storage tanks would be very heavy, and the fuel efficiency per passenger would suck out loud due to flying a heavier aircraft. Maybe the efficiency is high enough to offset that, but still, hydrogen is funny stuff with respect to storage and handling (not to mention how it's made can add a carbon cost, too). In that respect, maybe we can find a less caustic, lower-carbon emitting formula and develop more efficient engines. Personally, despite its excellent energy density (better than jet fuel) I see more issues using hydrogen for aircraft (of any kind) than I do, say, methane, LNG or propane, all of which are easier to handle and have better energy density than jet fuel. Unless there's a breakthrough in how hydrogen can be stored and handled (which is always a possibility given the research into metamaterials), it might be better to go with a compromise of substantially lower carbon emissions (but still carbon emitting) for safety and technical reasons than using hydrogen. There may come a time when hydrogen is the go-to fuel source. But my sense is that there are still a lot of bugs in that system that need to be chased down and dealt with before rushing to embrace it.
Hydrogen will never work for aircraft (other than very short haul), because you need ~15x the mass of the hydrogen for the tankage. The volume of the tanks means they would be difficult to package into the wings. It makes far more sense to make synthetic liquid jet fuel for aviation.
If you combine the hydrogen with carbon into long chain molecules, then it is a liquid at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure. That way it can be distributed in existing infrastructure and burned in regular unmodified IC engines. I think I should patent that and do a start-up and IPO...
First of all, I’d like to see anywhere in the developed world (or anywhere at all really) where you lose 50% of the electrical energy to transmission losses. Typically, a normal grid has between 4-8% transmission losses power plant to wall socket. As for your other points, a whole lot of your efficiency argument goes out the window when considering that hydrogen infrastructure needs to be built out and is in many ways just duplicating the function of the electrical grid (transferring energy from A to B). Not only does it have noticeable transmission losses as well but it’s also much less flexible as there a way fewer uses for natural gas than for electrical power.
It exists, and is called Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC). The current research is about controlling exact extraction/conversion rates for use with both direct hydrogen engines and fuel cells. Better paper
SoCal is currently, right now, doing both. Consumer vehicles are batteries. Commercial are increasingly fuel cell, for the very reasons stated in my (mysteriously) downrated comment above. For many commercial applications the downtime to recharge is too expensive. For consumers, we mostly use our cars an hour or two per day, so if it spends 12 hours charging, it's not a problem so long as the 12 hours is conveniently distributed. But a drayage rig is basically in use 24/7. It hauls a full container from the port to a distribution center, and hauls an empty back, drops it off, grabs another full container, and repeats, constantly, changing drivers through shifts. There's not enough downtime to charge, and owning 2x as many rigs simply for half of them to sit idle charging doesn't work. But as fuel cell powered, they can stay in continuous operation. Refueling is fast, it happens in a central location so the pipeline just needs to go there. Buses can use batteries, but it depends a bit on how they're used. There are some routes where batteries wouldn't work. Long haul trucks are tricky. Since there are rules on how many hours a driver can operate, it creates a lot of free time for charging. But if those trucks are automated, then they can run 24/7 and hydrogen becomes a lost more attractive. Don't underestimate how much benefit there is from getting produce across country in a day or two less time. Other vehicles - airport service vehicles, etc. all have use cases that may favor hydrogen over batteries. It's going to be both.
Since the hydrogen fuel cell cycle uses about 3x as much energy per mile as battery electric, it's weird that fuel cell advocates often roll out grid issues as a downside of BEVs. Ultimately, with fuel cells stacks costing more than a long-range battery and not lasting nearly as long, it will be economics that keeps hydrogen from being more than a niche in transportation. Few fleet managers will be willing to pay 3x as much for fuel in exchange for quicker fill-ups.
batteries and renewable sources and loads are so simple(for all intents and purposes relative to consumers) just get a battery, a pair of wires, and a load and boom, done. i found out how to do that back when i was like 7 destroying toys and stuff whenever those components reach a low enough price, it will simply blowup in adoption, people will realize how amazing it is to be energy self sufficient, batteries will get thrown somewhere and recycled and that'd be it, its quiet, bothers no one, needs no one(sun will always* be there) and can scale up and down as much as needed
How do I recharge my hydrogen when it gets low? If it gets consumed during use, it's a fuel. Maybe you could make the argument that the tank is a battery? That still sounds stupid to me though.
With proper vehicle design (eg, lifting body) it can be accommodated and total mass (tank + LH2) might be similar or even lower. Put simply, LH2 is a good fuel for aviation in the same sense it's a good fuel rocket upper stages: high Isp and we don't care too much about TWR.
The case of demand shifting isn't so simple. Electrolysis hardware is expensive and availability dependent production increases that by several fold. Compared to other forms of electricity shifting (various grid storage, domestic storage, availability dependent charging of BEV) it's not when/if H2 production for FCEV will be a player.
Totally false. I actually did the calculations for hydrogen driven airplanes some 10 years ago ... it works suprisingly well and it would actually make those airplanes perform better (longer range with lower take-off weight). The only thing that would need to change is that the tanks can no langer be in the wings. Due to their sheer size they would have to be in the cargo hold. They would actually occupy about 30% of the cargo hold of a B737/A320.
Good job.
I really wish actors/actresses who aren't medically trained would not abuse their platform to push anti-science nonsense and legislation.
Good for NY and CA. We need to get rid of non-medical exemptions here in WA, too.
And Senators.
True, but overall there was a significant net gain in vaccination coverage, boosting it up into the mid-90% range where herd immunity is effective. There were never that many exemptions to begin with, and there still aren't, although their absolute numbers have gone up. I believe the state medical board will be pursuing licensing review, or at least investigations, of doctors writing an inordinate number of exemptions. As they should. This is far outside sanctioned medical practice.
It would be a lot better if that actually said 'anyone' tbh. Leave medical decisions to medical professionals.
Ms. Biel and Mr. Kennedy are fucking shit up. Isn't there some way to take their goddamn money?

It’s actually frightening how stupid she is. She’s worried about a friend’s child who apparently has a legit medical exemption need. By campaigning against laws like this she’s actually putting that child in more danger. The legit medical exemption people need everyone else to do their part to be safe. There’s just no measuring celebrity stupidity sometimes.
They need to also go after doctors making false medical exemptions.
Democracy - the least bad government we have.
If we're being honest, senators who are medically trained don't have the best track record either.
Weak immune system would be another reason.
something something Promote the General Welfare something something. End of story.
Well, CA’s new bill would be a good start. It sets up state review of all “medical” exemptions to determine if they’re valid, and can revoke invalid ones. As a doctor I imagine it’d be hard to keep your business if it’s built on granting easy-to-get “medical” exemptions and your exemptions start getting revoked...

I'm basically going to reiterate the same thing because it's that freaking important and people sometimes miss posts anyway. Frankly, it's rather misleading when people end with just ""but the number of medical exemptions tripled"" because the overall vaccination rate was still a net success. I do wish Ars would include that particular snippet, because we've had quite a few people in previous articles home in on that and try to hammer it as if it proved that eliminating non-medical exemptions is useless. And just as Six said, banning non-medical exemptions will make doctors who issue too many exemptions stick out, making it easier to weed out unscrupulous doctors.

You still have to have some semblance of an immune system to fight the dead or weakened virus in vaccines. If you don't have even that, you're completely SOL.
I’ve been calling these folks the “wave 2” anti-vaxxers, folks who try to disassociate with the blunt vaccines-are-poisons crowd and sound like they’re just raising reasonable concerns (so their anti-vax garbage might succeed through sealioning).
Doctors issue the exemptions after an examination. Parents can request it, but doctors must ultimately determine whether an exemption should be issued. If there's an unscrupulous doc who's issuing medical exemptions willy-nilly, it will come up in the statistics and then the state can investigate.
Blood tests actually are pretty good at determining this.
There are a number of known diagnoses that result in being severely immunocompromised. This is not some guesswork - it's solid science (which should also make it easy to smack down the few doctors abusing the system for wrong exemptions. It's quite a simple list of when they can issue them.

I really liked an idea floated during the Obamacare debate to have some kind of oversight committee that would make these kinds of things happen. Reasonable pricing, banning of unreasonably priced products, clamping down on dumb stuff, etc.
It's just a ploy by Big Pharma to sell more vaccines. /s, in case it wasn't bloody obvious. In all seriousness, I hope they are able to contain it.
This is the real world consequence of a breakdown of society. There are areas where even ring vaccination has failed because people are constantly forced to move by warfare and medical teams are unable to deliver vaccines so the rings never get established.
I wonder if they can vaccinate the outlying areas to keep the contagion contained, if vaccination is indeed nearly impossible due to lack of cooperation by the general populace
I'm surprised its taken this long. Areas of Africa are so ripe for major public health issues given all the civil unrest and political instability and anti-science mentality.
Are you talking about America? 'Cause it sounds like your talking about America....
That could easily describe several regions of the US, especially the ""anti-science mentality"".
Substitute ""disease flare-ups"" with ""opioid abuse flare-ups"" and you're getting pretty close.
I dont think this situation is joke worthy - it is fucking terrifying. This has the potential to become a major crisis.

Look at the lethality rate. Roughly 2/3 of those who caught the disease died from it in this case. TB seems to be 10-12%, even if it's more prevalent. We put more effort into stopping it because if it did outbreak, there would be a massive amount of deaths. Edit: It's also just scarier. Last edited by nehinks on Thu Jun 13, 2019 1:53 pm
It’s the potential. Ebola has a 50% or higher mortality rate in Africa, and even with the full resources of a modernized country like America, the mortality rate from an outbreak here would still likely be 30% or more. And until just a few months ago, there was no Ebola vaccine. We live in a world where millions of people move from one continent to another every day, in many cases reaching their destination before they would become symptomatic. Keeping that Ebola outbreak limited to 11,000 people and one continent was an incredible achievement that required substantial international resources. Ebola transmission would be slowed in industrialized countries with comprehensive sanitation systems, but containment has still been the only way of preventing a global pandemic. Attitudes may change now that there is finally an Ebola vaccine, but only once vaccination becomes widespread and is well demonstrated as effective long term against the disease. The first major vaccine use results were just published two months ago. It’ll take more to convince people we’ve finally gotten the solution down.
Again, not the time to make jokes about human suffering on a continent that has severe structural problems due to centuries of European imperialism. This outbreak is NOT evidence of nature striking back: the proximate cause is the war in the Congo, which suffered especially hard under Belgium's especially brutal rule.
The worrying part is the more it spreads from country to country there is a higher risk of mutations happening to the virus. Especially if it reaches different zones with different conditions.
You're right of course but as others have said, what is treated as news and the prominence attached to it doesn't always stand up to rational analysis. A slow accumulation off anything will never quite get the coverage it should. For what it's worth, I think a big part of the Ebola coverage was that, until recently, there was no effective vaccine and even with treatment the mortality rate was (and I think still is) very high. So, and this may be unfair, the coverage struck me as having a large element of fear and what if it spread to us. My impression is that coverage of this outbreak has been much lower key and less extensive compared to the last outbreak. There may be other differences, but my feeling is that the existence of the vaccine is a big factor in that, as it's no longer quite as scary to us (as awful as it still is).
We need Will Smith.
It's not mistrust, it's robbery. The health care workers dealing with Ebola are well paid and that money attracts violence. The UK government is refusing to say how much it spends for that very reason Last edited by Albino_Boo on Thu Jun 13, 2019 2:31 pm
Familiar with that and got the ref the first time but, a humanitarian crisis is brewing and that old joke isn't really funny in this context.
The media does tend to cover Ebola somewhat disproportionately compared to other diseases. I usually assume it's because a hemorrhagic fever is substantially more gruesome and alarming than something Western media considers a ""routine"" infection like the flu. There is possibly also some aspect of poverty porn involved, and/or a general motivation to sow fear of brown people depending on the media outlet in question. It should be viewed more as a failure of civilization. Ebola is more treatable than the media makes it sound, and it actually can be contained with basic safety equipment and protocols: in the image you see they use face shields and covers, not fully-enclosed hazmat suits. MSF personnel and other aid organizations are usually in the area to treat the patients and very rarely contract the disease themselves. But because its animal reservoirs exist in regions with unstable governments and unreliable access to treatment resources, the mortality rate is statistically quite high.
centuries of European imperialism What? Africa was mostly ignored till the late 19th century outside of buying slaves from the various African coastal kingdoms. It was the scramble for Africa from 1880 till the start of WW1 when Africa was colonised.
""If it bleeds, it leads"". Ebola is easier to sensationalize than boring old diseases like malaria and influenza.
""We got the bubble-headed bleach blonde, comes on at 5, She can tell ya bout the plane crash with a gleam in her eye, It's interesting when people die...give us dirty laundry. ....""
There is no ""approved"" vaccine for Ebola. There is an experimental vaccine discussed in ""A ""Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Ebola Vaccine"" thats reportedly 97% effective. I don't know how far away they are from a vaccine that will used routinely in a non-emegency regimen. This outbreak could be a motivator to move faster...

While I tend to enjoy the puns in ars articles, on an article (indirectly) about somebody's death they feel somewhat tasteless. Just my two cents.
Second paragraph filled with hilarious puns? ""I bet this was written by Beth...yep."" I crack up every time I read one of her articles.
I know there's been a lack of Beth punny articles lately, but one about people dying? That's pretty crappy. I think you should clear the air here.
What a shitty way to die...
Well that is one shitty outcome.
Yeah, I know who wrote this one.
Party pooper
Slightly off topic, but I'd read a novel by Beth Mole if it was filled with her puns. Maybe a humorous scifi novel about biotech gone awry.
If the puns aren't pushed out regularly, they tend to get backed up.
Beth is the best. An article about poop and death was always going to be a tasteless one.
To the downdingers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M
Beth delivers again. I am not disappointed Spoiler: show
This one really hit the fan!
The researchers really need to come up with better methods for these oral stool supplements. None of these are remotely near appetizing, if you know how the poo food is being prepared...
I don't think the delivery methodology is the only unappealing aspect of this procedure.
Fecal transplants are being tested/used for so many things. C diff infection. auto immune diseases, there's even interest in it's use in bone marrow transplant/leukemia as an adjuvant to making chemo more effective. Methods of delivery varies, and the source could be just a family member with no testing/screening done (FMT can be done at home with a blender, strain, and empty gel caps...sorry for that image) or the stool could come from companies that bank samples from healthy donors that are checked regularly. With so little information provided by the FDA, this is them basically saying someone died because they did a thing.
""Someone died"", etc.... Nothing confronts mortality better than humor.
I have to say I am interested in the potential of gut flora transplants but this illustrates why you REALLY dont want to be an early adopter on elective medical procedures.
I read the title and got as far as ""Killer Poop"" and knew this was a Beth article.
The long-term solution would be to collect samples from donors, isolate the various bacterial strains, sequence them to identify non-dangerous varieties, and build an ideal mix for transplant. The obvious downside to this is the time and cost required, the less obvious downside is that FWIU we haven't identified and isolated all the various bacterial lines in the human gut. So doing this we would likely miss many populations which should be included in the mix. Other than routinely testing donor samples for every known antibiotic-resistant strains, it may be a while before we can make an ideal mix containing everything a healthy gut should include.
I'm guessing we agree on unappetizing civet coffee
""which the FDA has strained to regulate."" Generally speaking, if you are well regulated there is no straining involved.
Bravo! Best science writing on the subject!
Count me in with the ""punning about people dying through no fault of their own is in poor taste"" group.
I haven't read up much on this topic, but I imagine that some lab somewhere must be working on standardizing/customizing the microbiota composition and a better delivery medium (as opposed to plain poop). So far both the production and delivery methods seem quite crude for modern biotech.
I don't know. Freeze-dried nuggets sound pretty good.
I can't believe the donors' samples were not screened prior to the transplant. This seems like malpractice. -d
Given the topic, I wouldn't want to taste it either.
In light of this story I think a novel centering about this oft-mispronounced planet would be apt:
Good to see the FDA clenching down on this.

As has Canada; the Canuck Positioning System. Tells you where you are relative to the nearest Tim Hortons (falling back to Starbucks in some regions) and due to the density of the franchise net is accurate to within ten nanometers.
Slightly off topic... but, what happened to the rocket report this week? Definitely look forward to reading it every week.
If CPS goes out, it has an offline backup - ""roll up the rim"" to determine your latitude and longitude.
Relying on GPS navigation alone is probably bad for your brain. https://www.scientificamerican.com/arti ... of-london/ “If you think about the brain as a muscle, then certain activities, like learning maps of London’s streets, are like bodybuilding,” he says, “and all we can really say from our new findings is that you’re not working out these particular bits of the brain when you’re relying on SatNav.”
GPS is used for more than just driving. Phones use it to find towers. Retailers and shipping companies use it for logistics.
GPS is also used for time synchronization.
Yes, but my old map does not have real time traffic conditions on it. The point of the story is not that the world would end, just that things would drop in efficiency.
Damned socialism, always sneaking in those gigantic economic benefits when you least expect it.
Does Canada actually need GPS though? I mean there's only one road in Canada, right? You just need to know if you have to go left or right.
People also did just fine before written language was invented. So please stop writing stuff.
Some of the new stuff they're adding to the next gen GPS is pretty interesting. Like the Chips Message Robust Authentication for anti spoofing purposes. Perhaps do an article on some of those new technologies?
As a Canadian... you're not wrong.
Yeah, it's very nice of the US military to let civilians use their satellite system...
Yeah, it's kind of ironic that people jump straight to position/mapping, when in reality the GPS system is basically an array of very accurate clocks with known positions constantly transmitting the time.
Damn military spending with all those innovations spreading to civilian use.
Yes, but I can't ask a paper map ""OK Google, where did I park?""
Cripes. Reading a map while driving was a GIGANTIC pain in the rear and probably more than a bit dangerous as you try to read the street signs. Unless you were in Boston during the Big Dig, in which case there were no street signs and the streets moved on a regular basis.
GPS is certainly a boon. But aren't some of those alternative systems already in operation? And don't at least some devices support multiple constellations already? It probably won't help if we're right in the boresight of a huge CME, but redundancy is a good thing. I understand that they've recently been reviving LORAN as a backup coastal navigation system, despite it having been supplanted by GPS. Hell, the Navy revived instructional courses on sextant navigation just a few years ago; better safe than sorry. I wouldn't want to try using a sextant on the DC Beltway, though.
No, but you could mark your parking location on the paper map.
It’s a common horror story at conferences now “as I was getting back from the bar my phone went out.”
Indeed. UPS just added a cool gadget to their website recently: you can not only find what day your package will arrive, you can also track it in real time displayed on Google Maps, including which numbered stop it's at and what number your stop is.
In Iqaluit, population under 8000 at the time, there were three timmies.
I was on vacation and project over the last seven days, so I skipped it. We'll be back next week. Nice to know it was missed!
People keep trying to revive LORAN but it never really goes anywhere.
Welcome back Eric! You have been missed.
""Phones use it to find towers."" No they do not. https://pongcase.com/blog/cell-phones-work/
I never bothered to learn street names.
I can use a map just fine, but where I live there's so much new development that maps are outdated before they hit the printing press.
I was actually thinking as soon as I started reading (which was then covered in the article) about how much of that was down to using GPS as a source of timing rather than position. I don't know enough about the specifics of 4G LTE to comment but couldn't they (or do they?) have a lower rate fallback based on something else such as Precision time Protocol? I know it won't keep them going at full-speed but degradation to a lower throughput seems preferable to failure.
""If you think about the brain as a muscle"" I didnt read it as calling the brain a muscle. Maybe OP should have phrased it: ""If you think about the brain like a muscle."" It was analogy. End result, use it or lose it.
OTOH, you have to wonder if the sextant navigation has more to do with teaching history than being practical. Like where a college course in prehistoric life might teach stone knapping.
The brain needs stimulus to stay sharp. Just LIKE a muscle. He didn't say it IS a muscle. It's clear yours needs a workout.
If I remember right, the Navy's justification was to use it as a backup in case electronic navigation systems failed.
FIFY. Seriously, there’s a reason there’s no competition for Excel for power spreadsheeting. Word, otoh...
i got a chunk of this. but its still impressive
--------------------------------------------------------------- This is the article (° -°) my head all the way down here
Yeah, I had a hard time when the author started talking about annealing, and my brain went straight to this.
James Bond in ""Quantum of Shoelace"" liked his martinis annealed ... not stirred.
My Brain Hurts. Again. I made the mistake of searching on 'Ising Lattice problems' and looking at the Math. Last edited by nosmadar2016 on Thu Jun 13, 2019 12:42 pm
That's not a bad place for it to go, because simulated annealing is inspired by annealing in metallurgy. The idea is that the values in your potential solutions are like crystal grains in a metal, and they start out 'hot' moving around randomly a lot, so that you explore the solution landscape quickly and widely to not get stuck in any local minimums. Then over time you ""cool"" the simulation, as in vary the values by less and less so they find the very bottom of whatever hopefully global minimum trough they landed in while hot.
But these are only prototypes. They seem to be very susceptible to vibration issues. Not sure how one would get this working for commercial use.
Would it be possible to use a small setup like this to limit the problem domain without solving for a single output? Because if it can, then you could chain a number of these calculations together and use classical computing to configure the problem space and read out the results. I've always thought that some hybrid approach would be more likely to solve both the time and resource issues electron and photon computing run up against.
""every problem can be reduced to an Ising model"" [citation needed] For those interested in learning more about simulated annealing as an optimization method, the lovely book ""Algorithms to Live By"" has a nice overview in the chapter on radomness in algorithms.
Does this annealing compute the same problem set as D-Wave annealing? Any advantages?
Would this solution break down near large gravitational bodies like stars or black holes?
Optics is not exactly my strong suit when it comes to science - assuming a sufficiently large light modulator could be made (how big can they get?), couldn't an array of small sensors be used to detect the light from all the different SLM pixels? I'm thinking like...grab a bunch of SLR (or even cell phone) sensors at this point.... a 10x10 array would give you 100M x 100M pixels easily. Of course, I doubt it's that easy, but conceptually, wouldn't this a viable solution?
Vibration affects everything with optics and holography. It isn't trivial, but vibration isolation is a known problem space.
maybe space based machine?
Would the ~1400 iterations needed really hold when scaling up from 40kb to 10Mb? Time per iteration stays the same, but you are searching a much bigger forest -- wouldn't that take more iterations to find the solution?
Word is pretty powerful, but it's like a Bugatti Veyron on three wheels like a Reliant Robin. Using the powerful engine rarely results in good things unless you're super duper careful.
We can achieve vibration isolation so good that we can detect gravitational waves. The issue is not whether it is possible to achieve the required vibration isolation. It's merely whether this system can be implemented in a cost effective manner.
A startup, Optalysys, claims to have solved that problem and is trying to commercialize a similiar design. They target pattern recognition.
So it's like asking a Magic 8-Ball, except the answers are various lumens instead of ""Reply Hazy, Try Again Later""? 0_o
One thing I wish was in the article is context. You mention   Is this good? How does it compare to traditional computers of a comparable cost? How do Ising models relate to typical (or even niche) computational tasks? In other words, is this a neat toy or a legitimate breakthrough?
I think I had a stroke. This is like the 4th Chris article this year where I feel like I understand it. Or maybe you just need time and brain osmosis to slowly start to make sense of all this quantum mechanics. Or maybe it is more that I understand the concept and do not notice my eyes staring blankly during the actual quantum spookiness.
One thing I seem to notice with a lot of computing terms is they generally are well named, using logical and helpful physical analogies to the abstract numerical concepts they represent. I appreciate that
Well if you truly can scale it but the computation times remain similar then eventually yes. It did sound like there was a gotcha with the setup requirements though. Sometimes I wonder if some of this stuff wont be practical till we are in the cold of space yet somehow avoiding cosmic rays as well.

""Modern processors, as good as they are, simply don’t cope well with some problems"" We don't have to stick to typical ""modern processors"". GPUs have been used to speed up annealing with good results, and building fast processors optimized for annealing is always an option. I'm not convinced a light-based approach can beat electronics in any reasonable time frame. Also the class of problems we can apply this to may remain small. I worked on algorithms similar to annealing (optimizing FIR filter taps in class-IV signal channels) and it was a huge pain. Everything is completely non-deterministic and getting lost around poor solutions can be a major problem. Arriving at a cost function can be difficult, and may involve guesswork and heuristics.

*Insert BBT laugh track*
The difference from what I understand is that the Optical approach has something approaching a linear growth rate compared to the size and complexity of the problem, while the electronic equivalent is closer to an exponential curve. It's like comparing a bubble sort to a binary sort.

""Other problems may take longer to reach a solution, but probably not much, since every problem can be reduced to an Ising model."" This statement contradicts Kurt Godel's proof that for any formal logic system, you can always ask a question using that system that the system cannot answer. This proof is also at the heart of the P vs. NP issue in algorithms.
Well the missing part here would be: is an ising model a Von Neumann Turing Machine? If the answer is yes then the statement is correct. The answer is yes: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1084.pdf, you can encode a turing machine in a lattice. You are quibbling about computability and or the halting problem etc. That is orthogonal. Still congratulations on achieving 1st year? 2nd year? Or being too old to remember it all correctly. Or sleeping through class?
Just the ising on the cake....
I've read a bunch of these articles about quantum computers and I'm hoping someone here can clarify something for me. Are all annealing processes the same? [poorly phrased] That is, can any class of problems solvable through annealing process A be solved using annealing processes B, C, ...? [gooder phrased] I'm assuming 'yes' because they all seem to be about finding the lowest energy state from destructive interference.
How does this approach avoid local minima (solutions that are better than any other nearby solution, but are not globally the best)? Or does it avoid them?
I don't know the precise details of the algorithm here, but: - like all random heuristics, annealing cannot guarantee the global optimum solution - annealing tries to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum by starting off by varying the solutions by a lot, so the odds of jumping out of one valley in the landscape into another, potentially better valley is high. Over time the magnitude of randomization is reduced and so it tends to find the bottom of the valley instead of jumping out.
I respectfully disagree with both of you. You can create fantastic things in both - but with great power comes great responsibility...
Ditto. I have been using Word since the mid 80s. Virtually none of my Word documents are translatable to any other modern Word processor because they are all missing features that I use routinely in Word. I think the basic problem that most have is that the primary shift in thought required to get the magic out of it is just beyond them. I don't create documents in a linear fashion. It is more of a process of continual transformation of the whole using VB macros, database merge capabilities, etc. This approach allows throughput that I can't come close to achieving with other tools. In other words, I use Word in my documentation efforts in similar fashion to how I use an advanced editor in my programming. I know of nothing else that even occupies the same plane of functionality.
Can that possibly be true? I’m skeptical but maybe I’m missing some subtlety with the definition of flip versus stay the same.
That is easier siad than done, especially on equipment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. it is also why John Deere is fading away. it won't be quick but in 20 years I expect John Deere to be a shell of it's former self. people aren't buying new john deere and going to new brands to fill the gap.
""But in the 1980s and 1990s and well into the first decade of the 20th century..."" I'm guessing that's the 21st century. Unless, god forbid, steampunk is actually a real thing?
This is good, and it should go even further, such as reducing or eliminating tax on spare parts and repair labor. The amount of waste generated by devices which either can't be repaired or at a cost greater than a new one is absurd and we need to tip the scale the other way. When companies will not hold themselves accountable, we need legislation.
Everybody does it, using a particular example that a lot of people are familiar with is totally misguided and not thought through. I suppose if the author had really thought it through they would have used an example no one had heard of to better illustrate their case...
This is exactly what we need. The manufacturing industry has created an industry of throw away equipment by introducing these license agreements. All to their benefit. All to keep you buying the ""latest and greatest"" every other year. ""Oh I'm sorry, but that phone is out of warranty and will cost you $300 dollars to repair through our authorized repair network. It would probably just be cheaper to buy this brand spanking new phone."" All when the older device is perfectly fine and could be repaired at a fraction of that price through a 3rd party repair shop. I have a friend who does just that. He repairs people devices that have since had their warranty's expire and would otherwise cost 3-4 times to repair through their authorized repair network than what he charges them. Of course he's not ""authorized"" to make these repairs, so I'm sure if they found out the companies would probably sue him. Last edited by Rabbiddog on Thu Jun 20, 2019 7:12 am
So, how about giving trained professionals the choice to repair devices with third-party components for a fraction of the cost compared to official shops? This is something Apple has been (wrongfully, IMHO) fighting against fervently.
Instead of a right to repair law, just write laws that require companies to support equipment for five years on their own dime - and to provide loaner hardware if the downtime is going to be longer than a set period. This has already happened in the aircraft engines business. Once upon a time GE could sell an engine at cost or even a loss knowing that over the life of the engine the replacement parts were going to be a guaranteed revenue stream. Now, GE sells a service contract to the airline along with the engine. Obviously, commercial aviation is a highly-regulated industry so not just anyone is allowed to work on the engines, but anyone trained by GE at any FBO can fix the engines - and get paid by GE to do so.
This is a hazard in a lot of industries (e.g. back when tire inflators in a can were made with flammable liquid/gas this was a real hazard to tire shops when a customer didn't bother to tell them they used one of those products to inflate the tire). But, on the other hand, lots of people are capable of following directions and not screwing up something like a battery replacement. I did it on an old iPod Video and it saved me a crap ton of money when the alternatives would have been paying way too much for Apple replace the battery or buying a new one from Apple. With companies like John Deere, a lot of what they keep proprietary is their software. So, a farmer can't just hook up a scan tool to their malfunctioning tractor to find out what's broken. In the automotive industry, the government mandated the OBD standard so that this is relatively easy to do. A $15 dongle for the car and a Smart Phone running a free app can read codes these days. I've saved a ton of money over the years diagnosing and fixing car problems myself. It's really not that hard to do. Last edited by Jeff2Space on Thu Jun 20, 2019 7:25 am
Aside from battery replacements on iphones how much market is there really for retail priced tech repairs anymore, anyway? I can recall 20-30 years ago the technology repair market was a reasonable business to be in. Someone could charge a reasonable rate to fix a VCR, or a CD player, or a television, or a computer and they would have enough clientele to make a living at it. It seemed like there were computer service shops on every other block 15-20 years ago. Now aside from a few small phone repair hole in the wall type places or geek squad I can't remember seeing much of it. There will likely always be a market for tractor repairs because they'll always be expensive enough new that repairing them makes sense to almost anyone, but I think thanks to cheap Chinese built tech there just isn't a market for repairing much of anything tech device related anymore.
Typo? The caption under the (frustrated Dr.) Farms are the only area where users are frustrated about repair access... I think you meant: Farms are not the only area where users are frustrated about repair access...
I think a balance is required here, and it is a difficult one to find. This is especially true of modern networked electronic devices. Take for instance the CANBus controllers on farm equipment. Currently, most CANbus implementations(for example J1939) are totally open and unencrypted. This allows a user to read signals off the bus, and to inject new information onto the bus which will be read by other controllers. This is great for repairability but has some serious downsides when it comes to security or reliability. A poorly implemented CANbus reader can negatively impact the entire system. Most manufacturers are moving to an encrypted CANbus implementation which will lock out all third-party devices. Emissions software running on engine controllers is another area of balance. If we allow end-users to modify this software the first thing they are going to do is defeat the emissions controls. Is this desirable? The right to repair is important, but how the laws are implemented is critical. We do not want a law dictating design because that will stifle progress.
Found this typo.
Thanks for the FUD.
When a consumer can't do something ""simple"" like easily replace the dead battery in their $1000+ smartphone without paying the manufacturer a good fraction of the cost of the phone, that's a problem, IMHO.
Your concern for the safety of people is commendable, although I don't think it's necessarily warranted - bad components can exist whether third-party or not (remember the exploding Galaxy Notes?). However, we're not necessarily talking about a few dollars. We can be talking about $1200 vs. a few minutes of tinkering.
I agree. I'm saying is there enough money in repairing tech that anyone other than Geek Squad can make it work? I always would want to be able to repair my own gear, but I'm not likely to take any of my tech gear somewhere and pay to have it fixed. I think most other people are also unwilling to pay a reasonable price to have their stuff fixed, either, but they're more likely to just not fix stuff and replace it.
""While Grimes doesn’t disagree with Weems on the need for quality management, he also sees this as an industry attempt to change the focus of the debate. “Although a growing number of third-party servicers have received certification for compliance with quality management systems, manufacturers still refuse to share service materials.” Personally, I'm really leery of possibly opening up medical equipment repairs to every tom, dick, and harry; especially with the current ""slash and burn all regulations"" administration. However, if there's already a certification system in place, there's no reason service materials shouldn't be sold to 3rd party repair shops.
A prefect example, from earlier in the year. I have a friend (yet another) who's had an older iPhone that works perfectly fine (yes, I get it, not trying pile on Apple, this just happens to be the manufacturer, they all do it.). He's had it for like 6 years or so. He has no desire to upgrade to a new device. The phone works great, does what it needs to do for him, why spend $800+ on a new device when there is no need. Then he cracked the screen, it still worked, but he wanted the screen fixed. Took it to a Genius Bar, it was out of warranty so they wanted to charge him something like $350 to replace the screen. At which pint the ""Genius"" went into his sales pitch to sell him the ""latest an greatest"". My friend said he'd think about and left. After mildly ranting about his situation on FB, I texted him, told him a know someone that might be able to help. I contacted my other friend a we all met at a pub for a couple beers. My one friend showed the other his phone and he was like ""Yup, no problem"". He even had spare displays on hand. Two days later, my friend had his phone back in prefect working order, and instead of approximately $350, the other guy only charged him $150. And my other friend, he actually repairs laptops and phones on a regular basis and has done literally hundreds of repairs over the years. I always pass his name around and yes, there is a demand for his services even now. Last edited by Rabbiddog on Thu Jun 20, 2019 7:42 am

Where I live there are still a few shops that do things like repair laptops and smartphones. One of the places is called ""uBreakiFix"" or something like that. And that's another part of ""right to repair"". For people that don't want to fix their own device, an independent shop can often do the work for a fraction of the cost of what the manufacturer would charge. Independent repair shops create competition which helps to drive down costs to the consumer.
There's a bad caption on one of the images:   I'm guessing that's meant to be ""aren't"".
People die in car crashes due to faulty repairs. Of course, the benefits of allowing third-party repairs of cars has outweighed the risks. Of course, if you want to get paid to work on a car you have to have some sort of certification (ASE, e.g.) and insurance. I would be perfectly content to have a similar certification process for consumer electronics or medical devices (especially medical devices as they're under FDA regulation). Yes, there will always be anecdotal cases where things go wrong. But we accept those sorts of risks all the time as a society when the gains are worth the cost (I'm looking at you automobiles).

Of course, if I wanted the screen on an HTC phone from a few years ago replaced by one of these shadetree guys would they do it? Probably not. Hey, more power to ya! To each his own. Still doesn't negate my point that yes, given a choice between paying exorbitant prices for ""authorized"" repairs, or a reasonable price form some ""shadetree repair guys"" most people will go with the ""shadtree repair guys"". Of course the whole point of this article and discussion is there would be far less ""shadetree repair guys"" if it weren't for these end user agreements.

Well while I don’t agree with your arguments against RTR, I did wanna say sorry you got sick buddy. That sounds like a really bad experience.
I'd say the $1000+ smartphone is a bigger problem - we're long past the point where smartphones were revolutionary. Another problem is that the battery died fast in a $1000 smartphone and it isn't covered by the manufacturer.
I think one of the toughest issues is that the right to repair is toothless without the mandate to design for repairability. Sure, I can replace an iPhone battery today because the way it’s designed allows the screen to be taken off with a spudger. But it’s already at the point where it’s designed such that you lose a major feature when doing it without very specialized (and likely very expensive) tools - water resistance. Obviously it’s possible to design for both water resistance AND the ability to easily replace the seals. But what you can’t do is design for water resistance, ability to easily replace the seals AND the look that Apple wants. Fast forward a few years and Apple decides to sonicly weld the glass to the body for “greater strength” or whatever reason they chose to market. And I don’t mean to be cynical - maybe it is a legitimate design decision that makes it a better product. But it also makes it utterly hopeless to repair without highly specialized, horrendously expensive equipment. In other words, the easiest way for companies to get around right to repair laws is to design their products such that the tools necessary to effect the repair are so expensive that only extremely high volume repair houses can afford them.
I'm not sure what you mean by more power to ya, my point was just that I don't know that there's a market space for legitimate business in tech repair. The existence of shadetree repairmen doesn't really refute that, useful though they may be on occasion.
Good luck fixing your Tesla.
Indeed - even things I used to take for granted I've found are much harder these days. I had a laptop that was a year old, out of warrenty, and the battery bulged. I popped the bottom lid off and unplugged the battery...then came the headache I couldn't find one anywhere except direct from Dell and they didn't seem to sell it anywhere I could find except calling and begging them to please let me buy only the battery at my risk to install...a few transfers later I finally got someone who was willing to sell me the parts even though I wasn't an ""authorized repair center"" but it was the most pain I've had in a long time getting parts for something. Total cost, $70 including shipping Total time, 2 weeks to get the parts + 5 minutes to do the swap and test it all out Even though its a half dozen screws and the battery ""just unplugs"" easy as doing the RAM, SSD, or any other module its still not considered a user replaceable part.
How do you mandate that something can be fixed? Does that mean the screen as a whole has to be fixable or do you have to be able to separate out the digitizer? How about the amplifier embedded in the connection between the digitizer and the ribbon cable? The only way to motivate companies to design for repair is to put them on the hook in some fashion for repairs. Though I'm not sure it's fair to make Apple or Samsung pay for repairs for every dropped phone, perhaps requiring phones be sold with 3 free screen replacements (if- and as needed) and one free battery replacement would be a solid start.
Having worked as an Apple Authorized technician repairing iPhones with water resistance, I can tell you first hand there's no specialized equipment. To reapply the water resistant ""seal"", it's a very thinly cut adhesive. that's cut to the specific iPhone. I gotta say, iPhones are really easy to work on when you have the right parts. everything from a display repair to a battery replacement, it's easy... but it's just that you need the parts. Edit: Applying the seal is a breeze with Apple's part. The adhesive comes in a neat packaging that allows you to align the seal before taking off the rest of the plastic. However, without that plastic guide, it would be near impossible, because of how thin the seal actually is Last edited by Xyler on Thu Jun 20, 2019 8:08 am
What makes it tough is that the mandate to design to repairability will necessarily lead to compromises in functionality, at least in some devices. So, as a blanket demand, it's a lot to ask. So maybe it would be a better idea to demand e.g. that a battery must retain at least 50% of the capacity for 5 years. How the manufacturer accomplishes this is on them.
This is playing out in full display in my state over John Deere and I think Vice or some other media outlet covered it as there is a pending lawsuit issued by the state. Someone mentioned that John Deere was a shell of its former self...I honestly can't recognize them. You used to venture out to the Western part of the state and people who likely were part of the farming community were always wearing John Deere swag has dropped. I am not a farmer by any means, but some one in my area always either has a family member or knows someone that is. It is hard to plunk out $250K - $500K for a machine only to be told well you own it, but you can't do any maintenance on it similar to an Apple mentality where everything is locked out from you doing so. The sad thing is farmers has resulted to literally hacking their machines to run code supposedly from Europe which has unlocked the features needed to service their machines. The issue at hand is a John Deere rep has to come out when your machine broken, throwing codes which can be up to 3 weeks as reported by some. A farmer cannot wait that long compared to someone with a smartphone. Crops have sensitive windows especially when weather is involved, and now the economy. The prices of the visits are not exactly cheap from what is supposedly reported. It is almost what I am hearing second hand that it has turned into an Apple Genius bar situation for tractors that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars which farmers cannot sit around and wait.

Kotor wasn't EA. That was Bioware, iirc. The reason we don't have a Kotor 3 is probably ea. Likewise Mass Effect, another Bioware franchise, also ruined by EA. The only good thing EA can do now is to roll over and die.
reason we dont have Kotor 3 is because they realized they could make the same game but without the licensing costs of Star Wars. that game was ME.
I was excited by the reveal trailer but the gameplay demo was pretty underwhelming. Respawn is a good studio, so it's heartening to hear the gameplay is more fun than it looked. Hopefully the Metroidvania talk pans out and this game is good after all.
Of course when we finally get a SW single player game, it's more The Force Unleashed (mediocre, but with a proven sales record) than 1313. EA is is going to EA.
Didn't know that, but even if so, Bioware did a great job, EA touched it and now it's ruined.
Frustrating thing is JK2 and Jedi Outcast pretty much perfected lightsaber/force power gameplay over fifteen years ago... Yet here we still are. Just remake those titles in Unreal 4 and you're done!
Between EA and Disney, I've pretty much had enough of Star Wars for at least another decade or two
That and SWTOR. They decided to make KotOR 3 an MMO and butcher (probably out of spite) all of the interesting additions Obsidian added to the series.
As you may recall they actually said SWTOR would have so much content that it'd effectively be ""KOTOR 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9"".
And that was Past-Bioware. Golden Age Bioware. They don't have many/any OG guys left. After Anthem, you don't want them touching shit.
But could this be the Titanfall 3 I'm looking for?
I don't trust them not to put ""surprise mechanics"" in it, and even if they don't I won't buy cause it's EA and they're permanently on my sh*t list. Also, I don't really care about Star Wars anymore. Or maybe they won't include loot boxes (or whatever they want to call them now that the term is tainted) and just go full on surveillance capitalism by making the game always online so they can data mine your PC while you play.

Speak for yourself. As a former BioWare fan, and after Anthem, I want them touching shit. I want them to bury their heads in it as a punishment.
Well, I wont buy anything from this publisher anymore, so I guess Gamestop (or BestBuy - anyone really) who sells used-games will get my money if this game turns out to be worth the trip to the store.
It's not anything special though... It isn't the open world rpg we all wanted with dismemberment, it's a unleashed clone on rails by the look of it. Another half assed EA product in my mind. With the money they toss around ""solid"" isn't nearly good enough for the ONLY single player star wars game theyve made in years.
JK2 and Academy you mean. And yes. Most important to me is how it compares to those two. A good light saber game and heaps of good raytrscing and I will borrow money to upgrade my computer in order to play it.
I'm cautiously optimistic about this game, and the previews have pushed it up a notched. Not enough to pre-order though. I'll try to find a trial for EA Access around November so I can try it out during the 10 hour Access preview period right before the release.

I'm just very surprised that EA let one of their dev studios put together a game that isn't using that awful in-house graphics engine that ham strung the development and playability of other big name franchises like Dragon Age.
It would be nice if this game actually came out good and does not commit the sins that EA is known for like loot boxes. If it comes out good without EA's typical sins and becomes a blockbuster, this might start EA on the path for reform. If EA commits its usual sins ad causes this game to fail, I hope that Namco will get a Star Wars license. Project Aces could turn out another Rogue Squadron game if that happens.
It really is Disney's fault. Of course they were going to make an exclusive deal with another mega-corporation. Of course the pair would only want to make iterative content that doesn't deviate from the proven formula and challenge fan expectations. Given the angry reactions we've seen to just about everything (movies and games), who can blame them? Still, I'm bored with all of it. Last edited by monogon on Sat Jun 22, 2019 12:54 pm
Don't go to GameStop. They are as much to blame for the current state of gaming as EA does as a horrible company and prime enabler of the Day 1 DLC, microtransactions, pre-order bonus, and other nonsense we see plaguing the industry. Last edited by ryanja on Sat Jun 22, 2019 1:38 pm
No one should have exclusive rights. It doesn't promote a desires to make anything other than what they are known for and that's how we ended up with two half assed loot box MP only star wars games years apart. Before we got games that were licensed and it felt like we were drowning in a sea of star wars, many good, on a yearly basis. Imagine paradox casually releasing a star wars dlc, imagine red making that rpg we all have demanded for ages and not gotten. Better yet we can get JA2 finally and Disney can f right off with the no dismembering.
This. I'm just hopeful EA doesn't make Respawn slap an obnoxious progress-halting mission at the 8-hour mark, like we conveniently saw in Anthem.
This was started before Respawn was acquired by EA. Hell, it looks like development was actually started before Titanfall 2 was released. So them being able to use whatever tech they wanted was probably a core part of the deal. Otherwise Respawn would probably have just continued to develop their own IP, something that EA wasn't guaranteed to be able to sell.
The troubles with Anthem might have contributed to this. If EA saw how poorly that was progressing, they might have just said ""fuck it, show us what you got,"" with this one.
As much as I hate EA I have to admit this is one of those ""shut up and take my money"" moments
Three years ago I made a promise to myself never to purchase another EA game and I haven't looked back! One can only take so much. I wish EA would disappear.
At this point, the instant I see ""EA"", my interest drops below zero. I assume they're going to mess up any game they ship. It takes very strong word-of-mouth to overcome that label. And then they've siloed themselves off into a different store than the one I want to use. There are two titles with a decent reputation that I'd at least *look* at, Titanfall 1 and 2, but they insist on stuffing a launcher and their own advertising/DRM engine down my throat. I deal with two web stores, Valve's and GOG's, and the only reason I use GOG is because they don't require a launcher. (I buy from them preferentially, when it's an option, because of this.) If EA wants to put things in one of those two stores, I become a potential customer at least, although not a likely one. But the way they've decided to do business, they make almost no games I want, and then can't reach me even if I did. I think there's a pretty good chance that ME3 was the last EA game I'll ever buy. (I did a dedicated OS install to run their launcher long enough to play that game, and wiped the drive when I was done.) Last edited by malor on Sat Jun 22, 2019 1:33 pm
You know you can just say ""Steam"" right?
Yes, but the sentence construction would have been awkward. ""Steam"" is a not a posssessive, where ""GOG's store"" is. I suppose I could have said ""Steam and GOG"", but that wasn't how it come out when I typed it.

I hate on EA a LOT. Like, probably more than what is healthy. But, the one place I will give them props on is their $15/month all-you-can-eat buffet games library through their subscription service. I don't have it because, frankly, I avoid anything they touch, but the library is quite large, has games from indie devs, and has strong appeal to people who do like their games. Plus, you can download (cache) them and not just stream. The publisher and their games don't interest me, but nonetheless, I can still see that it is a value regardless of my opinion of them.
Electronic Arts, in their never ending quest for monetization, will screw it up given time. I don't really like being this jaded but it's the only option I see.
You lost me at Electronic Arts.... They will have to show that their market strategy as changed before i buy anything from them again. And to think i loved their games back in the Megadrive era....
I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, if this game is legitimately good and lacks EA's now-typical exploitative, anti-consumer gambling mechanics, one might hope for its success to show EA that this is the right direction to go. On the other hand, it is foolish to think EA wouldn't use the positive PR as an opportunity to further obfuscate the fact that its greed-driven, shareholder- worshiping, fuck-the-customer attitude probably has been the most destructive force in mainstream video gaming over the past several years. It's sort of like if you saw Emperor Palpatine saving a puppy. Sure, you could shake his hand for doing a good deed for once. Maybe he'd rethink his choices in life. But this is still Emperor Palpatine we're talking about here. He's probably going to take that puppy home and cook it for dinner.
We made the wheels fall off a Tesla remotely! After loosening the bolts earlier
The scenario at the end of the article would make for a cool action movie scene, but I think you might be underplaying it a bit. It’s not too difficult to know where a UPS double trailer is headed if you live near one of the disto hubs. Of course larger companies like UPS, FedEx, or Amazon will probably be keeping tight watch over any deviations from the “routine” course for these vehicles. Eh, perhaps I read too much sci-fi.
Since Tesla obviously doesn't use GPS to determine lane informqtion, is the Regulus press release outright lying? Or, did they trick the Tesla into taking a different turn that was 500ft early, and then carefully word things so that it sounded like the Tesla was going on an off road adventure when really it was just taking the wrong turn?
I hope they put this in the next Italian Job reboot.
As far as the hostile takeover scenario goes, by the time vehicles are driving totally without drivers I'd expect dead reckoning to also play a role. Over the course of a few hours it's not going to drift that much.
Meh. Nowhere near as bad as the Chrysler hacking that found they could activate the windshield wipers or even enable or disable the brakes from miles away via a cell signal built into the car.
Great analysis, Jim. This is what I come to Ars for.
There are a bunch of security issues surrounding autonomous vehicles. gps spoofing- while technically fairly easy- is very far from the scary, dangerous remote takeover attacks demonstrated a couple of years ago. I’d rather vendors focused on protecting the CAN.
Forget Teslas, this hack would mislead many (if not most in the special case of those driving through unfamiliar places) people today. I have been in the vehicle with drivers who turned at the wrong time when google said something like ""take the next right"" and ended up in a parking lot instead of on a street. It is as much of a don't care when a Tesla does it as it is when a person does it.
This one?
Knowing nothing beyond this article, shouldn't it be possible to ignore a signal if it is too strong and, especially on large vehicles, use multiple antennae to judge signal direction?
Dead reckoning is not inertial navigation. Dead reckoning is taking your crouse and speed and plotting your position based on the distance traveled in time. Inertial navigation is using accelerometers and gyroscopes to calculate position. INS is capable of being more accurate than GPS if you are willing to spend the budget on the gyros.
There are other, more insidious attacks that can be carried out. One of which is highlighted by another Israeli company, in which bad actors follow a vehicle they want to rob, use a GPS spoofer to misdirect it onto side roads where they proceed to rob it. Less violent means of theft would be to misdirect a delivery truck so that in delivers cargo to the wrong warehouse. That would depend on the delivery driver not making note of the fact that he's say on the wrong street but right address, or right street but wrong warehouse. Then there's also possibilities for kidnapping and other crimes. All of them rely on the driver not understanding that they're being misdirected until it's too late, which brings me to the subject of self-driving cars. Since self-driving cars are totally relying on GPS (or Galileo or such) for navigation, they don't have the fallback that human drivers have. Human drivers are much more likely to be paying attention to where they are going and why, even if they are using a GPS for navigation, and they are much less predictable than algorithms, so they are probably harder to trick. edit: I misremembered the details of the video.

Mob high-jacking of trailer trucks often involved inside cooperation/intimidation (""Nice family/house/business ya got there. Be a shame if something happened to it."" And any 'tight watch' is just as unlikely as cities/companies using steps to prevent the well-publicized ransomware attacks. Overhead is avoided like the plague especially if there is insurance. If it can be pulled off, crooks will do it.
You take a SIN unit and a GPS unit and run the results through a Kalman filter, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter and you get a fix that will discount any GPS spoofing.
But isn't with spoofed GPS, it will think it is is the correct route? And the report to HQ also on the correct route
GPS works via triangulation using extremely precise knowledge of signal travel time and the location of the satellites at the time they sent the signal. It is not directional. The simple solution here and the one that I think will come into play long term is to navigate visually and using the odometer in the same way that people do. I'd be surprised if they aren't already doing some of that for things like construction zones. There is no reason for a Tesla to be dependent on GPS though you would keep that around as a secondary source. Of course, as soon as they start working that way, someone will ""hack"" them by changing street signs or road markings. It would not grow past that possibility by trusting maps more than signs because maps are never perfectly up to date. The ""reality"" as seen on-site at the moment must be trusted. IMO, if the hack would work on a human driver who is unfamiliar with the area, there is no reason to be concerned about it working on a Tesla.
Nicely-done article. Just the right level of detail for me on the weekend. To produce this focused polished piece, Jim Salter must have had a hard time suppressing his usual impulse to jump into multiple pages of details.
Kalman filters are not magic; they can be mislead. When you say SIN unit, do you mean an IMU? If so, yeah, that works reasonably well, and can limit your position error. Being able to reject a spoof after a GPS knock-off attack requires a pretty good clock oscillator (better than is in a normal GPS unit) and some sophisticated software. It's not like these are going to be deployed at thousands of dollars cost (currently) on most cars or delivery trucks. Maybe a cheap 3 axis accelerometer and some dead reckoning software but at some point the SW is probably going to have to decide whether it's GPS or its bargain basement IMU is closer to the truth.
If it blindly trusts its GPS data, as automotive applications do now, yes. Open question whether manufacturers will be proactive and smart and build anti spoofing mechanisms into GNSS on fully autonomous freight vehicles before the first wave of hijackings, or reactive and wait until after hundreds or thousands of incidents... But anybody who's paid much attention to history probably knows where to put their money.
It was a struggle.
The driver who does the exact same route everyday to the distribution center is probably not even using the gps to get there, since, you know they do the route every day of the week.
Spoofing attacks help highlight the importance of keeping basic safety and driving-related functions in the car versus all this 5G autonomous driving nonsense the wireless carriers are promoting. Edit: mentally scratch promoting and insert hyping. Last edited by ktmglen on Sat Jun 22, 2019 10:53 am
No I mean a strap down strapdown inertial navigator, which has been called a SIN, to my knowledge, for the last 50 years. Kalam filters to error correct from multiple navigation inputs. So if someone is spoofing your GPS, Kalman filter will ignore the GPS data.
Do you really think the US DOD (who runs the GPS system) would not let US intelligence agencies have access to the keys needed to spoof GPS? That seems like a naive assumption. I'm sure both parties there would love to restrict the ability to spoof GPS to only themselves. It's also not clear at all that this is ""easily"" fixable. One, there's the practical aspect of rolling out all new hardware (probably including new satellites) to implement the new system. And two it's not clear it would help. GPS is a unidirectional protocol and is based entirely around comparing the timing of the various signals received. What stops an attacker from just recording the valid and signed signals and the replaying them with adjusted timing a fraction of a second later? Public key crypto in no way lets you distinguish between the original transmission and a copy of the transmission.

So if someone is spoofing your GPS, Kalman filter will ignore the GPS data. It depends. If it’s a tightly-coupled INS/GPS, it’s using the GPS pseudoranges and delta range measurements directly in the integrated Kalman filter, and will apply a reasonableness test based on the KF’s current state covariance estimates - usually about 4-sigma. But if the spoofer slowly walks the spoofed satellites away from the true measurements, then the KF can be fooled. What you need to combat this kind of spoofer is the combination of an INS/GPS and a beam forming antenna. As long as you can initialize the system in a trusted way, you know at all times where the satellites are with respect to the antenna, and can use multiple active elements in the antenna to generate a nonlinear antenna gain pattern with high gain “beams” pointing at the satellites, and very low gain elsewhere. Even if the spoofer can get its RF into the system, you can see that all the energy is coming from the same line of sight, and know you’re being spoofed.
A slow GPS attack is much more difficult to defend against but a SIN/GPS will stop a sudden spoof. For something like a self driving car, a sun sight/star sight would be easy to do. A third fix in the system should be enough.
I've worked on security research projects on both GPS and ADS-B for air traffic. Both systems have similar paths to vulnerability that Jim pointed out: recent developments that rendered infrastructure assumptions by the original system developers obsolete, the biggest of which is software defined radio. We looked into potential system risks and solutions and the problem with most cryptographic solutions is that the original systems just won't support massive hardware changes, as you point out. For ADS-B, which has a two-band system (in the US at least), the 1090MHz system is the same as secondary radar running off of 115 bit messages. Given the difficulty of deploying ADS-B since the 1990s, I don't see that system's hardware being replaced any time soon. We tried to come up with something that would at least inhibit some kind of attack shenanigans, but it always came back to relative risk. The vulnerabilities to really effective attacks rely on fantastical scenarios requiring a lot of equipment that's noticeable to investigators arriving in the area within several areas. Sometimes requiring bad weather conditions to work. More likely scenarios usually rely on area denial rather than spoofing. Sustaining that would probably require a state actor of some kind rather than a small independent bad actor. And in any case, to be effective at disrupting air traffic, you have to sustain an attack at a busy place which will get a huge amount of attention very quickly. So the risk is limited. Most of the systems people I talk to tend to converge on taking the threats seriously but being skeptical that these vulnerabilities could be exploited in Die Hard 2 fashion. The response methods I tend to like best are some kind of rapid detection by the system (cribbed from learning systems defenses proposed in ad hoc vehicle networks) using direction and ranging added onto existing ground systems (the ADS-B ground networks). One of the best researchers looking at this systematically that I've seen would be Martin Strohmeier's group (Switzerland and U of Oxford).
abruptly slowing down, activating the right turn signal, and making a sharp turn off the main road,"" according to Regulus. ""The driver immediately took manual control but couldn't stop the car from leaving the road Since Tesla obviously doesn't use GPS to determine lane informqtion, is the Regulus press release outright lying?

Quote: It's entirely possible—[b]even somewhat trivial, if you don't mind becoming an instant felon/[b]—to use GNSS spoofing to convince an autonomous or semi-autonomous car that it isn't where it thought it was, and it should turn on the wrong road. But here's the thing. While it's not necessarily possible to spoof an AV into crashing into something because the GPS went stupid, it does seem possible to use the spoofing to hijack something - like autonomous delivery vehicles, or to facilitate a kidnapping (depending on the level of autonomy the car has - some won't let the driver actually drive, after all, since it doesn't come equipped with driver controls). Sure, no crashing due to GPS, but I'd not hand-wave away the issue that spoofing GPS could play a major role in malfeasance that could potentially result in death - something that would be much more difficult to do if the driver had control. After all, people who are considering crimes of that type become felons anyhow in the commission of it. If it's ""trivially easy"" to pull off, then it's not beyond the means of criminals to use in some fashion to get hold of an AV and its contents for the time it takes for authorities to figure out where it went AND dispatch units to assist it. This is crime in the 21st century we're talking here. Criminals are going to use whatever leverage they have to do what they want to do. GPS spoofing isn't a big deal - yet. But it has the potential to become so, especially once AV's can no longer be driven by people at all.
i do hope rupert murdoch has not seen the bond flick ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" because it might inspire him to update his ten-year plan
From the 10 minutes or so I spent researching it when I wanted to see if I could put together a handheld device with some inertial positioning, it looked like if you weren't willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars and giving it a cubic foot of space or so then you'll probably be about 25km off of your actual position within 10 minutes. On a ship that's fine but it's not gonna fit into a car very well unless they really want to dedicate the space.
Cell phone chipsets are now also using GLONASS and Galileo, and I think they're planning to add Beidou as well. That's going to make the problem substantially more complex, and hacking attempts much more visible. The simplest attack would be 'jam everything but GPS, spoof GPS', but assuming that's even possible, the fact that three of the four guidance systems abruptly vanished, and the remaining one says you're now five miles from where you thought you were, is probably going to be fairly noticeable as a hack attempt. Even software can probably figure that one out. That also has the side effect of making that kind of an attack extremely ""noisy"", and much more noticeable. People who aren't the target are going to notice that something's wrong.
Would RAIM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_ ... monitoring have detected the false signal in this case? In aeronautical applications, RAIM detects errors in a satellite source and will either flag it as unreliable or, if enough satellites are in range, exclude the erroneous signal and determine the position solution with the remaining ones.

INS error bars will always increase, and requires ongoing correction, or those errors will eventually exceed those of GPS.
Very good (and timely) article. I’ve been struggling with how to build a secure timing distribution system (NTP). My initial thoughts were to have a radio clock signal at a geographically disparate location connected to a separate time server, but that only adds redundancy. If the GNSS is spoofed on the primary location there is no way for NTP to figure this out. And, as stated, a KF can be “walked” into error. Considering cyber security implications of manipulating timing this seems to be a serious issue. What’s the realistic “fix?”
Short answer: no. Slightly longer answer: RAIM works by computing solutions using all combinations of GPS measurements; if you are tracking five or more satellites, you can determine which one is bad. But in the spoofing case, if the spoofer can overthrow the legitimate signals, RAIM will see everything is consistent.
Yup. Chrysler had to do a recall to fix it.
Any details on how the drafting works here? Is it like Dominion-style where you have a pre-set tableau, or maybe more like Ascension/Shards of Infinity Style where there's an open market of N cards that you buy from? Or maybe something else entirely different. I enjoy battle card games like this but I also don't find that they really scratch the same itch as a CCG where you get the joy of collecting as well as playing.
Count me in that latter group - skip.
I remember a lot of CCG that fit in a box during the nineteens, I had one based on Batman 2.
You divide the cards into small piles representing characters, locations and schools of magic, then the players take turns choosing one of each and smash them together to build their decks.
I'm surprised there was no mention of Epic, White Wizard's original game that was supposed to be like a collectible card game experience in an even smaller box.
Has anybody played both Sorcerer and Harry Potter: Battle for Hogwarts? My wife loves Hogwarts Battle, but probably wouldn’t be into anything with deeper mechanics.
I wish they weren't using a dice battle system. I'm generally not a fan of similar systems (Armello comes to mind), that combined with the length of the battles and repetition means I'll have to give it a miss. It's a shame, because it sounds like it'd be right up my alley otherwise. Last edited by sicariase on Sat Jun 22, 2019 4:02 pm
I actually played it when it came out, but my group really didn't get into it. We felt like it didn't have much of a sense of pacing. The (lack of) mana system meant everyone was throwing out huge creatures from the first turn.
I thought the whole idea of that system was to be strategic about when you play your big threats, because you could play a giant monster on the first turn only to have it wiped by an opponent's single card; you needed to bait out cards like those before you play the big cards.
Was hoping for a little more information on what actually happened in Argentina with the title as it is.. With that said the 1st thing that jumped to my mind when I heard about it was a solar flare or something due to the scale of the outage, not (earth based) weather like being suggested, Will be interesting to see what actually went wrong to have it go SO wrong.
Power grids all over the world are ill-equipped to handle several simultaneous errors at once. I remember the great Nordic power outage in 2003, which occurred simply because the grid could not handle two major events within 15 minutes, the first being a SCRAM at a nuclear power plant followed by a short at a major switching station, at which point the power production on the grid is no longer able to keep up with the demand and the power plants disconnects from the grid one by one like dominos to protect themselves from overloading. It is easy to imagine that heavy rains and floods could produce similar circumstances. Last edited by aup on Sat Jun 22, 2019 7:10 am
What this means is we've done a good job of securing the bulk electric system, which is the primary thing we need to do. Its not that it is 'less about' hardening the key infrastructure, but that further hardening of distribution side is a place where we can even do more. Since that part is very segmented its not as high a risk target (from a national security perspective). Even if you can somehow cause some coordinated disturbances on the distribution end (which is quite difficult to pull off), those can still be isolated at a higher level, and the restart paths are well defined, protected, and plans in place on how to recover. We don't need to prevent 100% of potential disturbances. Local blackouts are typically no big deal and of very short duration. We can keep working incrementally to be more secure and use good practices throughout. Last edited by ThinkingMore on Sat Jun 22, 2019 7:29 am
Iambase current reports are that something happened in the line connecting one of the major generators (Yacyreta dam) on the grid to the rest of the country, and the alternative route was down for repairs. So the grid suddenly lost something like 1/4 of their generation and there was nothing to speed up to cover that failure. It was early in the morning and demand and generation were in their lowest levels, that's why that big dam was so much of the whole grid.
OK so how does this fit into the article's narrative that 'extreme weather events' (aka climate change) were the base cause? Seems it is a bit early in the game to blame this thing on any one or several causes. Yes, climate change is real, anthomorphic, and going to cause a lot of hurt. No, climate change isn't the only thing we're screwing up on. I'm a bit disappointed in Ars with this newer tendency to grab some fairly useless Wired article and repost it. If you're going to repost Wired, use some of their better articles at least.
US grid operators are constantly monitoring to identify when conditions present risk and take precautions. They do things like ask critical generator operators to stop doing any work that might accidentally trip a generator off line, levelize output among more generators, and verify adequate ancillary support is available and ready. They also may have load management capability to fall back on. Sounds like Argentina knew they had a higher risk situation, but did not take all the steps they could have to mitigate that risk.
Uruguayan here (neighbor to Argentenians), and Electrical Engineer (not working on energy gen/distribution but telco currently while most of my friends work on energy ). While we also did have a blackout last sunday, it was not as severe time wise, it was a 100% blackout although in fairness all power was restored within 1-2 hour and most people didn't notice cause it was started at 7 AM (near the Argentina border where the incident started and where we have a shared hydroelectric dam, was restored within 15-20 minutes) The official explanation back here was that one of the main distribution high power lines, Yaciretá-Salto, got messed up by a storm and for precaution was isolated from the rest of the grid... bad move, as protections got triggered because of the frequency disturbance. Why did it affect 100% of Uruguay then? Because nowadays our 3 million people country generate more energy than it consumes so most of the time we sell what excedes our consumption rate to Argentina. If we can't sell that energy, and can't store it either...kaput. Or at least that was the official explanantion. Now, unnoficially? Looks like one of the private-managed Argentina power distribution companies messed up taking the whole interconnection systems with them, the joke last sunday was they were more concerned tweeting automated Father's Day greetings than explanantions. And if you wanna get more tinfoil-hatty, there where elections that day on some provinces on southern Argentina, so... campaign is pretty heated up these days between right-wing Macri that's looking for a re-election in the middle of an economic crisis and left-wing Kirchner that holded power previously,according to Macri they got Argentina in this mess and according to Kirchner is all Macri's fault. Yeah, we got popcorn on this side, spectating Argentinians beat each other is kinda of our national sport
A big storm was the cause of the Yacyreta failure, these storms and floods are getting more usual nowadays (I guess the ""uy"" on @fenris_uy referes that he's from Uruguay as I am)
These storms are not due to climate change. The cloud corridor moving from Amazon to Paraguay/Uruguay/South of Brazil has always existed and it rains a lot in a stagnant manner where it meets a cold polar mass. Very similar to hurricane Harvey and Houston flood. Not a surprise the world largest power producing dam Itaipu is in this basin. And every year it may shift more to the north ou south causing local people to remember said year as a flood year.
Designing in redundancy is one thing - having it work in practice is another. The Kegworth Air Disaster is a classic example. An engine failure in a 737 shouldn't a fatal condition, given it's a twin-engined plane ... unless the pilots shut off the wrong engine, and then can't restart because auxiliary power depended on the engine ... (to be fair to the pilots, there were mitigating circumstances behind their error) Other examples I've seen include a data centre with a quadruple power distribution system fail because of the combination of scheduled maintenance, a failure in a power transfer switch and operator error in isolating the wrong circuit. I've seen a national data service designed with multiple redundancy go kaput because some of the circuits had been plugged into the wrong ports, meaning the network topology wasn't as designed (this was in the days of static routing, with a pair of Tandem fault-tolerant minis managing the network and calculating the routing separately from the switches - the switches themselves were trying to warn the operator that the topology was mixed up, but the sheer volume of warning messages overwhelmed the telco's out-of-band management network, and so they turned the logging level down ...) If there's a lesson, it's yes we need to design in as much redundancy as possible, but we also need to be humble about how well our equipment and people can cope under the pressure of multiple failures, be prepared for everything to go tits-up, and know how to restart everything from scratch if it does.
What I’m reading in this story is “la la la, can’t happen here!” Which is funny, given how many times it’s happened here, in my lifetime.
What we don't get to read about is the many significant events that do happen, but the grid handles reliably.
The more mishaps that occur, the more people will begin looking at operating microgrids or having onsite energy generation and storage as a remedy, as the story suggested.
Someone tell the Republican party -- the party of rugged individualism and self-reliance -- that series hybrid vehicles would put an electrical generator in every home, and rooftop solar would further reduce reliance on external infrastructure. These are things they might want to look into supporting. Wait, was that the Republican party? Or is that the party of entrenched business interests who spout racist dog whistles to con the uneducated lower class into thinking they actually work for them. I can't keep those straight.
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=argentina+power+blackout To summarice, lack of maintenance in a power station made things way worse that they could have been had things been done right.
From the Energy sub-section of the 2017 US Infrastructure Report Card, the one that gave US infrastructure a D+ rating. Quote: Much of the U.S. energy system predates the turn of the 21st century. Most electric transmission and distribution lines were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s with a 50-year life expectancy, and the more than 640,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in the lower 48 states’ power grids are at full capacity. Energy infrastructure is undergoing increased investment to ensure long-term capacity and sustainability; in 2015, 40% of additional power generation came from natural gas and renewable systems. Without greater attention to aging equipment, capacity bottlenecks, and increased demand, as well as increasing storm and climate impacts, Americans will likely experience longer and more frequent power interruptions. Parts of this infrastructure was built back when we were first installing electrical capacity in our cities, then most of it back before climate change started to really kick in, and it was designed accordingly. Obviously we need to start designing with our new climate in mind. Thank God coal is dying in the US... too bad about China, India, and elsewhere, though.

“There is clear evidence that extreme weather events have increased over the past 20 years, and so have the number of outages and the number of customer hours out of service,” or “There is clear evidence that over the past 20 years increasing population and aging underfunded infrastructure have increased the number of outages and the number of customer hours out of service,”
Porque no los dos? The former pair of claims is way easier to get clear evidence for. Your proposed claim includes causation which is far harder to establish.
Can't have a single failure bringing the entire system down. Local utilities should have spunned up generation assets. They didn't do so because of cost. And sealed their faith.
I am in Argentina right now and we had a blackout from 7AM to 4:30PM. The official report is not out yet, but apparently it was a combination of 3 factors: 1) one 500kV line connecting the Yacyreta dam was down to replace a tower. 2) the second 500kV line to Yacyreta had a failure 3) the system started shutting down power plants in cascade as it could not cope.

I guess it's news if you can add ""Climate Change"" to it. Doesn't have the gravitas without it and the broad lessons to be learned. Wish the article had more nuts and bolts instead of fluff.
Indeed. Both statements are not mutually exclusive but each condition can-and will-exacerbate the other. It's not an either/or situation. Last edited by daveishere on Sat Jun 22, 2019 11:28 am
Just kidding though. Here's hoping at least one country in the region stays sane.
Put a joint in the dog’s mouth and you’re on point.
Ohio was not an “overgrown” tree. It was an “untrimmed“ tree.
Please stop cross-posting articles from Wired and other Naste properties. If I wanted to read Naste articles, I'd visit those sites.
Load shedding should be automatic in a situation like that. You can't wait for someone to flip a switch.
This is cosmically ironic. Stupid should be painful.
It is automatic. That’s why it shuts down in a cascade.
Or a mate straw on the cup. And a thermos too.
You're correct that the storms themselves aren't due to climate change. However, you're sadly and blatantly incorrect in implying that climate change has nothing to do with this. Climatologists have long agreed that storms will continue mostly in the same frequency and places they've always been since the last ice age. What will be different, as a direct result of climate change, will be the SEVERITY of the storms. Climate change is expected to intensify storms that are most impacted by water vapor in the air and heat (since more heat leads to more water vapor, intensifying storms). That makes the once routine storms MORE DANGEROUS since they're becoming much more intense than before. Throw in a normally intense storm that's been further enhanced by more water and heat, and you get much more deadly and damaging storms than ever before. That's all directly due to climate change. So you might want to revisit your out-of-context post there. Implying that storms can't cause problems just because the region has storms all the time is naive. Severe and damaging storms do happen even without climate change adding to them. Overlooking the fact storms in general become more intense due to climate change, and can change an intense storm into a catastrophic one is just plain ignorant. Advertising that ignorance with a post like yours is, knowingly or not, propagandist bullshit. But I suspect you knew that already.
""'Extreme weather events are becoming much worse and there are more of them,' Silverstein says."" Guess he hasn't read the IPCC reports, which say they have low confidence that this has happened.
Climate change does add to the risk that these events will occur more often. It is something that the power grids of the world are going to need to take into account and be more resilient. In this case, a redundant path being down for maintenance is probably the prime reason for the outage. Assigning the blame for the outage to climate change seems a bit of a stretch. Edit: We do not do ourselves any favours by attributing climate change to events were it is clearly not the primary cause and plays into the hands of those who claim climate change is fake.
If there's a cascade of failures then the automatic load shedding has failed to do it's jobs. What we want is an automatic load shedding system which preemptively turns of power sections of the grid ahead of the cascade in order to avoid the cascade.
Agree. *In this specific case*, it's more than a bit of a stretch. The validity of climate change doesn't need any click bait. Scientific fact doesn't need propaganda efforts. In this case, it seems to be cherry picking and that does none of the issue any favors. Edit- IOW, the storm's severity may have been caused by climate change, but the storm was not the prime cause for all of Argentina to be blacked-out.

I had a subscription to Wired. Fluffy articles like this one are the reason I don't. And a reason why I have one for Ars. Let's keep Ars about tech/medicine/IP/Science/games and culture. We don't need fluffy puffy articles about headlines that have little to do with the empty substance. Of course, what would a honest headline be: Here's a bit of nothing. Oh, it's a Seinfeld episode. A little bit of nothing.
I have a degree in EE, in power engineering. I don't have a hands-on experience in distribution systems, but I had a course on the topic and if recall correctly the basic terms, last two statements are incorrect. In Europe, distribution network is made in rings. There is set of transformers in the ring. Each transformer supplies its neighborhood. The line that is supplying them goes in ring. If some segment of the ring fails, every transformer can be supplied from the other side. If the transformer itself fails, the neighborhood is in the blackout. But the damage is contained to one neighborhood. In USA they connect entire city in one big grid/web. If a transformer goes down, other transformers will take a part of it's load. You cannot have a situation that one neighborhood goes to the blackout. But if too many transformers go down, the entire city goes black and it is very hard to bring entire city back. Not sure how Argentinians arrange their distribution network, but on events on this scale, it is actually transmission network that should handle things. Both transmission network (100kV and above) and distribution part of the network (35kV, 10kV) are separated by a lot of switching gear. So it is very easy to segment out the part of the network that is in short-circuit. Actually there is a lot of protection equipment in charge for automatically turning off problematic part of the network. (And there is a number of my university-mates earning nice amount of money for knowing to properly configure the protection equipment.) So the statement that tree-like structure of the network makes the problem is dubious - yes, it is a problem, but it is a solved problem.
Th IPCC reports say that weather events will get worse. It doesn't say there will be more weather events. It says there will be more extreme weather events. It's a nuance. If you have 10 weather events on average in any given year, and 2 of them are extreme, you've set a baseline of extreme weather events in any given year on average. If you being to see more extreme weather events in those 10 normal weather events, then the number of extreme weather events have increased, even if the number of OVERALL weather events remains the same. The IPCC report is unequivocal about that. And saying there will be more extreme weather events is correct, even if the number of overall weather events remains essentially the same. The low confidence is saying that the number of overall weather events has increased. Generally speaking, they haven't. Perhaps you misinterpreted this. As I said, it's a nuance, but one that pretty much predicts that all weather events in the future will be more extreme than they were in the past, even when a ""new average"" for 'extreme event' is established, and resets the bar higher in order to be called an 'extreme event'.
If you have a pure tree structure it's simple. a) If you have an open circuit type failure then everyone down stream of that failure will lose power.b b) If you have a short circuit type failure then a circuit breaker will pop and everyone down stream of that breaker will lose power. But if you have a structure with parallel paths (ring, mesh, etc) it gets trickier. c) If you have an open circuit type failure then power is re-routed across the other paths and nobody loses power d) if you have a short-circuit type failure multiple breakers will open until power is cut to the short circuit leaving only the people who share the segment with the short without power But there's a big catch, which is more easily explained in case of c). As normal load is automatically transferred to other paths it may exceed their capacity. And thus breakers will open on other paths, putting even more load on the remaining paths and so on. This leads to a cascading failure where most of the grid can lose power. And this is probably what happened in Argentina, the same way it has happened in other large scale blackouts: one path was off for maintenance, another failed due to weather. Remaining paths got overloaded and breakers opened putting even more load on remaining paths which proceeded to to the same. To avoid this type of cascade you need something else than the normal circuit breakers which protect the hardware from overloads. You need a system which monitors the entire grid, recognized the start of a cascading failure and preemptively turns off power for some end users in order to avoid overloading the paths which are working well.

Dangit, just when graphics cards were getting reasonably priced again. Here I am, needing an upgrade.
If it keeps going I can start mining in the winter again and turn off the heaters (I have electric heat sadly).
You could do that anyway... doesn't 1000 watts consumed by a computer generate just as much heat as 1000 watts from a resistive heater? I need to check that theory.
Well, that's about all you'll gain from mining Bitcoin now: heat.
There's a cost involved in going from a heat pump to a stack of chips as your heat source.
Maybe it’s because cities and corporations are paying huge ransom in bitcoin. /s
Yes but that cost all turns into heat too. ETA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-jmSjy2ArM
I could but it isn't worth the effort unless the mining is going to pay for the heating bill (I did this back during the last surge). I suppose it would be kind of funny to replace my electric in-wall heaters with old inefficient PC components running Prime95 and tie them to the thermostat.
Not even /s. There are people having to buy hundreds of thousands of bitcoin at the market rate, as soon as possible. That's bound to drive prices up. Supply and demand!

I could but it isn't worth the effort unless the mining is going to pay for the heating bill (I did this back during the last surge). Really? Barring home users with an extensive mining farm of GPUs or ASICs, home mining really hasn't been all that profitable for years. Yeah, you may generate the heat needed to lower the bill, but in terms of value per heat or monetary performance, mining at least Bitcoin in the last few years has not at all been a worthwhile endeavor for home users. Even since the last crash, the difficulty has doubled.
This is a deeply silly chart. If you look at a longer-term stock price chart on a logarithmic scale, you'll see that the stock market had been going up at a pretty steady pace for decades preceding the 2000 peak. The boom of the last 10 years just gets us back to the trend line of the 1950-1990 period.
Yes, but you should use a heat pump.
Your choices are to convert energy to light, sound, and heat. Mostly you will get heat.
You can't get away with claiming this in an article about Bitcoin hitting $10k. I know Ars readers are vehemently anti-bitcoin because they love their cheap gaming rigs, but c'mon.
The end result is always heat.
Pedophiles and ransomware makers and drug dealers and speculative 'investor's' rejoice!
I don't think that makes a dent compared to the billion of Tether they have ""printed"" in the last year.
There's a good reason I do not participate in Bitcoin on principle. I wager that the value of whatever it is is driven solely by illegal enterprises like ransomware and seedy black markets. By engaging in this economy, I'm propping it up and, should I make money off of it, I feel the gains are wholly illegitimate and fueled by rampant speculation and the misery of many an IT department. No good can come of this, and I'm more at peace to ignore it entirely. Money can be made in more honest ways.
On the other hand, I bought a few bucks worth ages ago when a few bucks could actually get you something, so I don't have to pretend to have principles because I missed out.
Clearly your middle name is not pedantic.
Thermodynamics, how does it work? I expect this sort of comment in the local-interest section of the city paper...
Who the heck has to buy hundreds of thousands of bitcoins at market? A hundred thousand bitcoins would be 1 billion USD today.
I’m sure this thread will turn out well.
This is good for Bitcoin.
The vast majority ends up as heat. Most people wont have their monitor on any more than they would normally in this situation, so take that out of it. Not even sure changing bits on a drive results in potential energy. Again, mostly heat.
It's hundreds of thousands [ of dollars ] in bitcoins - $600,000 right here: https://arstechnica.com/information-tec ... get-worse/
no, we're vehemently anti-bitcoin because it's fucking stupid.
people win money at casinos and with lottery tickets too. 'cept they don't go around bragging like lucking out at gambling somehow makes them really smart.
In other news, I'm certain that investment I made in tulip bulbs will pay off. Aaaaaaaaaaaany day now...
Bitcoin is dumb for a number of reasons. 1 - Ecologically damaging because all of the power and heat in search of yet another attempt to create money from thin air. 2 - Regardless of what supporters will tell you, Bitcoin is most definitely used for ransom ware payments and buying fentanyl off the Dark Web^TM and other bad things w a y more often than legitimate things. And finally 3 - People in China and Iceland and other places with cheap electricity buying all the GPUs up makes me want to die a little.
The only people that like Bitcoin are outrageously lucky they happened to get in at a good time and made tons of money off it. Being that smug about anything is a good way to make literally everyone hate you.
I feel like we need a federal law stating that states, cities, and federal departments may not pay the ransom. I would not be opposed to prohibiting private payment as well.
So true. Sad, but true.
Yeah I'm not sure my current company would fair very well in that case either. Our main product SQL servers are 2008 r2 which we are finally looking to upgrade pretty much out of necessity at this point. We recently had some work done on the power over the weekend and had half a dozen or so processes that failed afterwards because apparently the servers running them didn't come back up correctly after the power work but IT's monitoring didn't see anything wrong. Going back even further we migrated a bunch of infrastructure from one data center to another and it took an entire weekend to accomplish and then most of the rest of the week fixing issues here and there. I think we have backups but I have no idea how good they are and I doubt we could fail over to a backup data center if we wanted to. To be fair to my current company the current management seems to be trying to do something to fix this but they've got a big technological debt to work through. My previous job I was a bit more involved with the IT side of stuff and knew what our backup plan was and could even restore things myself. I also know that they do annual testing of the fail over process for the data center over the weekend so I'm confident they are far better off than my current company.
I wonder well financially cyber insurance companies are doing...
Or we could just make cryptocurrency illegal. For the few and far between cases where it has benefits, compared to the pain it causes such as ransomware, money laundering and other illegal activities, it seems like we should just ban it.
Right. I suggest making drugs illegal too. Should work. /s
The payout rate is probably much higher as there are many ""Data Recovery"" firms that just take the money and turn around and pay the ransomware guys anyways. Victims may or may not know that's what they're really doing. https://features.propublica.org/ransomw ... g-hackers/
So, we invent this wild, wide-open, insecure internet gadget, and then (over a period of many years) decide to connect up our banking, government and infrastructure control systems, using off-the-shelf consumer grade operating systems. Gee, what could possibly go wrong. If we had a chance to do it all over again, would we make the same stupid mistakes? Last edited by Nora Lenderbee on Fri Jun 21, 2019 5:14 pm
Having no first hand knowledge of ransomware, how much could be protected simply by setting write permission or ownership. Or does the attack come from root?
Traditionally, governments have had far more success controlling money. They likely could enforce that transactions occur in dollars, not bitcoin, game points, etc. The inability to easily exchange a medium of exchange is pretty bad for its survival.
I feel like a loop: 3 copies!, 2 off line!, 1 off site! If you can’t afford to maintain it, you can’t afford to buy it! Drill your recovery procedures. You will perform as you practice! People are the weak link. Don’t scare them, mock them, or threaten them - teach them and make the ‘right’ choice the easy choice. It’s not rocket science. It is expensive. The cloud can help, but does not absolve you of responsibility.
I think today's xkcd is pretty timely for this article's publication.
While I don't expect it would stop ransomware attacks, cutting off the attacker's ability to receive payment is a very good strategy, with benefits that extend well beyond that. I've been wanting Bitcoins to DIAF for years for a lot of reasons, mostly because as far as I've been able to determine, they only facilitate money laundering and criminal activity. This at a major cost to society in terms of wasted energy. Not a solution to shitty IT practices, granted, but it MIGHT buy cities and other institutions some time to get their shit together and figure out how to harden themselves against malware/ransomware attacks. And the world in general will be better off, too.
I wish more governments adopted and expanded E-Estonia's software stack.
I've been thinking the same thing recently. Is this legally possible? I mean, we couldn't prohibit people from making lawful payments, but these are clearly criminal activities. Is there a legal issue with prohibiting private payments in these instances? Sure people would still do it, but it would stop the more high profile cases. And that's something.
Idealy ransomware will hit a high privileged account like root. The only real protection is offline backup of offsite backup you can cut it off so it doesn't get killed off at the same time. As i suppose some ransomware in the future will get to that level. Basically when it gets to News Worthy levels. There is no backup or the backups are also ransomwared.
Yes, it's expensive and that's the problem. People hate taxes and IT security is way, way, way down the list of what they're willing to pay for. If you look at most city budgets, there's always a fight over every last dollar. That means you're trying to value something that might happen (getting hacked and ransomed) vs. something tangible like having potholes filled or the trash picked up. I don't expect this situation to get better simply because taxpayers won't pay for it.
To add to this: security boundaries. Why should Jane in accounting clicking on not_a_virus.pdf.exe affect the PD's dispatch network?
Congress would need to write and pass a law, but I see nothing that would stop that. It is not as if this is likely to be a partisan issue, and I doubt the ones asking for ransom make campaign contributions. They prohibit private payments for several reasons already, this would not be new. We would still see businesses pay it sometimes, but it would greatly impact profits, and should stop cities from doing so.
The counter point is simple: If you can find them to target them with a drone strike, you can send in troops to arrest them and put them on trial them like a civilized nation.
If a municipality can't afford to run itself properly, then it should be disbanded and the services it provided should be handled by the next government up. There's really no reason to have as many shitty small local governments as we have. For most of the things local government does, there are economies of scale where it's cheaper for one large organization than many small ones. We might as well get started on that now, a huge number of municipalities will go bankrupt once auto-driving is good enough that the ticket money dries up.
Maybe I am not ready enough on this site, but I have no idea about what you are speaking about.
They have a looming pension issue in some cases as well, which realistically cannot be met. If our state and federal governments were proactive at all, they would be on top of how to do an orderly shutdown of a city government, discharging them from their debt, and dissolving the government such that it is once again unincorporated. Really, they should have more stringent requirements on incorporating as a city.
No, no. Cryptography. That is the source of all that ails our safety. Privacy of communication should be illegal. Law abiding citizens have nothing to hide. Right? /s (for the sarcasm impaired)
I feel like extraordinary rendition is a better option. Throw them in a hole and let them never see the light of day (or computer monitor) again.
Even in private enterprise. Be it taxes or race-to-the-bottom product prices or anything else. People are greedy and fucking cheap. They are also lazy, incompetent, ineffectual, and sociopathic, or forced into law of the jungle survival mode. The problem is systemic across EVERYTHING. My gf works at a medium high level at a major, world-class hospital consortium. The stories she tells me about security, crazy employees, incompetent managers making $700k per year, etc. are terrifying. Of course, having spent 20 years in software myself I've seen things no one should see and be able to ever sleep soundly again. The awful truth is, no one gives a shit. No one person can because effecting change is neutralized in a sea of human failings.

The problem with an email based attack is you can't depend on the idiot clicking on your link to be in a position of power. I'm guessing they pwn a machine then work their way around the network. Probably all machines start their encryption at the same time so there is no advance knowledge of the attack.
The problem is users usually have permission to access the files they use. Applications by default are usually run with the user's permissions therefore anything they can access, so can the application. Without a robust backup strategy (that also guards against poisoning) the malware doesn't need root to be devastating. After all, chances are good that at least one user really does need write access (or is given it anyway). The best fix, in addition to robust backups, is to use an entirely different model for access. A capability based system can deny a process access to everything by default. Then individual applications can be given a ""capability"" that grants them access to a particular type of resource. For example, there's no reason a browser needs access to C:\Super\Secret\Files\ so it wouldn't be given a capability that includes that access. Both iOS and Windows' UWP use this model to varying degrees.
OK we found them (unlikely in real life). They're in Russia. What now?
Oh, sorry. So, a while ago, Estonia was the target of a massive Russian DDOS attack. Having a very progressive-thinking government at the time, they have massively improved their software infrastructure and created the most sophisticated national digital government. It is so comprehensive that there are only three situations where one has to interact with the government in person: marriage, divorce, and transfer of property. They have never been hacked or crippled since. All their infrastructure is backed up, so they can even run their country from abroad. Estonia has open-sourced their software and offers other governments help in adopting it and best practices in running a digital government. Last edited by Don Reba on Fri Jun 21, 2019 6:39 pm
Someone please explain to me why a single clueless employee's random click can get through the organization's protections to kill multiple systems across the entire organization. Are smart switches, active firewalls, and the like so sophisticated and expensive that cities cannot afford the cost? I'm not the IT guy but am I naïve to believe that the Ubiquity switches, up-to-date Sophos firewall, anti-malware software, and standard backup practices we have will offer sufficient protection?
Every function of every government agency in Estonia is done digitally. If you reside in Estonia, or are a citizen of Estonia, you have a digital ID that you use for everything. I read a story about an arrest warrent being delivered digitally to an alleged perp, who went to turn himself in, only to be told he was wasting their time. The paperwork was done when he recieved the warrent. Please show up in person, in court.
Well that is a classic government issue, created by elected politicians. It's not an excuse not to do security well. In fact, now that Baltimore is going to be paying many extra millions in recovery costs, their pension issue just got a little bit worse.
1. their internal network was probably flat, with no segmentation 2. no internal firewalls 3. windows firewall not turned on 4. no AV with anti ransomware capabilities 5. poor mail filtering (though even good filtering will see things get through) 6. no software whitelisting 7. no privilege management
It looks like it was built using early 2000s 3d-animation tools. Ugly.
I was curious so I thought I'd at least install it and take a look. Turns out somehow ""worldwide release"" does not include Canada? :\
""Wizards Unite's collect-a-thon extends from foundables to a seemingly endless variety of items that can be acquired in the Inns and Greenhouses scattered about in the real world (in the exact same places as Pokémon Go's Pokéstops and Gyms, amazingly enough)."" Mainly because they're all taken from Niantic's first game, Ingress, which is how they can be added, approved (level 15 and 16 players), and the photos added. the tracing and speed comes from Ingress also (Glyph hacking), and the backstory also comes from Ingress.. There are some issues, like the randomness of things popping up, and yes, the loadtime (and battery usage, on a par with Ingress Prime). All in all, it's a bit different, and the lack of energy except by hitting inns (and hte randomness therein) along with the paucity of energy possible (75 max) means you're likely to run out, especialy if there's no inns nearby (at least Ingress you pull the action energy from all around, and can recycle items for more energy, and keep energy cubes [including branded Circle-K ones in the past] to keep going. On a difficulty level, it's not as quick+simple as PoGo, nor as strategic+complex and 'multiplayer' as Ingress, but somewhere in the middle. Ingress player since year 2, and level 8 WU player.
So from what I see, it's Pottermore fed through an Ingress filter. Can't say I'll use it, but I know some of my HP-loving friends will.
Ehhh...I'm sure there's an audience for this, but personally I'd rather play the leaked Harry Potter RPG.
Well of course it isn't included in the worldwide release as Canada is a fictional country.
Canada certainly exists, but statistically speaking there's a decent chance that Finland doesn't actually exist.
Yeah, I couldn't get into Pokemon Go because I'd already played Ingress, so why would I start over with basically the same game with the same locations but different skin. I guess maybe they're trying to capture yet another slice of gamers who would never play Ingress or Pokemon Go?
I long for the day when gamers can look back and laugh at how stupid that we, as a people, accepted games that incorporated crappy micro-transactions and ""pay to release the time-lock"" mechanics.
The horcruxes were the collecting things part of Harry Potter. Not sure they were ""magical things"", but I'm assuming there's some licensing agreement as to why they didn't just do a Harry Potter find the horcruxes and beat the evil wizard kind of game. Throw in a lot of ""decoy"" horcruxes and it could have been a natural fit to the Pokemon Go idea for a Harry Potter game.
Well, it already takes place in a mythical world, why would they release it in a mythical country? edit: ninjaed. Last edited by whiteknave on Fri Jun 21, 2019 1:15 pm
There were only seven horcruxes, right? The ratio of decoys to real ones might have ended up a bit ridiculous for an ongoing game...
Seven's a good number. That's about as many of these encounters as I could stand before I declare victory and uninstall this.
If Finland doesn't exist, then Lordi is the greatest hoax ever.
One can always ignore the microtransactions and pay to release time-locks. I'm level 47 (max level: 50) on Elder Scrolls: Blades and have yet to give them any money.
Yes an no. There's an end-game, I'm assuming. And the potential for releasing other things. The idea I had was to have Voldemort have seven real horcruxes, and hundreds or thousands of false leads. There would be a randomizer that had a chance at finding the real ones, with increasing difficulty as one progresses. But along the way, one has to gather friends, and forces in order to take him down (because just because he CAN be killed, doesn't mean it'd be easy). So, the whole ""gathering"" thing is there. And even the location thing. Then you can set up arenas where folks spar and practice (like the room of Requirement) with the forces they have all in preparation for the big take-down (which COULD mean if you don't have sufficient forces, you don't win and have to start again since Voldemort could escape and make new horcruxes). I mean, the potential was there, even if there were only 7 horcruxes. It would only take some imagination and (probably) some license agreements to make a sort of ""real life"" Harry Potter thing based on the premise of finding things in the real world and then ""fighting"" them in ""arenas"".
Remember when being a 'AAA title' meant desirable gameplay that leveraged cutting edge hardware capabilities... Back before it meant ""we spent all our money on the license so we couldn't afford to actually finish the game?""

No, I don't.
You say that, but there are fewer licensed games these days than gens 3-7. Also AAA has never meant anything more than budget size.
I was turned off from playing by the length of the setup process. Also, the map didnt load in my semi-new neighborhood (which does show up in Google Maps), so I can't even do anything anyway. I enjoy Jurassic World Alive more.
It's always sad because the Harry Potter universe is on Star Wars scale of easy to make tie-in video games from the existing and extended lore, if not easier. VR game -- just clone about 70% of the drag the mouse in a pattern Unreal Engine games from a decade ago, but now do it with the hand / motion controller. Mobile AR game -- let people battle on the streets while learning the patterns to draw on screen and collecting RPG style magic boost items. Project house cloaks on player characters. PC game -- Do a 3rd person, Diablo style or 1st person Elder Scrolls RPG. But instead got the lacking UE games whose emptiness fits better with VR expectations. Mobile game -- steal the turn based dynamics and cutscene methods from Final Fantasy games, but using wizards and Hogwarts. Flight sim -- Crazy Taxi, but with the Weasley's car.

yeah just started playing this today, ex-hardcore pokemon player. slow, too complicated and not charming. who wants to go out and find a clock or umbrella instead of a magical creature? and besides that it requires you to do a lot of work just to be able to keep playing. refilling your energy (pokestops) takes a disproportionate amount of time to that of playing. i found the points they choose to diverge from the Go formula were more annoying than clever additions.
Seems like they missed the chance to build on the Magical Beasts franchise here. It's a much better fit than constantly rescuing known wizards.
Since this appears to take place after the events of the main series Snape must have had some horcruxes stashed away. Perhaps a hint that he's the mysterious dark wizard. You know that guy who always appeared to be bad, but in a twist he wasn't (just super messed up). Now he is the bad guy - what a twist!
Er, there's a lot of magical beasts, including stuff relating to Newt. It's pretty clear Kyle went into this not wanting to like it, and so didn't.
I'll have to disagree with Kyle there. I'm a L16 ingress / 40 pogo guy (who does anomaly fun stuff on the ingress side) The biggest problem lots of folks have with Ingress / PoGo is the lack of a plot and/or more 'game' things. HPWU does all that, abliet in the crashy niantic way. If you like potter and like AR, it's pretty much a instant obsession. You don't HAVE to microtransact (and really, I'm going to be a free player completely) unless you lack patience and/or don't want to walk around to get energy. It's a pretty good start with a new franchise. ... It's great for HP parties and locations and weakly tied to the reality locations which is what most people want anyway. No strategic level play (that's all ingress) but great in dense areas. There's a lot less walking (if that's your thing, stick with pogo for that), but it definitely ties you to your static location for a while.
Canada is the blank dark spot at the top of the CNN weather map.
Sounds complicated, but maybe I am getting old. Also, keep those damn Inns off of my lawn.
Unless you have a LFL on your lawn, that's not really an issue. There's also very little reason to stray from sidewalks in this.
No, there's the same walking as with PoGo. Instead of eggs and incubators, there's portkey portmanteau's and keys.
You can't even be a death eater. Uninstalled.
I kinda wonder if Pokemon Company would be okay with that. Battling/capturing/dealing with creatures might be too similar to Pokemon Go especially from the same developer. Maybe it’s just because I like Pokémon more than Harry Potter but I just don’t see the appeal at all. The concept doesn’t sound particularly Harry Pottery really. Pokémon Go at least makes sense. Pokémon has always been a franchise about going out into a world a catching monsters and that translates well to AR.
Doesn't have to be the same. It could be that you are finding magical beasts in traps and freeing them. Gotta release 'em all. Based on Andrew Norton's comment above, that may already be in there, and maybe what I am really suggesting is not having to free named characters multiple times each, which is a pretty trivial suggestion.
Old Voldy's gone moldy, and seven times dead. So there just aren't many death eaters around. But you can slytherin to a deatheater-looking mask thing for your user-selfie.

And what is a pokedex, but an elaborate sticker-book? *run* *duck* *hide*
Joking aside, I've agreed with most of the positive and most of the negative reviews thus far. I would say that I am not so much enjoying it as being dragged along by my Potter obsessed spouse, children, and friends. What I really want is a way of determining my heath, mana, and active buffs without entering combat. You know, basic RPG stuff.
I'm bitter that I got in yesterday and my usernames were already taken. Also because you can't use spaces, punctuation, or numerals in the username.
Or you know - Harry Potter fans? Whether they consider themselves a gamer or not.
YES... More.
Just. Can't. Wait!
I’m guessing the bulk of the mind flayer is still trapped in the Upside Down. What’s left in Hawkins is the part Joyce et al drove from Will at the end of season 2. We saw Eleven close the portal but the part of the Mind Flayer that crossed over via Will was seen fleeing into the night sky. Now I guess it wants to recombine. Could give a real Dawnof the Dead or Body Snatchers vibe if it’s infecting large portions of the town. Can’t wait.
Steve and Dustin holding a mysterious object of green goo in the 1980s... what could possibly go wrong? US government attempt to make weapons out of something horrible found in the upside down because that's what governments do, especially during the Cold War? US government makes The Ooze(tm) and accidentally make a bunch of teenage mutant ninja turtles? Guess we'll find out July 4th...
Wait, I thought Amazon was cancelling this!
Cary Elwes? Fuck yeah!
Well, there's about eight hours of my holiday weekend spoken for.
No, didn't you hear? They're cancelling christianity! Oh, wait - that was Netflix.
Ikr. Matthew Modine and now Cary Elwes. Maybe Ethan Hawke next season for a Reality Bites reunion?
Don't get my hopes up.
This is the summer of sequelitis, so there's room for optimism that Judaism 2 will get pulled for a reimagining. 😂
Love the music for the show... it's so 80s retro scifi horror/suspense... reminds me a lot of The Terminator, The Keep, and other movies from around that time.
Squeals in Eleven
You mean Millie Bobby Brown...
I loved last season, but with that really terrible and bizarrely shoe-horned episode with Eleven going off to find those stereotypes I was super nervous that this season was going to go off the rails and suck hard. But this trailer has really restored my faith and gotten me excited again.
I’m excited. I did their New Coke promotion since I was six when it came out and dear god, it’s terrible. Not as bad as Beverly though....
I can’t wait. I hope that by “going big” with the spectacle this won’t be a case of 1980s sequelitis!
I was worried about the same thing. It definitely looked like they wanted to take the series into a ""Misfits of Science"" type direction (short-lived TV show from the 80's starring pre-Friends Cortney Cox). Looks like the writers and showrunners acknowledged the mistake and righted the ship. Thankfully.
I didn't mind the breakaway itself, but it bothered me that it never paid off. They just dropped that whole storyline without revisit or resolution. Perhaps it was a setup for something that happens in this or future seasons, but it was just jarring having it abandoned.
I may be in the minority but I enjoyed that episode. It hit a lot of pleasurable nostalgia buttons relating to 80s hollywood’s strange notions of what cities and ruffians looked like, from Reaganite suburbia’s perspective. The guy with the Mohawk, the flick knife, the multiracial gang, all classic neon pastel-y tropes.
I'm still bummed that each season of Stranger Things isn't a new story with new characters in the Stranger Things universe. Shoehorning these characters into various situations meant an awful lot of treading water in season 2. There's so much more to explore beyond these kids in this time in this universe.
I’m also hoping they address the spraying in the tunnels the two character received at the end of last season.
That was an attempt at a backdoor pilot for some kind of superkids spinoff . . . thing. They (thankfully) put that idea out of its misery
""it was a refreshing love letter to a bygone era, when kid-centric films ... led the box office""...? Cough, cough, ""young adult"" fiction? There is way more teen-focused media today than there ever was in the 80s. Sure, it's of a different flavor, which is perhaps what you meant? I certainly enjoyed The Goonies et al much more than The Hunger Games, but I'm an Old and yell at the kids to get off my lawn.
""School’s out, there’s a brand new mall in town..."" According to Andrew Yang, there's a good chance this mall would have closed already or will be closing in the next 5 years.
Oh I did mind the breakaway itself. Not necessarily the idea of breaking away to tell a new story, but that every single new character in that episode felt like a weird cardboard cutout stereotype and it completely broke my suspension of disbelief. In contrast I feel like every single character from Hawthorne feels like a true 3-Dimensional human being, which is what really makes the show great.

It felt like a backdoor pilot for a spinoff. If they absolutely had to do it, I felt like it would have been a lot better to do something like release it as a standalone ahead of the rest of the season. Don't change anything else, just reinsert Eleven at the point in the story they did. It wasn't bad content or anything, but it really hurt the flow of the season to drop it in the middle of the season, so I think people would have reacted better to it if it'd been released separately.
""Seriously, though, hasn't this town suffered enough?"" Have you ever been to a small Indiana town? (I currently live in a small Indiana town.)
Squee!
I remember when Gwinnett Place Mall (filming location) opened. I went school shopping there many times as a middle schooler.
While I like Stranger Things, I'm looking forward to S2 of the German series Dark much more...
I loved the first season, and found the second one to be ""nice, but unecessary"". It's not bad per see, it's just that the first one was just so good, that I'd be fine with 11 being presumably dead to protect everyone. But I always walk on eggs when good series start having too many seasons => It's way too easy to ruin something good, and it doesn't even have to be a bad season. Sometimes, just overusing it kills the magic. I hope season 3 to be as good as the previous ones, or even better; but I'm not gonna watch it until I see reviews saying it kept the magic instead of killing it.
Dark was ok. It was sold to me as a friend as being an more adult Stranger Things. It had elements, but I'm ok with missing season 2 and just reading about it.
It's apparently available now on Netflix. Enjoy. Personally, I didn't care for it. It started out pretty well, but...I don't know, it just seemed to sort of wander around aimlessly. And where the hell was that town? Does it EVER stop raining there?
FWIW The Duffer brothers plan on the series ending after season 4, so I think it won't turn into a meandering mess.
Glad to hear it. There was talk for a while about doing at least 5 seasons and beyond, and as much as I've liked the show so far I don't think there's that much story to tell. I hope they have a beginning, middle, and end in mind, and are smart enough to confine themselves to that without padding. If they've got more stories to tell, that's fine, but tell them in their own series.
Apostate!
At the end of season two, I was wondering why they were going to do a season three since they had completed their storyline with basically no loose ends to wrap up. I wasn't looking forward to another season at all. This teaser has me thinking that I was wrong.
And someone, not but yesterday, suggested the notion of machines diagnosing and repairing themselves was far-fetched. Turns out, it's not that far-fetched. At all. Since they're almost doing that *now* for some of the most sensitive and precise equipment on the planet.
Grey Goo v0.1 (alpha)
that is incredibly cool. i'm kind of jealous, really -- i've always thought, ""there's just so much data everywhere, and what could i see, if only i could capture it?"" even if it's through a layer of AI and analytics, perceiving the world through that lens sounds amazing. but i do hope they avoid telling their machines to make things tastier.
They're providing diagnostics, not repair. Big difference. I work for a large industrial company doing something similar for preventive measures. We have a suite of sensors analyzed by Watson to look for patterns that presage component failures. A tech gets sent to replace or adjust stuff before a downtime event or entrapment occurs.
This is why you don't open the L-Gate!!!!!
Machines making machines? How perverse.
I'm curious about the heat island around the BME280 on the sensor board; the whole thing looks sunken. Any ideas of what's going on there? I've used that part before and know how sensitive it is. Also, it looks like they're using an ODROID-XU4 SBC.
This is cool! I'd heard of sensors placed on large machining equipment to detect abnormal vibration for similar purposes. But I had no idea they were monitoring fab conditions so closely.
If it was in some kind of AI thread then a lot of people still use the old meaning of AI as in actually self-learning and and self-acting system. Not a bit of deep learning that has been thought by humans what to look for which is what seems to be called AI nowadays.
Just be cautious when it tells you the AE-35 unit is going to go 100% failure in 72 hours.
Whatever it's listening to, it's doing it through the microphone. So the signal acquisition would hear both.
Fantastic read
When they start breaking down they'll start reporting data that's different from their neighbours and different from their historical trend. It wouldn't take much to realize that the sensor itself has failed, and I'd bet they've already mapped a bunch of failure profiles to the ML system.
Unless you know what you're doing.
I think it's an optical illusion caused by the edge of the ground plane.
That would be my guess, too. Just seemed like an omission when talking about this kind of analysis. It would be interesting to see the failure rate on the sensors as much as the robots. Naturally, the cost of a sensor is negligible, but that extra legwork to replace it gets costly too after a while. I'm guessing you would have to verify the next batch of results as soon as the new sensor is popped in to be sure. No ML pattern is perfect, just ""good enough"".
And the difference is, you guessed it, little more than semantics. A machine can easily be built to handle those purely mechanical, linear tasks. There's literally nothing special about the work involved that machines cannot already accomplish. In fact, the reason why people are still doing them has more to do with the fact that a person can perform a greater diversity of these simple tasks due to the innate nature of our biological tools, ie our hands. Robots performing these tasks would be too specialized to be cost effective. For now. Because guess what...robotic versions of our hands, with all the same faculties and more, are already being built (but not mass-produced, yet). Again, machines diagnosing and repairing themselves is not far-fetched. It's not even far-future. It's tomorrow's technology being developed and perfected today.

I think that depends on how much overlap there is in the sensor grid. If they set it up like an aircraft, you could have multiple redundant systems in place monitoring output, thus ensuring that any one sensor failure is unlikely to cause a systemic malfunction that requires rework.
This is something of a nitpick, but is ""camera"" the right term? We always called photolithography machines ""steppers"" back in the day. I'd think they'd more accurately be called projectors, since you're projecting the wafer pattern on the photoresist that's covering the wafer. You're doing the opposite of what in the photography world would be using an enlarger to project the image from a negative onto the photo paper.

Not yet, at least. OK, yeah, I am 100% certain you've never worked with industrial machinery. You seem to believe that diagnostics equate to problem-solving. Reading an error code, like on the OBDII port of a car tells you THAT there is a problem, not WHAT it is or WHY it happened. It's ridiculous to assert otherwise. Repair, preventive maintenance, and failure root case analysis are analytical processes that require a competent or expert technician. Even in the case of something as simple as a sensor failure, a further examination is necessary to prevent a game of replacement parts roulette. That's how you end up with crappy, expensive repairs that don't last, because you just threw money at the problem. Advanced diagnostics sensors and machine learning are great for pointing out to a human what the problem is, and its specific characteristics, but aside from the absolute most routine wear item replacement a machine is going to suck for a long, long time, because actually fixing shit requires a high-concept understanding of what makes a system tick.
Thereitis, I agree (calling them steppers or mask aligners). There could also be e-beam or laser ""direct write"" systems instead of optical projectors in some of those big boxy tools.
Pffft if they were using advanced technology they wouldn't need microphones, it would read lips.
That photo brings back bad memories about the first and last time I visited a fab clean room. Between the yellow lighting, noise, temperature and humidity of the air, and possibly trace chemical vapours I had a splitting headache within half an hour and couldn't wait to get out.
Most of this cool tech mentioned in this article has been in use in semiconductor for the last 10 years.
Stepper is correct. Also $70mil for a stepper is on the low side.
If the Fab you visited has trace chemical vapors in the cleanroom, and you can smell them, then they are doing a shitty job with employee safety. Where I work, ANY odor is too much odor.
Back in the day, when every high school had Drivers Ed, we were taught to keep an ear out for unusual noises from the engine, the tranny, or the wheels, and to treat those as signs that it was past time for some preventive maintenance. The catch, of course, is that people are really good at adapting to slowly changing sensory inputs. I want this technology on my cars!
This was a *long* time ago (four inch wafers!). I didn't smell anything specifically but it was not a comfortable place to be in. One day the arsine leak alarm went off and everyone had to evacuate the building (I worked in the same building as the fab) but it turned out to be false which was a very good thing. Arsine is roughly comparable in toxicity to hypergolic rocket propellants, i.e. very.
That was my thought, too, but the boundary looks weird, and it looks different from other areas without copper on the top layer. Can the absence of copper on inner layers cause the FR-4 to bend when bonded? I've never seen it on boards where there is a restricted area under a radio module's antenna, but maybe that has to do with layer thickness.

A solid state sensor and an embedded low power processor for data collection and shipping is probably ~3 to 6 orders of magnitude more reliable than a physical machine with nm tolerances.
That's incredible. It almost makes me forgive the price fixing.
thank god there are chemists in this world.... Arsine or any of the toxic chemicals doesn't sound like a solution you would try brute force.
I suggest you read up on the history of hypergolic propellants, then. Chemists are a wild and adventurous bunch. Ignition! by John Clark is an entertaining summary.
Yeah, I would have thought so too. Things like dust, water and shock can degrade those little MEMS microphones in devices out in the real world, but... none of those seem likely to be particularly big problems for a fixed installation in a clean room. I suppose you might still want to take some precautions, but I'd bet the useful life of such a sensor would normally be much (much) longer than the facility itself.

It'll probably be tomorrows technology for a few decades yet though, much like good old fashioned AI. Just as a side note however, I can assure you that nothing approaching the human hand is currently being developed. Replicating the levels of sensory feedback, force control and dexterity all within somewhat similar size constraints and with the required output force is far beyond current technology.

Though Im glad google is cleaning up their endless product offerings, this gives me no faith to adopt their future ones.
Actually, no -- this is at least the second Ars story today covering a dead or dying Google product. Please correct the article copy to read ""Not another day, another dead or dying Google product"" /s
What's the success for a niche product that likely have a small user base, but that base may be pushing a lot of revenue on YouTube?
Long term support isnt a selling point for sodas. Edit: its not really a selling point for youtube hangouts either, but for other Google offerings it is. Im not going to invest time into GCP if they shut it down next year.
Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead! *clink*
When I was a kid, I had a relative who worked for General Mills. Every Christmas, our family would receive as a gift a box of experimental food products. Most of these, we never saw again. A few went on to be mainstays -- I specifically remember trying Gushers many months before anyone else I knew. What General Mills did not do was spool up production and distribution to get these experimental products in every store, only to find out they were not popular enough to be profitable on their own, but sufficiently popular to get long-time customers of other General Mills products to stop buying those products, start temporarily buying the new product, then be left in the lurch when the new product was discontinued.
Basically anything that isn't core product like search, android, gamil, docs, maps or YouTube etc isn't successful for Google. Don't be surprised that many people won't even try Stadia or anything new from Google, because they know that even if it will be popular (used be millions of users) Google will kill it. Look and Inbox fot example.
""I'm not quite dead yet!"" *Whack*
The difference is that you don't have to build expensive infrastructure and processes specifically for consuming a different flavor of a product. If your business workflow is dependent upon the existence of a service, then you can't trust a service from a company that is constantly killing off services. This causes an issue where people believe they can't trust Google and so even Google's good services that could succeed may have trouble succeeding due to lack of usage stemming from lack of trust.

All other considerations aside, just how bad is Google at branding? I've owned Android phones for years, and I honestly can't tell what the 'Hangouts' brand is supposed to be or who it is supposed to be for. It is for casual social use? Business communications? Voice calls? Video chat ? Text chat? All or none of the above depending on the phase of the moon? Same with the 'Play' branding - is it for entertainment? Their various app|music|video|book stores? If that's true, why is 'Google Play Services' also the name for 'the good parts of Android'. The coming and going of products is bad enough, but I seriously can't keep straight what they do in the first place, which makes it awfully hard to care when they go away.
This product sounds like something which organizations pay big bucks for. The cost of running this for free probably didn't make a lot of sense for Google when their only real competitor, Twitch, doesn't offer similar functionality.
The traditional ""oh, that sounds like it might have been neat"" response when you only learn of a Google service as they're axing it.
But totally buy games on the Stadia platform!
Why not both? This is clearly not an enterprise tool. Giggle can be a FMCG company for consumers whilst simultaneously being a reliable supplier of enterprise software. Honestly, I don't have the knowledge to say if that's what they're actually doing.
Google is killing YouTube... FTFY Edit: Oh, come on. We all have seen how much YouTube is screwing over the content creators that made it great. They're crapping on creators and turning it into the next cable TV. They are killing it. Last edited by greevar on Fri Jun 21, 2019 11:45 am
At this point not one will take any service or app from google seriously... they always killing their best apps. I would not be surprise if youtube is also in their radar to be shutdown or replace in the future.

They kill those that don't succeed. Google is behaving no differently. When I was a kid, I had a relative who worked for General Mills. Every Christmas, our family would receive as a gift a box of experimental food products. Most of these, we never saw again. A few went on to be mainstays -- I specifically remember trying Gushers many months before anyone else I knew. What General Mills did not do was spool up production and distribution to get these experimental products in every store, only to find out they were not popular enough to be profitable on their own, but sufficiently popular to get long-time customers of other General Mills products to stop buying those products, start temporarily buying the new product, then be left in the lurch when the new product was discontinued. Actually they do. They’re a FMCG (Fast moving consumer goods) company. While they will have some stable product lines they also have products that are temporary following the latest food trends. Thats what FMCG companies do. Now, does that mean Google should act as a FMCG company? Perhaps? Why not both? This is clearly not an enterprise tool. Giggle can be a FMCG company for consumers whilst simultaneously being a reliable supplier of enterprise software. Honestly, I don't have the knowledge to say if that's what they're actually doing. But speaking of enterprise software, Google Hangouts (unrelated to Hangouts on Air) is a somewhat widely used enterprise tool as part of G Suite (and G Suite Enterprise) and it too is being sunsetted. People invested in conference room hardware around it who will now be shopping for Zoom Rooms compatible hardware. Some hardware will be compatible with 'Hangouts Meet', but not all. Google in the enterprise is a very love/hate thing. Last edited by r3ersx on Fri Jun 21, 2019 11:33 am
Cue the song, 'Another one bites the dust'. RIP Freddy.
""Google is killing [enter name of doomed service here]"" Well, if they announced the launch of a doomed service on Tuesday, this must be Friday...
Stadia, you're up!
If Google wants to try an experimental app (like Inbox), why not slap a 'beta' on it and say it's free until it's released, then charge a $5 subscription fee? Same for this current product Hangouts on air - seems like it's really convenient for some segment of users. Put a 'beta' label, and when it's ready for release, charge for it? I guess they hasn't consider this subscription model until Stadia? This erosion of customer confidence also affects developers too. I've decided to stop developing critical apps with Flutter b/c the chances of Google not supporting it tomorrow is a real possibility.
Never knew this existed. Then again, there probably wasn't any reason to kill it either. Oh well. Glad Android doesn't need gapps to function. At this point it is the only good decision Google made when they created it.
""Google killing a product/service..."" Drink!
For Google's services (and other platforms, to be honest): 1. Is there a cost charged to the end user? If no... 2. Does it seem to generate a lot of advertising revenue to be profitable, including covering ongoing development costs? If no... 3. Does user activity generate useful data unavailable from other sources to help improve algorithms for other profitable products? If no... I don't expect the product to last.
but just a sip of water. Anything stronger or in larger volume will result in toxicity.
I had no idea Hangouts On Air was still around. It was a Google+ thing. YouTube has a lot of hidden features huh?
I agree, and I have an anecdote from just yesterday. I had a work meeting with a group that has some kind of paid extension for hangouts. Or I should say, used to use hangouts. Now it's been forced to use 'meet'. I missed most of the meeting. I spent the majority of the time trying to debug Google's beta 'meet' product to try and actually hear the meeting. At this point, I wouldn't trust a google service paid or unpaid.
Another day, another Google product *Korg voice*
Without becoming GTA-style LifeInvader, Google really would be out of money. It’s a shame no one cares about that first bit.
Yeah...I gotta believe that this pattern will impact Stadia revenue, whether Google/Alphabet acknowledges it or not.
I can't recall, what's the replacement they have for Hangouts on G Suite? Our teams use Hangouts a lot (while within Gmail)
Yes and No. I wouldn't call it a big buck system per se, but you would certainly have to pair a couple things together to get the equivalent functionality. The real issue I see for YouTube is the old system ""just worked"" and had a vendor lock-in. If someone goes through the trouble of going third party they can move between streaming platforms with relative ease. I would say if anything they should be investing in more tools to make it easier to stream with the need for third party tools. Lock people in using the natural urge to be lazy.
At this pace, Ron won't have any more Google products to write about year end
I would think people capable of editing youtuber video and uploading them could probably figure this out easily, if they dont do it already; but yes, if you are a streamer of any sort, you will have an easier time (or you did or do this already). That said - it's still shitty, IMO, for Google to not keep this thing around. I guess they couldn't figure out how it helped their ad business.
Well maybe I am wrong, but MS and plenty of third parties seem to enjoy a free consumer offering that has some level of upsell (and may or may not have ads) OR consumer is free and enterprise has a cost (OR it's basically both of those things). Why can't Google do that? But also - sometimes something itself doesn't have to generate revenue IF it makes using something that does a better experience.
It may not be killing a service like they normally do, but does this count as another aborted project by Google? They may still be making laptops, but surely the tablet market is still a good one to be part of? If I was moving to an Android or ChromeOS based device then I'd be looking for Google hardware before any other manufacturers, to get (what should be) the best experience.
Now if I worked at Google, I would have taken the remaining stock and bundled them with a year of Stadia. Maybe add 75% of the cost for a Stadia bundle in a Google Plays Games Bundle. Once that stock sold out then I would announce the end of the Slate.
Chrome OS is the main issue, they need to give up on the idea of a crippled version of Linux shackled to Chrome.
I didn't think that it would be worth it to get another Android tablet made by Google because they were too expensive, but got this instead because I had to test something at work: https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/s ... ebooktab10 ChromeOS is actually useful as a tablet, I think Google's problem was trying to make a hybrid OS just like MS did. The stylus input is surprisingly useful too, it's got me to stop using anything else to take notes during meetings etc
The problem with everything Google hardware related since the unceremonious assassination of the nexus line until the pixel 3a is it's all been way too expensive for market disruption, and the pixel 3a isn't really cheap enough for it, anyway. The nexus line had it at least somewhat right, as a new market participant you have to undercut your competitors to gain market and mind share. Everything pixel has been overpriced except for the pixel 3a, which is still more expensive than a truly disruptive entrant should be, but at least it's a good product for an affordable price.
They've canceled an entire line of products so why wouldn't it count? I'm not really sure what Google was doing here. If you deliver products that seem like they needed a few more months of development before they were ready, doubly so going against mobile offerings from Apple, one would think they should at least be on the cheaper end of the spectrum, but nope. Apple polished iOS (and its soon-to-be iPad OS) to a mirror sheen, they've got the marketing and retail down, and the vertical integration they've worked on for years and years, resulting in them being able to design their own chips and not being beholden to someone else, like how Qualcomm's disinterest in smartwatch chips still apparently dooms Wear OS, has paid off immensely. Google really needs to stop with the ""fling crap at the wall and see what sticks; cancel and move on if it doesn't work out"" corporate ethos. People have noticed this, it makes at least some wary of trying new products, and it creates a feedback loop. And to be Captain Obvious, charging premium prices for a not-so-premium product also isn't such a good idea.
I loved the first Nexus tablets as a developer tool. Cheap enough, google offering firmware for all versions of android they supported, no vendor ""improvements"" to hinder your development. There is no reference Android development device today.
Not sure what version you're using, but ChromeOS is quite capable. Capable of not working! Haha. No, is actually quite functional for what it is. Adding Android apps helped a lot, aside from the locked window sizing on some apps. Great for school work when I don't want to give up my gaming laptop.
""Forever"" is a strong word there. Anyway, I like ChromeOS and use a Pixelbook for development. Excellent machine. I think Google should copy the Surface here and have a detachable keyboard for their already excellent Pixelbook. That gives people the tablet format if they want it. Personally, I'd buy that because flipping the keyboard back to make a tablet out of the Pixelbook for writing notes is awkward.
I see a significant difference between withdrawing a service that people are using and cancelling a line of products. If you bought a previous Google tablet you've still got it and it still works.
For myself, I tried a tablet (a nice waterproof Sony XZ something or other). But I just found the battery life and limitation of being stuck with apps too troublesome. Then I got a base model Surface 'tablet' and hot dang, no need to ever go the tablet route ever again. I am seeing fewer and fewer tablets kicking around these days given how good full on Windows machines have gotten in a similar form factor. I can't speak to how Apple Ipads are doing though - I would think ok given most (?) Mac notebooks don't have touch so you can't get that experience without being in the tablet space.
I think it's the same amount of time it will take them to announce the end of Stadia.
100% committed Ah, that phrase say so much with so little.
I've only played with an Intel-based Android device briefly. At the time, a lot of apps are only available for ARM-based devices. Is that still the case? If so, I can certainly understand why those tablets failed.
That's the beauty of it! Don't have to honor the offer and cleared out the Slates.
They also designed and polished their way to be the first US company with a $1 trillion US dollar market value. The audience also justifiably reacted to that stand's price with a collective gasp. Apple is by no means a perfect company, and I say this as someone who has had it with his 2018 Macbook Pro's keyboard and is awaiting reviews of the impending Dell XPS 15 before jumping ship so I'm not a fanboy, but next time you're out and about, look at the tablets and smart watches people are using and see for yourself.
I have a feeling this is pichai's fault, after he joined googles hardware got a lot more expensive and the nexus line was killed. Rather than getting market share with inexpensive hardware he wants to make a profit on it. Last edited by peachpuff on Fri Jun 21, 2019 7:05 am
I completely agree with the article, who in their right mind will pay $600 bucks for a celeron processor tablet when you can pretty much buy a ipad pro with high end performance and guarantee OS upgrades for at least four years.
A tone deaf delivery, everyone will agree, but that stand is completely optional. Last edited by RockDaMan on Fri Jun 21, 2019 7:27 am
I think the shareholders look at what Satya and Cook are able to do and justifiably demand a profit as well.
ChromeOS also has official support for Linux applications (albeit without 3D acceleration) now, across a solid cross-section of hardware. No need to fuss around with developer mode, it all just works out of the box via Linux containers. It's great for experimentation because if you mess up a container, you just spin up a new one. Having a cheap, low-maintenance, near-disposable PC that runs ChromeOS, Android and Linux is actually not bad at all. Just make sure it's a model with a touchscreen, or you'll invariably find yourself screaming at Android apps that don't respond to a mouse as you would expect.
The original Nexus 7 was good. The 2013 Nexus 7 was probably the best android tablet that's ever been released. If they would put out a $300 pixel tablet that came with innards similar to the pixel 3a but with an LCD screen I'd buy it in a second. I'm not sure why they have avoided something like that for so long. It's not like they're stepping on a bunch of feet from their OEMs, there's basically no significant android tablet market right now.
Sigh. Google really doesn't get it that stability matters. I own an iPad pro 9.7, which came out in March 2016. It's now June 2019. Will I get the upcoming IOS update with the new iPad-specific features? Of course I will - it's a silly question. Buying Apple means knowing that you'll have upgrades for a long time. I can't even recall my iPad 2 was supported. What will Apple's messaging/chat solution be two years from now? And how certain are you of your answer? I'd say, 'iMessage', and 'very'. Care to try the same for Google? How about video chat? Will it be Hangouts? Duo? How about music? Contrasting my iPad experience with the succession of Android phones I have owned is night-and-day. Even my Nexus 5 was problematic. Apple products have as many issues as anyone else's - expanding batteries, failing keyboards, software bugs & bloat,etc., but they generally at least try to make it right and don't leave existing owners high-and-dry if they don't replace their device every other year. edited: fixed typo from 'iPad 9.6' to 'iPad 9.7' Last edited by jhodge on Fri Jun 21, 2019 7:22 am

Create a tablet with the same issues and a hybrid laptop OS nobody wanted in a tablet and charge you twice as much.
Chicken and egg. The dearth of hardware has meant a limited market and thus, limited developer effort towards making great apps.
Stunning, given the sales the ipad is generating. That's equivalent to a sports team being so intimidated that they won't come out of the locker room and actually play against their opponents.
You can't complain about developer effort when Google themselves can't be arsed to make apps that are optimised for tablets.
If the market share is there, independent devs don't really need Google's lead in order to make compelling apps.
TL;DR: Frequent cancellations diminish trust. Google giving up on a project? Say it isn't so. /s Instead of starting and cancelling so many projects perhaps it would be better to invest time and effort researching projects to assess viability before starting them. I'm sure Google has nearly unlimited funds to make as many failures as it likes but ultimately this does not inspire confidence in would be end users. I certainly won't waste my time with Stadia for example. Why bother when there's a good chance the whole thing will be shuttered a year or so down the line. As for their business offerings I definitely would not risk it without service guarantees and even then I'd be looking for more reliable partners. In short, if you treat your business like a sandbox don't expect adults to come and play.
Probably because the prices have gotten more reasonable. I've seen the regular size version go on sale for under $350 fairly often. At that price I've considered getting one in spite of it being apple kit.
I like my pixel c a LOT Only problem I have is it won't let me apply the 8.1 patch Otherwise I can't fault it.
There's also the fact there's no money to be made in writing apps for Android tablets, at least compared to iPads. Android users don't pay for apps at even remotely the same level that they do iOS and money matters. I've owned my first iOS device only since February and spent more money on apps, and more useful of apps, than I did in 8 years of Android. Admittedly, some of paying was in order to get apps that could replicate the behavior of similar Android apps that used file system access for organization. (Comic book readers that could crawl folders, etc.)
It's people like you who don't understand basic economics. The monitor itself is very, very expensive to make. It's not easy making a monitor of that caliber, and others sell for 20K+. The stand is literally priced that way so Apple can recoup lost margin on the monitor. If you don't like it, don't buy it... I doubt you were gonna buy a 5k$ monitor to begin with anyways.

I don't use it for much, but it's still a joy to use when I do (simple web browsing, email, e-reader, a few low-key mobile games). Why they've never been able to duplicate this thing is beyond me. And for those complaining about Google not optimizing apps for tablets, many modern smartphones are approaching the size of the Nexus 7's screen. There's no need to optimize when the screen isn't that big to begin with.

Right now Pixel and Chromebook are the only two pieces of hardware they really need to just put their talent behind as far as updating and improving. I don't know what Stadia is gonna be like, but I won't be touching it until it's free.
That prompts the thought that Apple's taking their own CPU development in-house is paying off in a big way for them. They can offer an $800 tablet that kicks the shit out of the Intel-chip offering, while still maintaining their crazy margins, simply by being able to move enough volume to make custom chip fabrication worthwhile. It also shows, I suspect, how Intel is stagnating, just failing to compete successfully on multiple fronts simultaneously. They had a big push toward low-power devices, but despite claiming that competing against ARM would be a major focus of the company, AFAIK none of their low-power chips have ever been all that great. I don't own an iPad, but I've gathered that their CPUs are quite impressive, particularly when you consider the limited heat dissipation available in a tablet. Part of Google's suffering is that Apple is executing really well in terms of their supply chain. I often dislike the products they choose to actually make, as they've clearly decided that they have no interest in serving my particular computing needs, but I'm forced to acknowledge that what they build is fabricated at a level nobody else is very close to.

They don't have a good track record for making sensible cases. The reality is, that Trump's appointee have actually managed to upset more than a few judges with arguments that they perceive as insults to intelligence. There recent reattempts to take blankets, soap and toothbrushes away from children held at the border supremely upset those judges. They seemed tired trying to explain how basic logic works.
In related news, the EPA has changed its name to CPA, the Corporation Protection Agency, since it more closely mirrors its actions. ;-)

For Republicans, “good faith” means being a Christian, hating your non-White neighbors, and obeying your corporations (in the reverse order of importance).   That’s not very Orwellian. The name is just fine as it is!
lp0 on fire
The effect that Trump and his enablers have on our environment may be the most damaging of all that they 'accomplish'.
Somewhere that isn't impacted -- or they will when they cash those big corporate-shill paychecks. At least that's what they've convinced themselves will happen.
Totally unlike, say, requiring electricity producers to meet more stringent emissions standards that might reduce the ghastly respiration-related illness and death from burning coal Trump administration finalizes replacement for Obama’s Clean Power Plan. This administration is nothing if not consistent. But look, this whole thing is (apparently) about good faith. So here's a modest proposal, to mollify the safety conscious at NHTSA and EPA: for every <unit> of fuel efficiency increase that results in 20% more driving we, the US House of Representatives, will increase Federal Fuel tax a penny-for-penny amount, to insure the more efficient vehicles do not tempt their owners to drive additional miles. Everyone will be safer, and everyone will have a share. Now certainly, there might be some push-pack on such a tax from the US Senate, and of course it would have to be signed by the President. But we're patient, and in good faith we can wait and -- in the meantime -- confirm our good faith with the state of California by continuing to affirm their right to self-determination on air-quality matters. Having recently lived there, I'd say the majority -- not all but a majority -- of Californians really would pay more for cleaner, more efficient cars. Maybe even their SUVs and light trucks. Who knows? Its a bizarre place.
So... people would like to drive more miles if only their vehicles were efficient enough, and the Trump administration is saying they are protecting us from that impulse?
Wehrum demurred, asserting only that he would ""do what the president says."" Sounds like a dictatorship!
What's that New Yorker cartoon about? ""yes the planet got destroyed, but for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders"" I'd link it but too lazy, or tipsy, to care. Great New Yorker cartoon. - made it's point and stuck with me, kinda raw truth
This is an age old schtick, I remember hearing the ""if we make them cleaner you'll die!"" canard at least as long ago as the 00s when the Bush Administration went legal loggerheads against California the first time and I bet if I researched I'd find it was even older than that.🙄😒
Oh, they sleep at night just fine, on 1000 point Egyptian cotton sheets in a huge mansion in a gated community.
Responding to Trump’s PR monkeys is a waste of time, so just to point out how to clean up transportation and improve regional air quality: 1) Diesel is the worst offender, in terms of particulates and NOx, so make it a priority to convert all trucking to electric; 2) Gasoline is the next worst offender, mostly in O3 ozone in modern engines, although it’s still fossil carbon, so make it the next priority to convert all passenger vehicle to electric; 3) Shipping is the dirtiest of all, sulfur-laden bunker fuel, and electric won’t really cut it, so work towards synthetic photosynthetic fuels for shipping and also for . . . 4) air traffic. There, problem solved, just need to build out renewables, wake me when it’s done. . .
Hope you have a good cryonics plan.
However comical the reasoning and platitudes may be, with the accelerating deployment of hybrid and all-electric cars, I suspect this entire argument is going to be moot in ten years. It's going to play hell with the intent of the CAFE standards at first.
Not to worry, they are planning to replace them with COVFEFE standards.
The automakers are siding with CARB because they know CA has a stronger hand to play here. CA cannot accept our standards being rolled back - they have been too beneficial to air quality and our overall economy. If the Feds prevail and CA loses its waiver, the state will ban the sale of ICE vehicles. If we can't regulate mileage standards, we'll eliminate the problem entirely. We can't ban them overnight, but we can set the date. And, as the state has done with the LCFS we have a ton of other levers that the feds can't block to achieve the goals of the state. CAs CARB standards at least allow automakers to keep selling ICE vehicles and hybrids, and the automakers are simply trying to preserve that.
Actually 2-stroke engines are the worst offender. Lawn equipment should be first on the block. It's generally non-critical and there are adequate (if sometimes inconvenient) alternatives. That should be 0) on your list.
I think this is true. But Californians have been trained to look at total cost, or at least, to trust that it'll come together as an investment. All of the energy efficiency in the state and such came about with very few taxpayer dollars, and despite having the 3rd highest electricity rates in the country, California has among the lowest bills. That is, the conservation paid for itself. And I think we have an attitude that something similar will happen with autos. Cheaper fuel prices with BEVs, less maintenance, etc. And if we get QOL benefits from less noise pollution, better air quality, etc. then I think we'll generally go for it.
The job of the EPA is literally to force companies to do things consumers may not want for the sake of our environment.
The Trump administration is so full of s### that the best use for them would be as fertilizer. All the things they say to justify this rollback, about how the tech is impossible or the cars too dangerous, are neither. Entered into evidence as exhibit A: the 2020 Corolla Hybrid, which has a combined rating of 52 MPG. No crash ratings yet, but when was the last time a Corolla had bad crash ratings? Entered into evidence as exhibit B: the 2019 Honda Accord hybrid rated at 48MPG for both city and highway. 5 star NHTSA crash ratings. Not going to enter any electrics into evidence because those are changing so fast I don't think one from today will hold a candle to one built 5 years from now. My point being that one does not even need to go into cars that look like hybrids to obtain very high MPG. Neither of the cars above are rolling death traps. What they are though are much better cars than any of the American manufacturers can produce. Also, if the Trump administration really cared about safety they would work to remove from the market the larger trucks, SUVs and vans that people are driving . Those are relatively safe for the occupants but demonstrably unsafe for the pedestrians and occupants of the cars they plow into. Which vehicle would you rather be in an accident with - a Corolla or an Escalade? Exactly.

I heard higher fuel-economy standards also cause autism...
Same letters, but Enterprise Protection Agency. I have been calling it that since Scott Pruitt was its head and I'm sure that so does the GOP.
Their argument is not that new cars are more dangerous. The argument is that new cars will be more expensive, therefore people will delay buying new cars. This will result in them driving older, more dangerous cars longer. There are a lot of things wrong with this argument (e.g. the values assigned to rebound mentioned in the article), but citing the safety of new cars is not relevant. The working assumption is that all new cars are going to be safer than old cars because the safety requirements are higher.
Except their argument is that new, more efficient cars are more dangerous. They contend that people with more efficient vehicles will drive more, and therefore get into more accidents.
CO2 emissions and fuel economy are the same thing. It's a simple ""multiply by this conversion factor"", determined by the composition of the fuel of choice, to convert from one to the other. Meeting the planned new CAFE standards is not difficult. You slap a 48V mild hybrid system on any new model that weighs over 2 tons or costs over $35k. You release one or two midsize to large crossover/SUV models that are PHEV with maybe 30 miles EV range. If you make trucks, you make one of the 7 powertrain choices a PHEV. You leave everything else untouched. Cars don't have to shrink. The carmakers all agreed to this. None of them wanted to risk being the only one to do it, but they all said that if they weren't going to be undercut by someone else skirting the rules, they could all achieve 54.5 CAFE with current technology. Hell, they could all easily do a lot better than that with current technology if they weren't so worried about making pickup trucks continue to grow by 12% every generation and would put the same effort into their smaller vehicles. Taxing fuel at a high rate would have a similar overall effect; the trick is figuring out a way to do so without heavily penalizing the poorest workers who can least afford it. Building efficiency into a new-vehicle standard puts the capital cost on the shoulders of those who can most easily bear it, and the effects benefit everyone through the vehicle's entire life.
Negotiating in good faith with the Trump administration? It's like asking to be stabbed in the back.
> ""causing the number of road fatalities to increase."" They pretend to care about this, right after forcing the EPA to cause 1,400 deaths per year from the Affordable Clean Energy rule. We've always been at war with Eastasia.
A little bit lower than that.
Didn’t do so well in physics I take it. A barrier is like an infinitely large car. What matters is the closing speed. A barrier is the equivalent of a head on collision with the same size car with 2x the closing speed.

Yes. Thanks much.
Customers in the Applecare Enterprise program can reach out to their representative and submit a list of devices to find out if any of them are affected rather than enter in each serial number one at a time. In whatever management software you have you can filter out the devices by using the model identifier ""15-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Mid 2015)""
Wait, so, users will be without their laptops, which some/many of which use as their primary work machine, for days while Apple replaces the battery? Oh boy! Can't wait!
Oh damn I’m on the lookout for a 2015 15” model with GPU for my new job. They’re last laptops Apple made with a useable keyboard. Last edited by redtomato on Thu Jun 20, 2019 6:44 pm
Apple's approach to support is sort of curious: it's head and shoulders above your standard consumer-laptop-warranty horror stories; with the added perk of fairly widely distributed retail support locations; but that's where it begins and ends. Dell and their ilk; by contrast, will do pretty much anything from ""haha, maybe the geek squad will care/4 week depot repairs after jerking you around"" to ""tech onsite next business day; unless you'd prefer to just swap the part yourself, in which case we'll overnight it to you."" (anything faster than that seems to be reserved for expensive network gear and maybe the fancier servers). I'm always a bit surprised that, at least within a certain vicinity of Apple stores or logistical facilities they don't even offer a higher tier of hardware support. Just not interested? No hardware with field replaceable units left so it's moot?
bonus, they also have all the dongles built right into them. (a top end mid 2014 would be a comparable machine too)
So, pre-modern laptops must have suffered from chronic dongle-cryptorchidism...
Er, no. Apple supplied them to retail and EOL'd this model in Feb 2017. However that doesn't mean a consumer is safe because they purchased a laptop in April 2017, as stores don't go throw the old model in the shredder the day it stops being made, plus there's refurbs and the second hand market. Most likely it was sold then, but there's exceptions.
Huh, my current laptop is a Mid-2015, and its battery has swollen twice over the years (according to one Genius Bar employee it may have something to do with my usage pattern — the laptop is plugged in almost all the time). The battery was replaced free of charge both times, but it sure was inconvenient to part with my main laptop for a week at a time. (Last time it happened, I had to purchase a “loaner” and returned that when the original came back from repair.)
Agreed. Most of the time, far superior if you live within a modest driving range of one of their stores. Didn't they do some kind of ""you wait for your battery replacement"" when they had to do the iPhone battery replacement program? Why can't they offer that for customers as well? I mean, I'm fine ALSO offering this kind of depot level send it off to get it fixed, but I bet the vast majority of folks would be happy to drop it off at an Apple store by X time, and pick it back up within Y hours. Or if it's near the end of the day, within Z time after the opening of the store.
On this model, the battery is glued and soldered to the motherboard, so I think their normal process is just to swap out the whole motherboard/keyboard assembly for a new one rather than scrape off your old battery and reassemble it. It's annoying that they have to ship the machine out for it rather than say allowing you to make an appointment and have it done locally same day with the parts shipped in.
It is not soldered or glued to the motherboard, but it is glued to the top case. They actually replace the entire top case assembly, although presumably (hopefully?) they will swap over the existing SSD since that's still a separate module on these models. Although I would be careful to have a current backup (and have FileVault turned on, of course) for any machine sent in since who knows whether they'll actually return your original drive.
I too hate the new keyboards, but interestingly the keyboards in the 2019 models have rectified a lot of my gripes with them. They still have a lot less key travel than I’d like, but they’re definitely a lot less clicky than previous models. They have that softer key press that I really liked in the 2015 era keyboards. Also the Touch Bar I thought I’d hate, but now that there’s enough apps and IDEs supporting it it’s definitely grown on me. Still miss that hardware escape key, but I’ve remapped caps lock to escape to fix that. Might be worth giving them a try if you’re near an Apple Store.
This should be interesting, as my employers (a primarily-NZ based company with several thousand employees world wide) solely use Macbook Pros for the development team (.Net Core) - we probably have a few hundred floating around, and they are mostly (like 95%+) 2015 model 15"" ones (only recently have devs started getting newer models, as the bulk buy of stock units are diminished through the companies expansion). So yeah, as Apple are also stating a 1-2 week turnaround on fixes for affected units, this should get interesting.
I find the new oversized trackpad to be a far bigger issue than the new keyboard.
If they have hundreds I’m betting they will not be using a retail program. Enterprise is handled differently.
Why would you believe this?
Apple support is also usuriously expensive. I have next day on site for my work Dells for less than Apple Care (basic, not plus) on comparable machines. Not to mention the fact the Dells' batteries and keyboards don't fail.
A computer whose battery swells when plugged in continuously is a defective design. It's not ""your usage patterns,"" it's their shit design.
My work and home MacBooks are permanently plugged in and haven't gotten swollen batteries, so at least anecdotally this hasn't happened to me. Is this a problem that has affected a significant number of people? Who makes their batteries anyway - is in-house? I would think it was a more a problem with the battery design than the laptop design.
What a waste to glue the battery to the top case, this is the same problem I have with the new keyboard design. It's not that they fail, that can happen to any product, it's that if they fail it's like Apple went out of their way to make it hard to replace. Having to send your laptop away for a week is a pretty good reason to want a removable SSD. Back ups or not, I'd much rather not have to send my system drive in if I don't have to.
The Genius Bar employee pointed out that my battery cycle count was unusually low despite the machine being on 24/7 since purchase, so I suppose it likely exacerbated whatever heat or other issues that was already there, and most people with more on-the-go usage patterns may have a better experience. Apparently I’m not happy with the issue, but knowing what might have made it worse gives me a certain amount of control.
I'm really surprised this isn't getting more play. It's absolutely ridiculous it's a one to two week turnaround! I can't be without my laptop that long. A couple hours, I understand. But not two freaking weeks.
Other companies make laptops too.
Oh boy...our friend who handles a lot of the battery sourcing for Apple is probably going to have his hands full--unless he's only dealing with the phone--in which case he's already been here and done it and can advise the other people that will be handling this mess. Upside is that if the wife is going to need something, she won't be waiting 2 weeks.
Yes they do, but sometimes people have tried the alternatives and found them wanting. Im not an Apple fanboy, nor am I a Microsoft hater (far from it, I make my money from .Net Core and related stuff), but I simply don't like Windows - even with WSL. It just feels ... wrong and I feel out of place on it. Similarly Im not a Linux (or BSD) hater - I use it all over the place as a server, but I have never in the 25 years of trying got on with X11 or any Linux GUI system. Again, they feel wrong and I feel out of place using them. OSX however is home to me, and Im guessing a lot of other people feel the same way - Apples hardware sure has gotten questionable over the years, and OSX isn't progressing as quickly as it used to between major versions, but OSX is still where I feel at home and at my most productive. I'm not a user because I'm locked in or held hostage, I'm a user because I like it better than the alternatives. I'm just lucky to have found a job which allows me to stay on it at work as well So yeah, there are other manufacturers out there, but only one does OSX. And for lot of us, OSX is what we like.
When you're trying to source a nearly five year old laptop simply because the keyboard doesn't suck as much as the current ones it's time to break free of the Apple shackles.

Does there always have to be some nefarious reason someone likes something?
I had to get the battery replaced in my 2015 13"" MBP recently - so not in the category of laptops affected by this issue - and they couldn't guarantee less than a 3 business day turnaround. Plus I had to sign a waiver acknowledging that there may be data loss, ie. I might not get my original SSD back. And I had to pay $290 for the pleasure. I ended up dropping it off on a Friday afternoon and picking it up on the Tuesday afternoon, and got my original SSD back. Still, it was a stressful few days.
How can you be so sure that it’s defective “design”? Considering that such issues are not widely reported, defective manufacturing (e.g., battery pack not working within the specced heat envelope) is at least as plausible of a cause.
As a neutral, I'm happy that Apple fans can no longer mock Samsung with a straight face.
Most professionals wouldn't want to replace a component in their computer, even if you sent Linus to their workplace to explain the process.
Lack of familiarity with high-end Dell laptops, I would assume.
What do you mean “no longer”? It’s hardly the first device to be recalled for out-of-warranty repairs because of batteries issues. Hell, it’s not even the first time Apple does this. None have been as bad as the explosion epidemic of the Note 7 though.
Eeeeh the bias https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-offe ... 546.0.html
""But Macs are immune to viruses!!!"" I still hear this all the time. And, as this is Ars, yes, I am perfectly aware there are differences between a hack, a bug, and a virus, etc - that matters to you and me, but the average Mac user probably doesnt know or understand the difference. And a lot of them still think they are immune to anything bad happening to their Mac that doesnt involve dropping it or spilling a cup of coffee on it. So, thanks for the PSA.
This exploit soon coming to ad networks near you. At least the phishing attack is easy to avoid. When a legit site tries to hack your browser, that's much more serious of a threat.
But on that same note. Those people probably won't use anything but Safari.
""I do not have direct evidence [Windows users] were targeted as a result of this exploit,"" Probably because the exploit fails on Windows, installation/execution - even with security escalation to the equivalent of root and above (TrustedInstaller) doesn't bypass malware/security screening. The Firefox hole could have been used on Windows, but if the payload included known malware or anything suspicious, it could not bypass the integrated or 3rd party malware tools, (assuming they are using the proper Windows malware APIs for screening.)
""Interestingly, a researcher at Google's Project Zero had privately reported the code-execution flaw to Mozilla in mid April."" 2+ months for a fix doe not make the red panda developers look adorable. Their mascot still is.
No need to believe: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/701/ You can see a comparison chart at 09:46. Catalina (10.15) will scan all software for malicious content, quarantined or not.
Reads headline. Clinks link, and scrolls down to the comments section expecting an OS nerd fight. Leaves entirely satisfied.
No opinion, but they have 90 days to fix until outed by Project Zero right?
Yes. We have no way to know how complicated this was to fix (and test properly). Two months may sound like a long time but isn't necessarily.
I have no dog in this fight. I am curious to see if the exploit for FF is public on day 91. They do not have resources of MS and MS patch is still not out? FF patched, or so they thought, before day 90. Maybe some credit is due? Or not, I can't judge, but they did issue patches before 90 days. Whether 90 days is fair, the system is another matter that I am not qualified to think about right now
I agree. I am still on the fence about MS being outed on day 91.The problem is, I cannot judge how serious the flaw is, on the other hand, huge gaping security holes that were known in house, or ignored after being privately pointed out, weren't patched until they were publicly outed. So, I do get the 90 day deadline, ( that, ironically Google doesn't abide by) Edited because drunk and smart phone are antithetical
I wonder what the Venn diagram would look like examining ""Owns a Mac computer"" and ""Uses cryptocurrency""? And how different would it be vs Windows users. I know the sample sizes would be vastly different, but still it would be an interesting factoid.
So you're saying they should just block all third party apps then?
Just the gigantic wooden ones.
""Owns a Mac computer"" and ""Works for Coinbase"" was the only Venn diagram these people were interested in. It was a very targeted attack, using a valuable zero-day exploit, so I suspect that they were after a much bigger payday than just a few random wallets.
If the figures I’ve seen quoted are accurate, an exploit which gives you remote code execution in a modern browser is worth six figures. If you can get that much simply by selling it, you’re definitely after a big payday taking a chance on something like this since even a successful attack is going to be noticed as soon as money starts moving.
That’s 100% NOT true. Gatekeeper is set to allow installation of Apps from the App Store AND trusted developers (I.e. Applications available outside the App Store with a valid code signature). To run an unsigned app DOES NOT require a you to enter a CLI cmd, simply right-click (or two-finger click) and choose “Open,” and you’re good to go. Please stop spreading FUD.
I understand how you really need to feel superior to Mac users, but you should perhaps try to talk to some of them. You might find that most software developers use Macs, perhaps because OSX is much closer to UNIX/Linux than Windows, but I am sure some of them understand malware threats at least as well as you do, and I would surmise that they may actually be more technically cogent than you are. At least I have never seen them cast judgement on a user just because of his or her choice of OS. Of course it could be just that they are not as smart as you are. But I don't think so.
No. https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019 According to the stackoverflow survey, the most popular primary operating system is Windows, and the most popular platform to develop for is Linux.
I think you guys are missing the bigger picture here. The 0-day exploit reported back in April, found a vulnerability in Array.pop. But the same reporter of that bug noted that the Firefox sandbox protected against the exploit. So Mozilla probably decided that while important to fix, it wasn't time critical. This was until an attacker found the other 0-day exploit, allowing them to break out of the sandbox. And this was reported by Coinbase this week (or last week?). And then Mozilla raised the priority to time critical, and began releasing patches within days. Furthermore, since the April-reported exploit was under wraps, how did an attacker manage to get hold of both exploits within the time frame? Hence some are suspecting that someone, who had access to the internal bug report, used it or sold it to the attackers. It is - of course - also plausible that the attackers simply stumbled upon both exploits themselves, but it seems a little unlikely.
Lol. Semantics. You're basically identifying why he believes.
This is much more likely than you might think. Black hats and white hats are both looking for the same bugs, only black hats are arguably better funded. It isn't very surprising that white hats would find a bug black hats had been sitting on until they could use it for maximum gain. And as you note, security researchers were only aware of one of the two exploits until after it was used. So sure, one of the white hats could have sold out. But on the other hand these 0-day security vulnerabilities are restricted to a relative handful of people who have something to lose if they're discovered to be malicious.
Or it could be a macOS executable that just doesn't run on Windows.
They do unless you disable the security protocol to allow apps downloaded from anywhere. Don't think that you can get Firefox from Apple's App Store as they want you to use Safari. So an element of 'at your own risk' if you disable the security to use alternative browsers etc.
Fedora took way too long to provide this critical security update, I didn't receive 67.0.3 until today (on Fedora 29).
Note to editors - I don't think this article was up to the usual Ars standards, in three cases. Netwire is thrown out like it's as common as MS office. I'm an experienced Mac user and thought it sounded familiar but had to look it up to find out that it is a remote access tool/trojan. Then it mentions ""two relatively primitive methods to maintain persistence"" without saying what they are. I presume one has to do with login items preference, as the figure shows, but the figure lacks any caption or context. SB
Firefox's update mechanism continues to frustrate me... You would think that if there's a zero-day exploit, they would show some kind of pop-up that you need to restart the browser to install a critical update. Today is Friday. The patch was released on Tuesday. Guess what? No notification! I had to go to ""Firefox"" > ""About Firefox"" to see that there's an update pending. This goes back ages ago, when on Windows machines I had to go to ""Help"" > ""About"" for it to notice there's an update, then to click Update, then to install. So much for the automated update service running in the background. Chrome, OTOH, just silently installs itself, you don't even know when.
Firefox does update itself, but only when you restart it. If you keep the browser open for long periods of time it doesn't. Eventually there are notifications if you don't.
If you're installed any Firefox after build 50ish? It does the Auto-update in the background like Chrome. But like Chrome you have to close the program to update.
Nope, was only responding to the guy that made odd statements about mac users. This was a targeted exploit against a specific target. My guess is if that target was suspected of running windows boxes, they would have exploited Firefox on Windows, if they were running Linux, they would have exploited Firefox on Linux. But hey, at least the OP was modded into oblivion.
I wonder how much of that is by choice, though? Of the three companies I've worked for as a professional software engineer only one offers/allows their software engineers Macs. Most companies give you a crappy 'enterprise' Windows laptop that you're then stuck trying to run Linux in VirtualBox as your only option to actually do any work (which, then you also get the joy of managing a Linux install! fun!). At this point for me, using a Mac is a hard requirement for any prospective employer.
All things considered I guess you are not that big loss...
Er, so I check if my ancient ass iMac circa 2006 is infected how exactly???
FWIW, 67.0.3 (June 18) is still behind the latest, 67.0.4, which Mozilla released yesterday (June 20), patching another vulnerability reported by Coinbase (this time rated High, not Critical).
Lawyers will use this to sue Tesla. Autopilot name needs to be changed before more people die from overestimating the capabilities.
duh.com
That's what I thought would happen years ago when I first heard about the Autopilot name and yet here we are with Tesla still misleading potential customers and getting away with it. Last edited by infidel castro on Thu Jun 20, 2019 4:37 pm
Doesn't help that Tesla has a tablet right there that you can play games with.
Good. This shit is ridiculous, and Tesla needs to be made to bleed for its* stubbornness and ignorant pride. *Pretty sure its Elon.
""Close to half (44%) of respondents who were asked about Autopilot reported that they had heard of it, followed by Driving Assistant Plus (19%), ProPilot Assist (15%), Traffic Jam Assist (11%), and Super Cruise (10%)."" It might be interesting to see the numbers from the people who have ever heard of the thing they are commenting on.
Games are completely off-limits unless car is in park.
The survey is useless (for measuring public danger) if it is surveying random people in the population, their knowledge has no impact on how the cars operate. It would be useful to find out the ratio of actual Tesla owners who don't understand its limits.
Yeah, I'm actually more surprised that they haven't already been sued in a class-action suit over the name giving people an inflated sense of its abilities. In any company with a legal department that had any teeth, the name would have never made it past the first review. And if the counter-argument is that airplane pilots know what the term means, then Tesla owners should have to go through the same training levels to be able to operate their car that pilots do. That's a massive apples to oranges comparison going on there.
do you know what advertising is
What I infer from each of these different technologies is that one word can make all the difference in determining what a driver might think is safe to do while using them. That was is assist (or assistance). Now, this most likely falls under   for users here. Now with no evidence to back this up, it seems Tesla's use of the term autopilot was an attempt at marketing to bring about feeling or superiority over it's competitors' technologies, but in doing so they very well could've neglected to put themselves in their customer's shoes and think about what their drivers might think they could get away with in 'autopilot'. And yes, this sounds a lot like many of the points in the article, but I wanted to put it in a way I understand it, despite the wonderful job Mr. Lee did (no sarcasm to be meant here btw.) Last edited by andrewb610 on Thu Jun 20, 2019 4:39 pm
Most of the public doesn't understand how autopilot in an airplane works. Once you drive/own either an airplane or car, you should understand the limits.
Minor quibble but shouldn't it just be ADAS without system? The ""S"" in ADAS is system. I wouldn't refer to NES as Nintendo Entertainment System system.
A follow up to my original post sorta, but I gotta wonder, does Tesla's legal department talk to their marketing department, because I feel the lawyers might have had some input on what kind of legal exposure they could be open to by using the term 'autopilot' even with:   Edited for spacing and clarity.

So people can play games on it whilst racing through a park?!? /s Whilst I'm a firm proponent of actual physical buttons (I think my '97 Volvo is ergonomically superior to any modern car I have driven, apart from the hazard warning light button), I'm sick of people lambasting Tesla for the screen. Car manufacturers have been sliding towards hiding controls on shitty small touchscreens for years now, at least Tesla uses a large and decent quality touchpanel.
Tesla should re-brand it to Co-Pilot. They can re-brand or reintroduce Autopilot at later date when their self driving tech gets even better.
Even people who know better overestimate it. There are endless posts on Tesla forums about how to defeat the hands-on-wheel detection.
That battle was lost decades ago when ATM machines came out. Automated Teller Machine machines.
I hate that silly counter argument. You aren't going to drive off the road if your plane is on autopilot, or end up in the ditch or hit a tree. For the most part you won't hit anything in a plane on autopilot...You can afford to not look at the sky for a few minutes at a time.
Even if you were to ask pilots, there won't be a single definition of what an autopilot can or can't do. Some of them will be used to systems that aren't much more sophisticated than what Lawrence Sperry demonstrated more than a century ago, while others will have worked with autopilots that could perform an entire flight if they were allowed to, including capabilities like terrain avoidance.

Into which we input our PIN numbers.
Pilots do not have to keep their hands on the controls when autopilot is engaged. In fact, moving the stick/yoke will disconnect autopilot.
Ok, just wait one second... It's not okay to take your hands off the steering wheel while under an ""autopilot""? I thought that was the whole point? If I keep my hands on the wheel, can't I inadvertently mess up what the autopilot system is trying to do to keep me safe? Secondly, why would a person (who doesn't own a Tesla) think it's not okay, simply based on a name? Pilots, mind you, are the notion this is based on, right? Pilots are not required to keep hands/feet on controls during flight or auto-flight. They simply must maintain control of the aircraft. (There is nothing in FARs regulations that state they specifically have to.) During auto-landing flight below 2500ft, pilots are instructed to keep their hands in a ""guarding position"". But this doesn't necessarily mean holding onto the controls. It's absolutely reasonable to think that by engaging any ""auto-steering"" mechanism, one is able to remove their hands from the wheel of the car.
Tesla fanboys keep insisting to me, at length, that this is not a goddamn factor, so I'm delighted to have something to shut them up with.
Something named ""Auto Pilot"" sold to people who predominately don't work in the aviation sector makes said individuals prone to thinking the system will handle all aspects of piloting the vehicle? SHOCKING!!!
The irritating thing about hands-on-wheel detection is that it nags you when your hands ARE on the wheel. What it is detecting is resistance - you have to tug on the wheel to satisfy it, when you otherwise would not do so. An eyes-on-road system would likely be safer and less annoying.
This survey doesn't seem very helpful considering that most were likely not owners of the respective products. What would be more interesting is a survey of owners of those products and quizzing them on capabilities.
I mean, none of your conclusions here fail to logically follow from how Autopilot was designed, sold, and generally understood to operate. But shit in, shit out, no offense to you. There shouldn't BE an auto-steering system, it shouldn't be sold as or represented as ""Autopilot"" or ""full self-driving,"" and nobody should have been led to believe that taking their hands off the wheel at any time was safe or reasonable. Unless the system is fully autonomous, driver assistance systems should be predicated on full human driver involvement at all times, with the system serving as a watchful guardian against unforced errors and moments of distraction. It should step in when you fail, not wait for you to step in when it fails. But the human and their judgment should remain in the driver seat. This is how envelope protections on an Airbus airliner work - they just make sure you don't do anything stupid. Last edited by Snark218 on Thu Jun 20, 2019 4:54 pm
I suspect it’s less the Autopilot name than the “full self-driving” that Tesla keeps trying to sell, even though it’s not ready. It’s quite understandable that people would confuse the thing Tesla is actually shipping with the vaporware they’re selling. Last edited by numerobis on Thu Jun 20, 2019 4:53 pm
In order to get cash money.
Brand names are to generate interest and excitement in something. The term Autopilot does this in spades. When you use a Tesla, your reminded over and over again, both when you turn on the functionality, and when you start using it, and intermittently while you're using it, that you need to keep your hands on the wheel. No one is going to be able to sue Tesla and win just because the brand name is misleading. It's just not the case that a reasonable person using a Tesla will come away thinking they're free to stop paying attention to driving.
Respectfully, you’re showing your ignorance of what is involved in flying an airplane safely. Under visual flight rules, it is up to the pilot to look outside to see and avoid traffic. In all cases it’s the pilot’s responsibility to maintain control of the aircraft.
The comments section on this one is going to get ugly.
Given the general public themselves don't know what ""autopilot"" means, how can the vendors make claims of capabilities? Autopilot depends on the make and model of the aircraft and flight system. It does not automatically fly the plane. So-- i.e. ""the pilot"" -- has to program it dynamically. It's not a hands-off process. Basic A/P is simply hold a heading and MAYBE an altitude. Only more complex aircraft with autothrottles get close to the perceived capabilities of autopilot. In almost all cases, the human has to manually specify airspeed.
Yes and no. Regardless, you'd probably be surprised. Speaking from personal experience, the only reason I, (and presumably someone else) are still here is because I'm less a proponent of ""The Big Sky Theory"" than the guy (probably a doctor ) in a Bonanza who was head down and not looking out the window while VFR over the middle of nowhere. But yes, in general there is less to run into up there. Last edited by Raptor on Thu Jun 20, 2019 5:05 pm
I think my favorite thing about living in the Mirror Universe is that Jags and Volvos are cool again.
That TWR car reminds me of the Silk Cut Jaguars that won at La Mans
You mean the Silk Cut Jaguars that won Le Mans fielded by... Tom Walkinshaw Racing? (The team is Techeetah, but I'm sure that having the TWR name and *those colours* is a masterstroke for PR)
I thought this was the Darkest Timeline...
Po-TAY-to, Po-TAH-to.
When were Jags ever not cool? Sure, a lot have been crap but I don't ever recall them not being cool.
They still are.
I sincerely hope, if he wins, Sellers is limited to being awarded an eTrophy only, any physical trophies would be a contradiction in terms. Last edited by buckyrealtoo on Fri Jun 21, 2019 3:22 am
The press embargo on the Polestar 1 first drives ended a few days ago. Was Ars in attendance?
Upon first glance, I thought you were referring to Mercedes.
A Jaaaaaaaag has always been cool.
Nope. We didn’t get an invite to see the Polestar 2 while it was doing the rounds either.
Anyone know why musk doesn't want tesla racing? Is it autopilot related?
Cool, as in Jack Sparrow cool. It's a lovable rogue in the first years. For several years after, everybody you know tells you to get rid of it but you've been through so much together you can't part with it. By the end, you'll leave your keys in the ignition to see if anyone takes it from your hands.
When they were owned by Ford (exhibit A: X-Type).
um there's a whole stack of comparative videos on youtube on the model 3 vs bmw M3 etc & drag racing & other models not to mention coverage on all ev's on other sites as well And articles all over the place https://electrek.co/2018/12/23/tesla-ro ... tric-race/ https://electrek.co/2018/07/03/tesla-mo ... ace-track/ https://insideevs.com/news/343861/watch ... ing-video/
My favorite comparison: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ib-02b2ooLY&t=207 I would guess that the reason Musk is not pursuig the track world is that Teslas aren't track cars. Even the Roadster is meant to be a daily driver. Targeting racing means stripping amenities and comfort. I bet Musk views that as a distraction.
Yeah Tesla's can be made ultra fast, as motors with instant huge torque allows. I asked because the article mentioned musk doesn't want tesla to race, when it's been a tool of the motor industry for decades.

Now if battery tech can shave a few thousand pounds off the weight and provide better power delivery and range. Eventually.
It’s probably more likely that Tesla will wait to unveil the roadster 2.0 and then proceed to lay down the smack Keep in mind that they have a point to prove and are looking at doing crazy stuff like adding cold thrusters on a already fast car
>>...who also consulted on historical accuracy.<< ....on how to be an evil shapeshifter??
I really liked the first season, although I didn't realize it was based on a Dan Simmons novel - which I'll now have to read. I hope the upcoming season is as good. Sounds promising.
So, am I missing the tie-in with the name here? Season 1 was named ""The Terror"" after one of the ships in the show. What's named ""The Terror"" in Season 2?
The second season is simply named after the first, to indicate production heritage. There's no connection between the two seasons; it's an anthology series. I suspect season 1 was intended as a one-off; it's a complete story that doesn't lend itself to a sequel. But it was quite successful, an audience had been built, and ""The Terror"" is one of those names that lends itself to reuse, now with a subtitle. The title of Simmons' novel, I believe, is fairly typical Simmons wordplay; the story itself involves terrorizing events - at several different levels, from the supernatural to human foibles - and also happens to be the name of the ship. The novel, though fictional, is based on an actual expedition that played out much as depicted, sans supernatural elements, and the ship's names are the same as those in real life - which raises the question of who the hell thought it was a good idea to name ships Terror and Erebus - AND send them on the same mission together.
It's a good book, read it when it can out. Unrelated to story at hand but try Simmons's Drood. Well worth your time if you dig Dickens and Victorian gothic horror.
The evil shapeshifter is trump’s ghost from the future. 👻
Fun fact Takei played every role on Star Trek.
Not unlike giant enemy crabs.
Because its a horror anthology series not a docudrama series.
The show was a master class on how to use the medium to build on the reference material. On of my favorite things they did was how they leveraged the conceit of the ships having been grounded by ice to incorporate Dutch angles into the cinematography and set design.
Is this April Fools? Why would they do this to the original series? Jared Harris must be spinning on his iceberg after his corpse was floated out to sea.
Third season should be a retelling of the vampire myths in ancient Romania/Wallachia. Then it could be a docudramadracula.
On a more serious note, if any of you ever have the opportunity to go to an internment camp location, you should take it. I've been to the Heart Mountain camp between Cody and Powell, WY, and it's a very powerful experience. As a country, we've done a lot of pretty shitty things to our own citizens, but this ranks right up near the top.

My understanding is that there's not even really a production heritage. The cast is all new, but so is the crew and most of the production team. It's a ""second season"" in name only, basically a way to tie the different horror mini-series together under one brand. https://www.amc.com/shows/the-terror/ta ... r-season-2 https://www.thewrap.com/the-terror-seas ... rge-takei/ SixDegrees wrote: I suspect season 1 was intended as a one-off; it's a complete story that doesn't lend itself to a sequel.

Back when the ""second season"" was first announced, I noticed the irony between AMC making a totally different story/production part of the same ""series,"" while TNT had just produced the limited series ""The Alienist,"" and their creation of another season featuring the same cast based on the sequel book is called a ""sequel series,"" instead of a second season. SixDegrees wrote: The novel, though fictional, is based on an actual expedition that played out much as depicted, sans supernatural elements, and the ship's names are the same as those in real life... Well, there's a lot of gaps in what we know about that expedition. The novel and show stay true to what's known, or what was known at the time, while taking articstic license about what could have happened, even before introducing the supernatural. For example, the novel was written before the HMS Terror was discovered by modern archaeologists. Since it's now been discovered, the show altered its narrative accordingly.

While you're there, consider visiting Yasukuni shrine in Japan and listening to the ultranationalists shouting racist slogans about Americans and Chinese from loudspeakers mounted on fleets of black people-carriers. At least, if an American politician visits the camps in the US, they at least show the semblance of guilt. In Japan, the Prime Minister publicly celebrates the memories of convicted WW2 war criminals by visiting Yasukuni war shrine: - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controv ... uni_Shrine
Takei confirmed as actual zombie or vampire. Next time someone wants to inter one of those, I suggest fire or a stake through the heart first.
Ms. Ouellette, Although mr. Takei was in a despicable concentration camp, I doubt they buried him. You wanted “interned” I think.
Simmons has had his ups and downs since Hyperion, although he was pretty spectacular until then (Hyperion, Song of Kali, Prayer to Broken Stones, Carrion Comfort). Had a bit of a _really_ racist anti-Muslim breakdown on a blog post “The Time Traveller’s Tale”, all the more surprising for his very sympathetic Hyperion Palestinian Colonel character. Ilium was mediocre. Endymion best forgotten. Terror, a later book, sees him back in full form. Highly recommended.
I'm not sure if there's a subtext of implied racism in the internment, but from a cursory glance at Wikipedia, it wasn't just the Japanese who were interned.
It happened in Canada, as well. It's very personal for me because my family (and every other Japanese-Canadian, for that matter) was divested of their civil rights and their possessions (including houses, cars, fishing boats, farms, etc.) the day after Pearl Harbor, then sent to a camp in the B.C. Interior until the end of the war, then given the choice of being relocated east of the Rockies or deported to a war-torn Japan. Well, since most of them were second-generation (i.e. born in Canada) and some didn't speak any Japanese, the only viable choice was to be sent to Ontario. They were only allowed to return to the West Coast in 1949, to start over from nothing. Meanwhile, two of my Dad's sisters (my aunts) had died of tuberculosis that went untreated (no use wasting medicine on ""dirty Japs"", right?). The menfolk in my family (including my 15-year old Dad) were sent to remote areas to build logging roads where my Grandpa broke his back. He was partially paralyzed and lived with excruciating pain for 15 years before dying of complications from that injury. Every other member of my family who was alive during that time was traumatized by their experiences and mostly refused to speak of them 'til their dying days. So, yeah, I agree with George Takei comparing internment camps to concentration camps. Anybody who says that we can't draw parallels between the two needs to educate themselves. Even the U.S. government called them concentration camps (refer to the Munson Report), for fuck sakes. That was practically a textbook on how to demonize/dehumanize/brutalize a group of people. Now, here you are... setting up ""detention camps"". Are you going to own this one? Are you going to speak out about it? Or are you going to shrug your shoulders and pretend nothing is happening (or even join in) like common German citizens did in the '30s and U.S. and Canadian citizens did in the '40s? If you don't say anything, then you're complicit. If you don't intervene, you're complicit. Never again.
On a less strident note, The Terror: Infamy was filmed in Vancouver and its surroundings, so George Takei has been spending a lot of time here. A couple of days ago, he gave an interview about trying to educate people about the internment in an effort to both reconnect with his roots and to prevent something like this from happening again. Quite an articulate guy. Great voice, too, as you all know.
I know thats a joke, but actually Erebus and Terror were originally bomb ships (i.e. they hosted giant mortars!). This required them to be built stocky and strong to handle the recoil, and ideal for conversion to 19th century 'ice-breakers'. The names are more appropriate for their original use of pounding land based forts into submission...
You are the MVP. Blocked in South Africa too.
I love Dan Simmons work for the most part, reading The Terror was a real slog. Good Luck

Also consider visiting the Chinreisha shrine, which is ""dedicated to all war dead, regardless of nationality.

No, on being fucked over by your Government...
Indeed. I haven't made it to one of the camps, but plan to. I'd also HIGHLY recommend a musical called Allegiance. It tells the internment camp story eloquently and clearly. It was based off the events in George Takei's life. Pro tip: take lots of kleenex.
It has a horror theme, so The Terror suits it just fine.
lets speak up and say no to this. this is the pai hole talking for isp's
state + corporations = can't have nice things
Spoken as designed. Pai is just a lightning rod for criticism. He's doing a job he was hired to do. Telcos found someone with no shame willing to take on all the blame and be the public face of this travesty. Meanwhile the real architects of this go unnoticed.
Is it just me, or does everything Pai writes sound like a perfect example of Orwellian doublespeak?
Big Government conservatives hate states rights or any form of local government that doesn't surrender total power to the fed. Remember: All conservatives argue in bad faith, and have no morals/faith/compassion. Their entire way of thought is wired around harming as many people as possible. There are 0 (zero) exceptions.
All this article needs is another snapshot of Pai's smug face. Actually, his smug face already haunts my mind. I'm impressed the Republicans have managed to put together such an all-star team of corruption. Last edited by Dzov on Thu Jun 20, 2019 2:54 pm
Once upon a time, Conservatives were the proponents of States' rights.
The FCC's argument is so deeply flawed. Multi-family properties have plenty of incentives to provide and upgrade wiring to their tenants. In the case of a condo, there is a governance in place to address this and people can decide on their own what they want. In the case of rental units, well, if you provide no or crap wiring, you'll either have to reduce your rent or see tenants leave for other properties that aren't idiots. Wiring, like kitchen equipment and whatnot, is and should remain part of the rent. That's how property owners will have to recoup the ""lost income"" from their cozy shitty arrangement with ISPs.
Does he have evidence to support this, or should we give him a few weeks to talk with his ISP masters to whip up some bullshit?
That was never actually true. Theyve always simply been the proponents of whatever harms people the most. In that case it was being proslavery and pro-owning people. The greatest loss they ever suffered was losing the the right to own not only a person, but all children of that person too, forever.
WOW that's some mental gymnastics! ""Building owners are upset their wires are worth less (?), since they can't get bribed into exclusive deals, so now they won't upgrade their wires anymore"" but also ""Several building owners have previously installed duplicate sets of wires to allow multiple companies to provide access"" So the wires are too expensive to upgrade... but it's not too expensive to put in multiple networks? 5G is going to devour these people.

Ajit Pai, making the world safemfor telecom monopolies!
How is this even the concern of the FCC? Past the demarcation point the wiring belongs to and is the responsibility of the building owner. In particular with DSL. I've been in the situation in rental property where the wiring wasn't up to snuff and they either tell you too bad or want to bill you for it.
What's stupid is all a competitor needs to do is plug a freaking cat 6 into that apartment's patch port and done. It's not like some sort of line-sharing voodoo.
And they will be again, once the Democrats retake power in Washington.
It seems like everything about the main motivation of the current party in power can be boiled down to this.
Agreed, but Starlink. That will disrupt telco business like nothing else had in the past 100 years. Better yet, telcos are so sure in their monopolies and so sure in their existing hamfisted approach to maintaining monopolies, they aren't perceiving it as a threat. If they did, SpaceX would have had great difficulty obtaining launch permits and spectrum for their sats. Telcos would have made sure of it. But nope been smooth sailing so far.
If you ask them, they still are.
They're Republicans. They don't give a fuck if they tell you with a straight face that two plus two is five and that the moon is made out of Hamburger Helper. If they ""win"" their argument or enact whatever policies they want to enrich themselves and their corporate masters, that's all that matters.
* ""Authority"" not applicable to regulating ISP's
Maybe I read this wrong, but I doubt it because Pai. Wtf happened to ""state's rights"" and actually owning your property? How the fuck can any business claim the inside wiring? The owner paid a private contractor, not the ISP provider, to wire the building. The ISPs don't own any of that interior infrastructure and the owner can let access to those wires as they see fit. Wtf? Edited because typing on phones is hard Last edited by acefsw on Thu Jun 20, 2019 3:03 pm
Conservatives never believed in state's rights as anything more than a useful tool/lie to use against others.
This reminds me of their competition analysis, where they counted an entire zone as being served by an ISP if they served a single customer. If you don’t like your apartment’s ISP, move to another one...that also has only one ISP! It’s amazing how he can talk about supposedly robust competition out of one side of his mouth while regulating it away with the other.

That's not the issue here. The rule in San Fran is that building owners cannot force ISP exclusivity on their tenants. San Fran is requiring that multi-tenant buildings have to offer their renters the option to determine their ISP.

So, the hippy liberals in San Francisco are for free market competition and the Republicans at the FCC aren't? SHOCKING. /not really shocking
Eh, state's rights has always been code for slavery, so make of their lie what you will. It's either a dog whistle for those in the know, or a great lie for the guliible and ignorant
I thought the FCC abdicated its authority?
I read it slightly differently, but there certainly seems to be a morass of contradictions here. It seems ‘obviously’ right that if the cabling was paid for by the building owner/manager then that should be available to be used by any ISP to serve a tenant whose service charge is ultimately funding that installation, and cozy monopoly sales are deeply undesirable. OTOH it also seems reasonable that if an ISP actually put up the cash to cable up a building - in exchange for, if not a monopoly, at least preferential access to the residents - they should be able to be reimbursed if a different provider is using their install. It’s a lot like the Free House vs brewery locked pub situation: the brewery tied ones are almost always worse, but if the brewery hadn’t funded the cellar equipment they probably wouldn’t be there at all. Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for!
Government overreach is another GOP flag to wave when something threatens the dominance of their Masters or their profiteering. But when that overreach can wrap one steely hand around your testicles while the other robs you blind it's not just ok it's the patriotic duty of the government to shake you down as enforcer for the rich.
We'll have to see how the antenna for these system look and where they need to be located to provide a reliable and fast connection, but I suspect these services won't do much to disrupt internet in multi-tenant buildings. Most of them already have rules about not having satellite antenna on balconies and whatnot. And ISPs will probably just make sure those that don't already have these rules in place will implement them. But if the antenna can be just placed at a window, then yes, it might change the game some. On the other hand, they'll be a godsend to people in rural areas.
That was when ""states rights"" were about subjugating brown people. This is not that.
Of course he is, because he's a butthole. Is the action anti-consumer? Then he's going to do that. It is the way of buttholes. This particular thing seems like overreach. Why is the FCC concerned with whether or not property owners can recuperate their investment in wiring?
States Rights! as long as they don't bump corporate rights!!
I realize you guys are doing A/B testing with article titles, but somehow I got both. The main mage listed: Quote: FCC to kill S.F. rule that brings broadband competition to apartment dwellers I then clicked through and the title changed to: Quote: Ajit Pai tries to kill San Francisco’s attempt to spur broadband competition If I may, the first title sounds like an actual news organization reporting an issue. The second sounds like you're out to get Ajit Pai(not that he doesn't deserve it). C'mon guys, you're classier then that.
And? I just said, still with a spelling a mistake on edit, that owners ,according to San Fran, can let access to any or multiple ISPs their infrastructure as they see fit. That is, they can let access to multiple providers. If I read this correctly, and it's entirely possible I didn't because I am half lit in NYC day drinking because I finished my programming job early, but as I read it, Pai is saying ISPs can force the owner to lock into only their service, because reasons/ lack of competition. I am basing my judgement on this ""Any further rule changes coming from this proceeding likely wouldn't involve sharing of infrastructure, as the Pai plan argues that ISPs ""are less likely to invest in deployment"" if they know they have to share network components with other providers."" So, I may be drunk as shit, blurry eyed, but I am pretty sure I get the gist of this regulatory, for private profit, not consumer friendly bullshit. If I am wrong, please correct me

How are the airpods a deal?
The refresh airpods with the wireless charging case is normally $200. The regular one without wireless charging case is $160.
Just a heads up for anyone considering the PS4 Pro deal -- the ""normal"" price right now is $350, not MSRP, so you're only saving $20, and buying through eBay with slow shipping. If $20 more for 2-day delivery or in-store pickup, and probably better customer service, is worth it, then you might want to look elsewhere. On the other hand, $20 is enough to buy a decent game that's a year or two old.
I think I'm picking up what you're throwing down: Wireless earbuds that charge, right next to say, a ps4 pro. For a mere $150 bucks more you can get video-out, the ability to play games and talk to friends, play movies, record and stream. Essentially, he is saying they are over-priced for what they do. But there is nothing weird about that, since they are from Apple. I think this drum has been beat long enough, we now have the song memorized.
It's a great Work mouse - maybe only beaten by the Master 2S (slightly better battery and sensor). The great battery life means you very rarely use the Micro USB. I only charge once a month and it's pretty quick. I love the gestures as well, and the app allows for lots of customization. The button in the thumb grip is a great hidden feature.
I think links are missing for the 2nd (1080p web cam) and 5th (wireless mouse) items in the list?
The newer version of that mouse, Master 2S is also discounted!
I had this same problem. uBlock Origin deletes the link entirely even though the little counter icon doesn't show that it blocked anything.
Good catch. I still had the link there, but I also have ublock disabled for this site. After enabling and refreshing the page, the link disappeared.
I love my G203. The classic shape fits my hand perfectly, the tracking is flawless, and the buttons have a nice tactile click. Great mouse!
Apple AirPods (Latest Model) with Charging Case for $179.99 at Amazon (list price $199). Did you miss this part or something?
Does this device support a mode where it uses existing Sega CD hardware instead of it's FPGA if it detects the device is plugged in, yet still streams the ISO through the cart?
Wait, is my old SegaCD worth $300? I may need to pull it out and hit Ebay. Well maybe after I finish Lunar again at least.
That would not be possible, since the Sega CD handles the optical drive itself.
This is super cool. Having said that growing up there were Nintendo kids and Sega kids (this was determined by what system you had at home)... and about those Sega kids: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krwyCx-ko_s
I was highly tempted by a CDX that I saw in the window of a shop in Manchester during a visit to the UK last month; that was £320. But I told myself: I'm sure it'll be cheaper on eBay, and then I won't have to fit it into my luggage. Despite its reputation for terrible FMV games, the Sega CD could actually do a lot more than the Super Nintendo or any other console of the era. Core Design got a lot out of it for non-FMV gaming, see e.g. Battle Corps. Last edited by Thomas Harte on Thu Jun 20, 2019 12:57 pm
It is stated in the video that Virtual Racing is not supported. That cartridge has it's own processor in it that the Mega SD does not emulate. Also Terra Onion is working on an adapter to connect the Mega SD to the Expansion port on the side and then you will be able to run the 3 32X CD games.
Fascinating. I've got a Mega EverDrive X7 and a Model 2 Sega CD; the latter's got a dead battery and I've been thinking of getting it fixed. (The X7 can emulate the memory cartridge, so I can still save games, but it's annoying to have to reformat the system memory every time I want to play a Sega CD game.) The price on this is a bit rich for my blood at the moment, but it's something to keep an eye on. ETA:   You can legally purchase Genesis/Mega Drive ROMs on Steam; no cartridge required. Sega's Genesis/Mega Drive Classics are just unencrypted ROMs bundled with an emulator. Last edited by Thad Boyd on Thu Jun 20, 2019 1:02 pm
I wonder if this works with the Mega SG?
I'm not saying this entire article was written in order to snag some sweet Sega hardware... I'm just saying.
It's already been confirmed it does, which isn't surprising.
Was very happy with Sega CD emulation on my Mac/pc.
Tell me about it - I bought 2 Sega CDs and 4 Gensis(es?) for $75 ten years ago… was a sound investment it seems.
Wait, I have Fahrenheit, Corpse Killer, and Night Trap on 32X. I'm pretty sure Slam City was also 32X, so there are at least four. Edit: A quick DuckDuckGo™ search reveals there were six. http://www.poprewind.com/6-sega-cd-32x- ... they-made/
Specifically: the four you mention, plus Supreme Warrior and Surgical Strike. But I think every single one of the 32X/Mega CD titles had previously been available as a regular Mega CD title — they're all FMV titles which gain only a video quality boost in the rerelease.
I'm wondering if this works without the Sega CD BIOS? If not, then you still need the original hardware (though a non-functioning unit will suffice, legally, as long as it can be started to extract the BIOS).
You'll need to load a Sega CD bios into the MegaSD for it to function with software.
Hey! Don't forget the PSX Classic! ... On second thought, go ahead and forget that one...
Will purchase just for Kriss Kross: Make my Video compatibility.
Kriss Kross, gonna make you... buy a $260 Sega CD reimplementation.
It makes me really happy to see passion projects like this come to life.

I understand that, I'm wanting to use the rest of the Sega CD hardware and leave the optical drive out of it.

lol, early consoles and their use of megabits instead of megabytes. and the funny math they would use to inflate the bits the machine was and the over all nonsense all the specs where
I'll never understand why this niche FPGA based project isn't fully open source and community funded. It would benefit greatly the retro scene and wouldn't risk becoming an expensive, esoteric vaporware in the long run.
Not necessarily the first CD Rom adapter. Besides those that require modifying the system, TerraOnion also developed and released the ""Super SD System 3"" adapter for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx awhile back. I think I may have to pick up the Sega one, this is great to hear!
Neat! I never actually had a Sega CD as a kid. Always wanted one, but also couldn't justify the cost since there weren't that many games I wanted to play on it. Heart of the Alien and maybe Sonic CD; I can't even remember any others...
If only this could be sold as an attachment for the Sega Genesis Mini and in the shape of a Sega CD Mini. I'd buy on first sight.
So go ahead and start it. Or do you mean that you don't understand why other people aren't doing the work you want them to for free?
Maybe the original motorized disc drive version in working order. But the model 2 SEGA CD's go for $100-150 on ebay. I have two. One since I was child, and one I picked up last decade on ebay that included a Model 1 HDG Genesis. I'm not selling either of these.
0/10 troll, weak effort
TerraOnion reached out to me to clarify that it *will* work with your model of Genesis, so the article's been updated. Apologies for my misunderstanding of the RetroRGB video.
Someone asked about whether anyone was working on a FPGA Sega CD about a month and a half ago on reddit. Nobody knew of one https://www.reddit.com/r/fpgagaming/com ... _projects/ Funnily enough, one person conjectured ""TerraOnion could. They don’t announce products until they’re released.""
Sweet, and actually how that model has always gotten the short end of the stick for often legitimate technical reasons due to it being a late life budget redesign I didn't have my hopes up. This is surprising and welcome news. Now to decide if it's worth the price tag etc...

That was made by Majesco under license from Sega for just the NA market. That said, the official announcement video from TerraOnion shows Genesis 3 support. See the 26:25 point on this video: https://youtu.be/8fE0GR9prQE?t=1585 BTW, it looks like the Nomad will have to be modded to play CD-Audio, and also maybe to play Master System games. https://forums.terraonion.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=998
You're right that it wasn't made by Sega and by the company you mentioned.
AFAIK the Megadrive and MegaCD are world wide name of the consoles with the exception of the USA market... So why do you keep using the localized name instead of the world wide one? It might made sense in the early 90s when the US market was the biggest one, but its 2019.... Here in EU, and Asia i bet, (that has more people than the US) we all know this machines by their original names: Sega MegaCD and Megadrive. (And this now is the MEGASD... Not the SegaSD). Genesis was a cool localized name but SegaCD was not (imho). MegaCD is way cooler.
Because Ars is primarily a US run publication, for a primarily US audience, and this article was written by a US author. That said, Ars did refer to ""MegaCD"" in an article a UK author wrote: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/07/ ... -to-html5/
They would, wouldn't they - desperate as they are to ensure that their practices are not classified as gambling and regulated accordingly....
You have got to be kidding me...
I threw up in my mouth a little reading that headline because the smell of BS was so overwhelming...
I hope EA just goes out of business. They are a cancer in the gaming world. Free up all the talent to work on real games again.
Totally exonerates the loot boxes. Very ethical, very fun.
I said this yesterday on the Twibber and I'll say it again here: Unless EA is gonna start mailing a tasty piece of chocolate every time someone spends real money on virtual loot boxes, come the eff on. (Plus, since he said this in Europe, that means he can't skimp on us with that American butyric acid chocolate garbage, either.)
Sorry, when little kids disobey parents and wet themselves instead of taking a two minute toilet break; and older players die while playing for several days continuously, that is addiction, not passion.
hahahahahahahahaha! Oh, wait! You're serious? Let me laugh harder! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I had to double check the execs title because I immediately thought this was some lawyerly double speak. And...   Username checks out. Sigh.
Sometimes the defense of something is all the proof you need. When someone says ""I'm not racist, but ..."" you know you're in for a ride. When someone says something is ""quite ethical and fun"" you can basically guarantee it's neither. Because nobody describes anything like that, ever.
The real surprise comes when you get your credit card statement. How fun!
Surprises you pay for! *snort*
To play devil's advocate, Hearthstone does not mail you chocolate when you buy a pack of in-game cards. The arguments as to why other loot boxes are different from that case have never been fully convincing, to me. And there are some people that consider Hearthstone to be part of the same problem, but there are definitely some who think digital CCGs are the ""OK"" exception for some reason Last edited by Kyle Orland on Thu Jun 20, 2019 4:37 pm
Like used car dealers with the word ""Honest"" in their name.
Kudos for the Futurama allusion. Man I wish that show were still around, or that they at least were still making the movies.
Man, did you really need to include that bit about gaming addiction? Now I very tangentially agree with a small portion of their argument. But like the rest of the responses: WHAT THE FUCK EA!? Loot boxes are ""fun surprises""? Yeah ok.
I drop my coins into a machine, pull the lever, and I may or may not get something worthwhile in return (a jackpot). GAMBLING! I pay money for a virtual lootbox, open it, and I may or may not get something worthwhile in return. NOT GAMBLING! /s
""Fun"" is sort of like ""funny"" (well, besides the obvious shared root): If you have to tell someone you're funny, then you aren't. If you have to tell people that a mechanic is fun, then it isn't.
You say ""date rape"", I say ""surprise affection"". Its ethical and fun!
He may have a point that there are retail products in which you get randomized items, of variable rarity, sometimes in which some possible items have extremely high resale value while others have low resale value. For example collectible sports cards, or Magic cards, etc. And those might be gambling too. I don't think the contents of Kinder eggs or Hatchimals are ever high value enough to meet that threshold. Last edited by jdale on Thu Jun 20, 2019 4:38 pm
""I think the use of the term addiction unfortunately masks the passion that our players have and the joy they get from our game."" I'm sure lots of people have a passion for the joy they get from heroin, too.
I don't play EA lootbox games, and I gave up Hearthstone ages ago so I can't remember exactly how it works. But if you buy a pack of Magic cards, something I at least know about, then yes, it's random, but not entirely so. You're guaranteed a certain distribution of rare and uncommon cards. Do the EA lootboxes work like that? Are you going to always get some level of 'rare and valuable'? Even if it's not the skin you wanted? Or is it truly random?
Since EA seems to so strongly believe that these loot boxes are both ethical and fun, then let them walk the walk and have them in the game for free. After all, people like surprises amirite?
Just more newspeak. Games and loot boxes are not addictive, they are just one more surprise, to be opened, then again, then empty your wallet to the developer, then again...
FIFA loot boxes do in fact work like that. They publish the odds, even. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018 ... -laid-bare
Of course loot boxes are ethical and fun for the payees.

Quote: EA: Loot boxes actually “surprise mechanics” that are “ethical and fun” I don't understand what that says. Is it just me? ON EDIT: I think I figured it out Quote: EA: Loot boxes are actually “surprise mechanics” that are “ethical and fun” I would substitute something else for the second ""are"" though.

""Surprise Mechanics"" sounds disgustingly similar to ""alternative facts"".
Yeah. I mean have you guys tried heroin its really good. https://youtu.be/ZNsx7iYFNlM
It's like I tell my coworkers when they ask me to explain a joke: If I have to explain it, it's not funny. Just let it go. I failed.
I don't know how Hearthstone packs work, but if they're like physical CCG packs, then you are *guaranteed* a certain spread of rarities. Sure, not all rares are crated equal, but at least you know you're getting one rare. And you can sell those (physical or digital) cards for real money. You can also buy the ones you want as ""singles"" without the randomness (even if only on secondhand markets). Loot box items often come with EULA restrictions that ban selling them for real money. And they usually are not guaranteed to have anything of value. There are too many rarities, and too many junk items. I do see that they are conceptually similar. But when it comes to the law, we are allowed to look at *intent*. The intent of randomized booster packs in CCGs is very different than the intent of randomized loot boxes in FPS games (or similar). Packs are the core of CCGs. Especially when you play booster draft or other ""limited"" formats. Loot boxes are add-ons that are in no way central to gameplay and are only intended to create a revenue stream for the developer. Last edited by thornburg on Thu Jun 20, 2019 4:44 pm
But if I buy a Hatchimals or Kinder egg I don't get tangible advantages in life. For example loot boxes in some games are for unlocks, you can earn points to open the box or money that advances your progress in the game. When I buy a Hatchimal I'm not going to end up with a cash bonus at work or a better credit rating. Granted these are the more egregious types of loot boxes versus purely cosmetic but I believe the analogy holds.
Oh, okay then. So let's say ""software piracy"" is just surprise mechanics for EA's accounting department that are fun. It's a stupid analogy but less so than the original statement because I didn't bother to call it ethical.
If EA were defending standard loot mechanics, I would agree. Ditto Crackerjacks. But paying real money to buy a lot box with in-game mechanical effects is a whole different ball game. What a bunch of mealy-mouthed assholes.
Reading this comment is quite ethical and fun. 😉
Here's the thing. If I go into Target and spend $50 on a ""surprise toy"", I will get a toy that is supposed to have the value of $50. In Canada you should see the look on kids faces when they open a Kinder egg and get a puzzle vs. a car. That's what is happening with loot boxes. What I don't want is to spend $10 on a loot box and get the value of something that is worth $2. That is a lottery.
EA's name for loot boxes is inspired by the famous ""Spring Surprise"" by Whizzo Chocolates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3B0gjEjTs ""Our sales would plummet!""
I'm getting a slight Addams Family vibe from that family. Now if only that tubby guy who reminds me of Otho from Beetlejuice could light a lightbulb in his mouth. I'm also picturing the ending being like The Cabin in the Woods in that Spoiler: show the ritual killing they feel they need to complete is for a very good reason and not in their heads. Not Armageddon bad like The Cabin in the Woods at least.
nevermind
Shouldn’t ads be marked as such?
What kind of pathetic dimwit would be ""entertained"" by this sort of trash?
You don't *play* the Most Dangerous Game - you *are* the Most Dangerous Game.

Huh, Samara Weaving is the niece of Hugo.
Samara Weaving in another schlock horror has me interested. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed her in the Babysitter and even her small role in Three Billboards.
I was going to post a similar question. This seems less like an article and more like a press release. I guess Ars Technica has to pay the bills somehow.
The thing that really drives me crazy at Ars are the so called ""Dealmaster"" articles, which seem like pure advertorials, complete with Amazon referral links. It's journalism ethics 101 that you don't run paid ads as if they are regular news articles (although this principle seems to be largely lost on many web based news sites). It's the number one thing that disappoints me with Ars and undermines their credibility as a news organization.
Simple solution: pay for Ars. Then you won't have to put up with Dealmaster articles that explicitly state that they have Amazon referral links. To get back on topic: just because someone likes something doesn't mean it's an ad. Not everyone wants to play a cynical douchy teenager on the Internet.
What's the ethics concern here? The articles are just a big list of links, there isn't any biased review or anything involved.
FF S. They clearly disclose their piece of it. Just like in a newspaper, flip past that page. Maybe even subscribe, if you’re so offended by “ads.”

This is a big no no in journalism and I said, it's just basic journalism ethics 101. Every serious new organization understands this. It's not rocket science and not hard to get it right. They covered a preview. What is your malfunction?

Well... that trailer pretty much covered the whole film so no need to see it now.
I think I’m missing something..   what does “red band” mean? I’ve never heard that terminology before, and google is turning up nothing relevant.
I stopped reading here. It's not any judgment on Ars, I just love horror comedy. It might be the most criminally underexploited genre in all of modern cinema, and remaining unspoiled is a worthwhile endeavor in my book. For those you uninitiated in the glory of horror comedy, let me recommend: 100 Bloody Acres Tucker and Dale vs. Evil Anna and the Apocalypse Shaun of the Dead Warm Bodies and more! Seriously, the genre is underappreciated. Watch more horror comedy!
I didn’t know myself. Googling revealed many other tech sites saying the same thing about this trailer so I thought maybe they was just trying to be cool and repeating the PR jargon without understanding what it meant. Then I found this: https://www.commonsensemedia.org/youtub ... on-youtube Red Band basically means a web-only adult-level trailer with the swearing left in.
It reminds me of the a scene from the Lost Boys film: ""If you read the TV Guide, you don't need a TV""
“If you never did you should. These things are fun and fun is good.”
But doesn't surviving a wedding night of terror, dead maids and bloodthirsty in-laws wielding medieval weaponry make the morning sex THAT much more gratifying?
To this list I would add: Severance One Cut Of The Dead Happy Death Day What We Do In The Shadows Idle Hands Rare Exports (and the two short films) Teeth
a joke my friend and his family like to live by. The Family that Slays together Stays together. Of course that is in reference to family gaming together in RPG, and MMPROGs. a family playing fortnite, and diablo 3 before that, etc. This seems to take it to a just plain stupid level.

This. It's called ""native advertising"" and I recall reading a journalist article of the NYTimes how pervasive it has become and how the editorial side of the NYTimes thinks it's the future. Scary!
Oh, that’s satisfied my curiosity, thank you kindly.
I hope they explain how, if they truly feel like the have to kill the partners of their children, do they ever have descendants? They either succeed, and no grandchildren, or they don't, and what, something bad happens? (Maybe the children ARE the bad thing that happens)
... They explicitly say ""Dealmaster"" on them. It's the first word of the headline. The first paragraph talks about deals they're sharing. And then at the end of the body, it says, ""Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs."" What exactly do you want? Does everything have to be labeled ""AD"" for you? I get that you don't want to be advertised to, but these things are deliberately set up as lists of things to buy. (Which I suddenly realized I haven't seen in a while, because I subscribed to Ars. Funny how that works.)
It is a US thing. Most trailers start with a green screen stating that the ""preview has been approved for all audiences"" which means that the theater can show it before any movie. Trailers starting with a red screen warn about coarse language/sex/violence and can only be shown before R-rated movies (where you have to be 17 or older).
It's funny - I knew exactly what they meant, but you're right that all references to the term on google appear to either be for this movie or are quite recent. It means it only runs before R-rated movies. You see the band (red or green) right at the beginning of many reviews in the theater. It's the MPAA notice thing that says ""this preview has been approved for restricted/general audiences"". Last edited by Peevester on Tue Jun 18, 2019 7:47 am
The weird thing is that this red band trailer doesn't actually feature the red band.
The joke is that it's both.
True! I was wondering about that too, but I don't think you HAVE to show them except in theaters, which is pointless there too because you're either in a theater showing an R rated movie and red-band trailers are fine, or you're not, and you won't see them.
Huh? I'm a subscriber and I see them in my feed on the main page and the RSS.
I had to load up a second browser to see them. O_o
What is dead may never die.
Lovecraft might disagree: ""That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die.""
With that cast this movie will either be awesome or irredeemably horrible,I am really hoping for awesome.
After watching the trailer, it looks it is going be so terribly horrible that it's gonna be awesome! Can't wait to see.
That fourth to last pic in the picture montage, I swear that remindes me of Alexander Shpak. I wonder.... Edit: Google that name at your own risk. Eye bleach recommended.
love Jarmusch. didn't like the movie much. It's so lazy, even if It has its moments. It's exactly what I would have expected from a zombie-sploitation flick made by Jarmusch. Without the tiniest modicum of surprise. yawn. and it had such a great cast. I should rewatch ""only lovers left alive"".
I saw it on an early preview showing and it's a pretty decent comedy Zombie flick. Especially since I could not figure out where it was heading. I was definitely disappointed with Chloë Sevigny's character's development. Of course Bill Murray played his normal low key character to perfection. The star studded cast was underused, but understandable considering a lot of them were playing bit parts. My favourite moment in the movie was when we all got to see Adam Driver's character's car key. ;-) It's definitely an enjoyable movie. If someone likes ""campy darkish Zombie indie comedies"", then it's worth it to go see it in theatre, else wait until it comes out on a streaming service since it definitely does not need to be seen on a big screen. Spoiler: show Just had to get this off my chest. The only picky plot point I have with this movie is that if it's going to sort of break the fourth wall, it had better get the reference correct: Since Bill Murray's character had stated that he read his parts of the movie, he'd know how it ends as well as Adam Driver's character since they both share the same end scene. He claims to no know what happens when Adam Driver's character does. Edit: Grammar change that corrects the meaning of the sentence about Chloë Sevigny's character's development. It's amazing how much difference one missing ""'s"" makes. Last edited by bbf on Sat Jun 15, 2019 6:16 pm
So... what’s with the reviews lately? I disagree with Sam most times bit he is at least in line usually with other reviewers, and I can see where he is going though I disagree with what he uses as objective qualifications for ‘good’ film. Jennifer tends to consistently be completely opposite of pretty much everyone else, professional reviewer and audience alike. And this one is ranked pretty poorly by both reviewers and audience goers again. Are people just putting down how they ‘feel’ about the movies anymore rather than objectively determining if they are good or bad based on writing, character development, method of communicating the story, etc. as reviews should generally be?
What is death without life?
Reviews are inherently subjective editorial; it's all ""how they feel"".
While I agree that Jennifer's reviews definitely have a contrarian streak to them (that MIB: International review ... woof), Occam's Razor suggests that she simply has ... eclectic tastes; I don't think she's doing Armond White or Zizek levels of trolling. I mean, heck, my favorite bad movie of all time is the 1994 Street Fighter, and I will defend Prometheus until my dying breath. Different strokes and all that. That said, I do agree with her statement that The Dead Don't Die is going to be pretty polarizing. I was always skeptical, especially after the most recent (awful) trailer, because while I adore Jarmusch's work, I never quite felt that he was the best fit for a zomb-com. I didn't much care for the movie, which is disappointing considering the cast's pedigree.
I agree with your view on Prometheus (and Alien: Convenant). I'm eagerly awaiting part 3.
Most critics are falling victim to their own genrefication tick boxes... I saw the film as an almost absurdist satire of modern hollywood films, and on a deeper level, what moves us culturally.
So, I just got back from the theater, and came across this review. In short, don't waste your time or money on this even at the dollar theater or torrenting it, this was really, really bad (and not in a /good/ bad way). Just for perspective, I like other zombie movies (Zombieland, Cockneys Vs Zombies, Shaun of the Dead), and campy movies (Zoolander, Clue, etc.). They tried to stuff in all of the current popular things like breaking the 4th wall, good actors & actresses, but it just didn't work at all. This was as bad or worse than ""The Association"" and can only have a future in a MS3K revival.
That is definitely breaking the fourth wall.
The thing is, the characters never directly address the movie audience. They only talk to each other, but are sometimes aware that they are actors in a movie. So I agree with Jennifer that it's ""sort of"" breaking the fourth wall, but not ""entirely"" breaking the fourth wall. ;-)
No need to be... would you expect your English comp teacher to judge your papers based on ’feel’? Movie reviews don’t have to be subjective, there are very clearly defined reasons for why things work and how they trigger people and their emotions, as well as easily objectively measurable ideas of quality, given the context of funding and obvious goal/intent, that can be quite definitively used. People who understand that make good movies (such as say Nolan’s Memento, or even Carpenter’s Last House n the Left), and those that don’t end up being like Jon Peters with Wild Wild West. Yeah the latter may be a fun adventurous romp (just like Police Academy) still doesn’t make it not crap. Hell I admit I have guilty pleasures, doesn’t mean if asked about the quality of said guilty pleasure I don’t own up to the fact it is objectively crap but for whatever reason I personally enjoy it (again see Police Academy). And when we’re talking $75-100 to take a family of four to the movies I would prefer not to be wasting it on mindless objective crap. That is what streaming is for, it’s also why I find reviews suspect because they get comped tickets. If you’re the one spending $20 plus concession costs it changes your opinion as to value.
Directly addressing the audience is just one way the fourth wall can be broken. It's not the definition of the term, just an example of it. Any time the characters show that they are aware they are in a work of fiction, the fourth wall has been broken.
Who wouldn't see this? Granted, I'm terrified every time a movie has a huge A-list cast due to the ""movie"" Movie 43, but not this one.

Yes, I would, because outside of pure grammatical and linguistic correctness, the grading of English (or any writing) can be highly subjective and very much based on ""feel"". Teachers can give wildly varied grades on the exact same work. Consider the case of Carpenter's The Thing, for example. On release, it was almost universally panned as trash. Today it's considered by most to be a classic for the same reasons it was originally considered trash. Did the objective measurements change? There's no theorem equivalent to ""1+1 always equals good writing. Instead, there's a generally accepted consensus on what constitutes good writing. Can you define an objectively ""measurable idea of quality"" for me?

Yes, I would, because outside of pure grammatical and linguistic correctness, the grading of English (or any writing) can be highly subjective and very much based on ""feel"". Teachers can give wildly varied grades on the exact same work. Look at the case of Carpenter's The Thing, for example. On release it was almost universally panned as trash, yet, today, it's considered a classic. Did the objective measurements change? There's no theorem equivalent to ""1+1 always equals good writing. Instead, there's a generally accepted consensus on what constitutes good writing. Can you define an objectively ""measurable idea of quality"" for me? Playing devil's advocate, yes, there are things which are universally considered bad writing. It was all a dream, deus ex machina, retconning cliffhangers, god did it, the conflict ball, plot holes, failing to obey Chekov's gun, etc.. I would argue that any script making significant use of such tropes would be objectively badly written. The existence of people who liked the work doesn't change that analysis, it just means that those people don't care if the writing is bad. But in general, I agree with you. It's not really possible to make an objective analysis of most movies. However, that doesn't mean there's no objectivity in the process, or that some movies aren't objectively bad.
No offense to Jennifer but her tastes often directly oppose mine. So I'm not sure now if this movie is any good, and I was previously excited to see it. Edit: Perhaps it's one of those things where it's safer to just dislike most movies so people think you just have high standards than it is to enjoy movies. Perhaps that's why critics kinda suck. Keep up the positive reviews.
Either way, I feel compelled to watch it. I was wondering if Jarmusch might have cast Johnny Depp as a zombie, in a kind of metatextual pun on Dead Man, although I’m fine with not having him in any more films. I will be disappointed if Tilda Swinton’s Scottish mortician doesn’t say “We’re all doomed!” at least once.

I disagree with Sam most times bit he is at least in line usually with other reviewers, and I can see where he is going though I disagree with what he uses as objective qualifications for ‘good’ film. Jennifer tends to consistently be completely opposite of pretty much everyone else, professional reviewer and audience alike. And this one is ranked pretty poorly by both reviewers and audience goers again. Are people just putting down how they ‘feel’ about the movies anymore rather than objectively determining if they are good or bad based on writing, character development, method of communicating the story, etc. as reviews should generally be? Reviews are inherently subjective editorial; it's all ""how they feel"". No need to be... would you expect your English comp teacher to judge your papers based on ’feel’? Movie reviews don’t have to be subjective, there are very clearly defined reasons for why things work and how they trigger people and their emotions, as well as easily objectively measurable ideas of quality, given the context of funding and obvious goal/intent, that can be quite definitively used. People who understand that make good movies (such as say Nolan’s Memento, or even Carpenter’s Last House n the Left), and those that don’t end up being like Jon Peters with Wild Wild West. Yeah the latter may be a fun adventurous romp (just like Police Academy) still doesn’t make it not crap.

Teachers can give wildly varied grades on the exact same work. Consider the case of Carpenter's The Thing, for example. On release, it was almost universally panned as trash.

There's no theorem equivalent to ""1+1 always equals good writing. Instead, there's a generally accepted consensus on what constitutes good writing. Can you define an objectively ""measurable idea of quality"" for me? There are certain rules which are universal within context, which addresses your Thing statement. For example if you re-read the original reviews that bash it you will notice one consistent thing about them, they ignore the context of what the director was trying to achieve and the story he was attempting to tell (a reimagining of ‘Who goes there’) and from that perspective it was a success. The characterizations, logic of the story, etc. all works. One of the biggest criticisms of the story for example was ‘the issue or the Thing taking over people would have easily have been solved by the buddy system’ but that leaves out the context of the environment, the fact that they were already stressed, etc due to their current work environment, and the fact that people who participate in said programs tend to be heavy type A personalities that think they have all the answers, and adding the Thing to the equation pushed them over the edge. It’s not that it was a bad movie/story it was that the reviewers didn’t take into account the context surrounding the setting. Same thing with why I believe the Last Jedi was an objectively bad movie because when it is taken in context with everything we know much of it makes no sense, and the wholesale lifting of scenes from previous movies makes it lazy. Yeah sure people may love it, I love an old HBO movie called Cast a Deadly Spell, doesn’t mean it is objectively a good movie and I am ok with that. To me it shouldn’t be about taste, it should be about when taken in context of everything do the actors perform well, does the story make consistent and logic sense, is it told in an appropriate manner, what is the quality of writing (again in context), quality of cinematography, editing, dialogue, music, etc. As for different grades for the same work I never experienced that. When I was in school I could show the same paper to different teachers/professors and unless they were being lazy the criticisms were fairly consistent. If I didn’t provide a compelling hook, didn’t follow logical progression (again within context), properly established the story, etc. they all universally said so and left their opinion out of it. Just like in music there are certain rules that work and are known to work for a reason, and unless you establish the reason for why something violates said rules it is kind of a bad idea to just randomly break them (to use Memento as an example, it breaks the rules of forward momentum in the story by telling it backwards in snippets; however, early on it establishes that it is from the point of view of the main character whose memories last for no more than 5 minutes so it works because it establishes in a logical fashion why the expected rule is being broken). But yes one can absolutely quantify quality within the context of a work. It’s why things like music theory and film appreciation exists.

So I agree with Jennifer that it's ""sort of"" breaking the fourth wall, but not ""entirely"" breaking the fourth wall. ;-) I wonder if that would be more about being genre savvy as opposed to actual fourth wall breaking, since the fourth wall is literally the wall between the movie and the audience and thus, kind of requires that the characters address said audience in order to break the fourth wall. [/pedant] More likely a case of medium awareness, though reading ahead in the script could be a more accurate trope. Sajuuk wrote: Can you define an objectively ""measurable idea of quality"" for me? To be fair, there are some things that are objectively good or bad as regards quality in a movie. If a plot has holes in the writing with no indication that it's meant to have those holes, that would be a problem, objectively speaking. Then there's issues with special effects and whether they accomplish the desired result (the recent Aladdin movie, for example, has some issues with the effects of the genie that could be a real make or break issue for some viewers sensitive to such issues). Stuntwork, sound editing, costuming, camera work, etc, etc, etc. All of those can have elements that are able to be objectively critiqued as well as things that are more subjective or related to style preferences.

The recent comment regarding context is a good one.
You mean https://youtu.be/V7NlFWh7Sz8
I am deeply suspicious of Tilda Swinton, she hasn't aged since she first appeared in Orlando the best part of 30 years ago.
I'm glad someone called out the 'everything is subjective' line. In art too, many things depend on skill and experience which can be objectively looked at.
Either she is a vampire, or the makeup is getting thicker. Judging by the photo in the gallery...
Yep, objectively, in the opinion of 19th century critics, Von Gogh couldn't paint.
In the case of TLJ, I'd say that a better story flow could have been put together with the given elements, reordering story and plot between TFA and TLJ, at least for the masses. Whether the writers were too accustomed to highly disjointed and out of timeline sequences, or using memory/backstory explanations too heavily due to plot holes, I don't know, but while I had little issue with either movie, there is understandable criticism that I can acknowledge but doesn't apply for me. I readily admit having Luke's flashback of training Ben Solo (Kylo) should probably have been near the beginning of TFA. (I just checked, apparently these were last minute additions, so filling plot holes - bad writers)
Van Gogh was part of the post-impressionist movement. He was in regular contact with successful artist of the day and his critical reputation was growing. If Van Gogh mental health issues hadn't curtailed his work before his suicide, he would have been an established artist. The popular legend isn't true.

So I agree with Jennifer that it's ""sort of"" breaking the fourth wall, but not ""entirely"" breaking the fourth wall. ;-) Directly addressing the audience is just one way the fourth wall can be broken. It's not the definition of the term, just an example of it. Any time the characters show that they are aware they are in a work of fiction, the fourth wall has been broken. The Collins Dictionaries disagrees. Quote: (esp of a character in a television programme, film, or play) to refer to, acknowledge, or address the audience, usually for comedic effect or as an avante-garde technique https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/di ... ourth-wall The TV Tropes site has a pretty good article about it and acknowledges that it is sometimes used in a broader sense now rather than the original theatrical definition. Quote: Breaking the fourth wall is when a character acknowledges their fictionality, by either indirectly or directly addressing the audience. Alternatively, they may interact with their creator (the author of the book, the director of the movie, the artist of the comic book, etc.). This is more akin to breaking one of the walls of the set, but the existence of a director implies the existence of an audience, so it's still indirectly Breaking The Fourth Wall. Named for the theatrical convention of building sets with right, left and back walls, while the audience observes the action through an imaginary ""fourth"" wall located at the front of the stage. Breaking the fourth wall would occur when the actors would step through where the virtual fourth wall should be and address the audience directly. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ ... FourthWall So with most things, the definition of words/phrases changes over time, so we're both correct.
I saw the movie yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can understand how the film isn't for everyone. Several side characters dont contribute much to the main story, and Chloe Sevigny's arc comes to a rather abrupt end, (although I would argue that her arc fit the overall tone of the film as a whole) People have pointed out that the film is a sort of sendup on the zombie genre, although I would argue that the movie is more specifically a sendup of George Romero's films, especially: ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""Dawn of Dead"" both of which are obliquely referenced a number of times. Lastly, I'll just say that I loved the fact that Tilda Swinton's character basically existed as a way to point out just how weird the real life Tilda Swinton is.
Sounds like you need a good dose of Zombieland or Warm Bodies, truly inventive takes on the genre. I get the Jarmusch criticism: sometimes his style is refreshing, at other times not so much. This is definitely one of the not-so-much instances. It's not unusual for indie auteurs to hit or miss in the extreme ... David Lynch and Hal Hartley come to mind.
Jarmusch gets regularly panned by mainstream critics, but there’s not a single movie he’s directed that I haven’t enjoyed - often immensely. Aesthetics are always, to some extent, a matter of taste. You have to find reviewers who share your sensibilities and put stock in the ones you trust. Jarmusch is decidedly offbeat.
I was a bit reluctant about watching it at first because most reviews I read didn't really like it. Then I thought ""well, it's Jim Jarmusch, probably they just didn't get it"" and watched it anyway. And exactly: This isn't a film about zombies at all. It's a film about zombie films in the disguise of a zombie film. Jarmusch casually kicking down the fourth wall and just as nonchalantly breaking the genre with that UFO just underlines this. So if you really want to see a zombie film you probably will be disappointed, but if you like films and cinema generally you certainly will enjoy it a lot as a kind of homage to zombie films (as I did in fact). Also in some ways it may be the first ""zombie"" film for all of the family. And the cast is thoroughly enjoyable anyway. And there is a real film nerd in it.
Good Jarmusch film, not such a great zombie film. Still worth the price, IMO.
Hemsworth and Thompson had great chemistry in Thor: Ragnarok. I was not a huge fan of the original MIB series, but looking forward to this one!
Odd. The rest of the internet seems to think it is worse than rolling in a flaming pile of bubonic herpAIDS. MIB with out Will Smith and the other guy? Yeah........
I'm not particularly interested in seeing a Men in Black movie. I am interested in seeing another Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth flick. Thor: Ragnarok was so much fun that I'll probably give the MiB reboot/sequel/whatever a chance.
That's the first even slightly positive review I've seen of this movie. It's literally been treated as a lovechild of AIDS and Ebola.
Yeah the first was good (and the animated series too for that matter) but it sure degraded. Thompson and Hemsworth have the making of a good comedy duo from the looks of things.
For the weakest in the series, it was the highest grossing one of the series world-wide. I didn't see it, myself. I must have missed the announcements of the release. Gonna have to see if I can find it streaming somewhere. As for this, I'll probably do the same. It's cheaper here to buy a DVD than it is to go to the theater with my wife, and the DVD has the nice feature that you can watch it again without paying for it twice. That's just the habitual penny pincher in me.
I think the more general consensus is that 1 was a masterpiece and 2 was the weakest of the series with 3 somewhat redeeming it without reaching the heights of 1. Anyway, this is a streaming watch for me too. It might have some good comedy - I did love Thor: Ragnarok and their chemistry, but not enough to get me into the theater given the likely weaknesses of the film. I can wait a few months.
Huh? Most reviews I've seen were kind of meh, as in ""Talented cast and crew, but the script doesn't give them much to work with. Lightweight entertainment.""

Quote: and a Hollywood franchise was born, reuniting Smith and Jones one last time with Men in Black III (admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy) in 2012. Have I been taking crazy pills today? 1 > 3 > 2 in terms of quality and Rotten Tomatoes agrees with me.
More like 1>>3>2. 3 didn't have enough Tommy Lee Jones in it. This sounds watchable (if only for the chemistry between the leads), if dumb. Probably rent or stream it, doesn't sound worth the theater experience.
Yeah...this seems to be suffering from 'sequels that are trying to hard' syndrome. From another review:
They missed an opportunity to go for Hi-C with Neeson's character
This is the 2nd movie in the last week that is getting good reviews from Ars but getting critically panned everywhere else. Just kind of odd...
Well like any good theatrical disaster there's the ""official narrative"" and then there's the honest reviews. Take your guess as to which is the official narrative.
Ars also hated the new Godzilla movie; I haven't seen it yet myself but I know several hard-to-please Godzilla fans who were quite happy with it.
It happens quite regularly, but it's nothing strange. Tastes in movies are subjective after all - you CAN find other positive reviews of this movie if you go to Rotten Tomatoes. Not many, but they are there. Most likely Jennifer just has different priorities when watching a movie compared to the majority of reviewers out there.
From other reviews it sounds like a lot of that chemistry was as much due to the script and director as anything. This one is getting a lot of bad reviews. The first one was a classic while the next two were pretty flawed albeit with a lot of fun moments. With this one I'll probably be waiting for it to appear for rental.
""Miraculously, the sequel, Men in Black II (2002), was almost as good"" Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....
Nah even a lot of the negative reviews mention their great chemistry. Of course, a lot of them also say that they are not allowed much time to show it due to the bad script. But it seems the chemistry is real.
Not even that interested in Men in Black, but I'm glad to see a positive take on it. I often find myself feeling like Abed in Community: ""I guess I just like liking things."" I enjoy most movies I watch. People take Rotten Tomatoes and critic reviews so seriously these days, at least a couple times per year it's like a middle of the road film is the worst thing in the world. It's ok for a film to be ""OK."" But its like we sacrifice a couple films every year to the movie gods and everyone just hates it for no reason. It's OK to enjoy a 5/10 or a 6/10 movie.
Recent ars reviews have been quite positive towards movies that are otherwise panned. Men In black International (5.4 imdb, 39 metascore) Dark Phoenix (6.1 imdb, 43 metascore) Rim of the World (5.1 imdb) See You Yesterday (4.9 imdb, 73 metascore) Detective Pikachu (6.9 imdb, 53 metascore) Wandering Earth didn't get a review, but it did get an article (6.1 imdb, 53 metascore) Maybe ars is doing everyone a service by finding good points in otherwise unappreciated movies, but my takeaway is that any movie that gets recommended here is probably something I can safely skip.
It's not just you. I attempted to watch 2 again recently because I had blocked it out of my memory. A few minutes in, I remembered why I had blocked it and stopped watching. It's like what you get if you take MIB and get a couple of 12 year old boys to rewrite it. All sorts of gags that don't fit the plot, grossness/violence/etc. just for the ""fun"" of it without any real reason behind it, and no ability for the film to laugh at itself or its genre. 3 at least brought new elements to the table, even if it didn't always handle them all that well. Personally, I enjoyed the concept of the MIB universe, but could have done with a different take on the stories told within it. Looks like that was the idea with this movie, but while they got a great cast, they didn't fully execute on the script.
That's at the high end. It varies between that and pretty bad panning (aside from one Salon review). https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/men_in ... op_critics Last edited by Oak on Fri Jun 14, 2019 5:21 pm
3 with the crazy time travelling nonsense? Nah. 2 was better.. But I won't fight you on it, they were both mediocre.
I watched MIB:International on Thursday. My spoiler free feelings: It's not good, it's not terrible, it's mildly entertaining if one doesn't activate one's logic circuits and think about the plot holes. If you're a fan of shiny chrome weapons this movie is for you. If you want interesting interactions with aliens, this one is light on that. If you're expecting great chemistry between the two leads, you'll be disappointed, there just is not enough material for them to work with. I'd wait till it reaches streaming release if I didn't have an AMC A-list membership. I certainly would have been a bit disappointed if I had to pay $19 to see it in IMAX.
Is something a franchise, just because it is more than two? Or is that just american expression. Anyhoo, number one was good, and the sequels maybe, but let's not kid ourselves here: They are not Naked Gun nor Hot Shots material franchise, if we are looking at solid additions of light american entertainment. Do you have reservations?
Shame on you for saying ""the other guy"" instead of Rip Torn. The man provides grace and wit to Also, using Ghostbusters to exemplify hemsworth's ""comedic chops"" makes me question the taste of the reviewer. His character was a detestable one-note character whose sole trait was ""I'm stupid"" and was then used to poor effect by centering on the actor because can't have a decent ghostbusters movie just stand on the busting of ghosts... gotta get that Thor cred. My viewing of the trailer benefited from pre-Godzilla Excitement halo, so I have some goodwill for it, plus Emma Thompson acts quite well. Still, this review suggests it's about on par with a gargoyle ""losing to a bird!""
Low bar after the 1st one...
I just watched it today, and as others have said, it's not the greatest piece of cinema, and the world does not require it to be. It was a fine watch, some jokes are great some are not. I'm pretty sure anyone watching a trailer would have guessed the ending. This is an excellent popcorn flick; great to watch on a hot afternoon to spend time in a cool and dark theatre. Honestly i look forward to buying it or streaming it and playing it in the background while doing things around the house. Some movies are great for that, and some force you to sit and watch them all the way through. (The greatest movie for this to me is Knight's tale, I've probably watched it a hundred times or so in the background) Let's not kid ourselves: a lot of people are watching it for the Thompson and Hemsworth on screen chemistry, and while there's less of it than in Ragnorak, it's still fine. I liked the world building, and I particularly like US centric films expanding into an international cooperation type movie (John Wick), particularly in my sci-fi, and hate it to go the other way (looking at you Kingsman 2). And by that I really mean I like seeing how it plays out in the larger world. I similarly dislike the human and watch centric focus of the latter Mass effect games. The script probably could have been better, but it was okay. I've had no interest in rewatching 2 or 3, but mostly because I really don't care about character development for either J or M, I just want to watch a monster of the week. After watching it, I realized I think I would enjoy some kind of Monster of the week MiB TV show, and have to look up the cartoon series. This movie showed more personality to the background roles in such an organization. MiB-1 showed J jumping directly from detective to field agent in 2 days with no training. Thomson's M (is everyone's name just their first initial? how does that work for all your IT and immigration personel?) at least gets a few weeks intro training before field work and effectively works her way into field agent which is nicer to see depicted. So overall I like the world building. Honestly between the different roles an ensemble MiB tv cast could have, it could go monster of the week or explore the role the MiB plays in galactic politics. it could really almost be something like a star trek movie set in contemporary era: have episodes of biological aliens as analogies for immigration and refugees, particularly as the earth and it's military might are insignificant to the forces of the Galaxy, so states craft backed by some expertly placed big guns, save the day. So in summary: fine summer popcorn flick, that brought some refreshing ideas and additions to the MiB universe, without really marring the extant films.
The whole reason MIB3 didn't have much Tommy Lee Jones in it is because he had a miserable experience shooting MIB2 (in fairness, pretty much everyone did), and he only agreed to do the movie if his role were restricted to a five-minute cameo--that's where the entire time-travel plot came from, because Jones wanted nothing more to do with the series. In fairness, it did give us Josh Brolin doing his amazing Jones impression, and given that the movie's production was a cluster and a half, to the point that production was shut down for several months so half the script could be rewritten (for example, Stuhlbarg's character was only cast a day before his first scene was scheduled to be shot), it's a miracle that the finished product was as good as it wound up being. Ell oh effin' ell at the idea of MIB2 being almost as good as the original. You can probably count the number of good comedy sequels on your fingers and not run out of fingers, and MIB2 is not one of them. Holy moly.
Wouldn’t exactly call titles to reviews along the line of: “Erase The Awful 'Men In Black: International' From Your Mind” -NPR Is stating it is meh.
Basically. If they had to rope in MIB to get them together, so be it, but I'll just pretend the second movie didn't happen and the first one was as good as the cartoons.
The author definitely sees movies in a different light than most of Ars' readers I'd venture to say...
Rotten Tomatoes has one quarter of critics positive, three quarters negative. And for audiences... it's flipped, three quarters positive. Those are the ones I personally care about. Heading off to watch myself shortly.
Indeed...Ebert’s site has it at a whopping 1/2 star. Wow, that is NOT good.
The divide between the 'omg it's the worst thing evar' and the 'eh, it's ok for it to be just ok' is quite entertaining. It seems like the former have only read reviews, while the latter have actually seen the thing. A gram of going and finding out is worth a metric tonne of talking about it.

Dr Sleep was a pretty solid book, but Stephen King's work is really hit or miss when it hits the screen.
I have a feeling that this will be good if Ewan McGregor is involved.
With Mike Flanagan at the helm, I am excited as HELL for this.
The true horror - antivaxxers!
""HELL😊"" General Kenobi!
Erm, wasn't Carrie his first best seller, including in hardback? From my understanding it is what launched his career and was on the NY Time bestseller list while in hardback.
""We can add him in post!""
Casting Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat is fucking inspired. Perfect. I always imagined her as a younger Angelina Jolie, but Ferguson is always a little otherworldly.
I love Kubrick""s version of the Shining. I've never read the book or this sequel, but if this exists in the Shining Cinematic Universe (three words I never thought I'd type together), then I'm interested. The premise sounds a bit convoluted but hopefully Flanagan, who did a masterful job with Hill House, can steer it true.
I was surprised by how solid the book was. Not terribly innovative, a lot of ""small Vermont town loner"" King tropes, but at this point those tropes are kind of like a comfortable old pair of jeans. And it resolved the storyline of The Shining in a really nice way that resonated with me as the son of a (sober, now) alcoholic.
Kubric had this way of framing scenes without any dialogue. Modern filmmakers should take a cue from his films (2001 Space odyssey was another great one)
Couldn't agree more. These days his works seem to be better fit as a mini series. Otherwise we end up a Power Ranger-like movie like Sleepwalkers.
Kubrick was a still photographer early in his career, and that experience follows through into his cinematic work. He has tremendous attention for framing.
I've said for a while now that Steven King's works should be on some form of prestige television. I have hopes that Castle Rock will be a good anthology series, but that's exactly what most of his work should be. Obviously with books we get to hear the internal thoughts of the protagonist in a way you can't do in TV or film, but what makes his stories work is slow tension built from a twisted sort of magical realism. Instead of wonder, there is dread. While some movies have been good, it's hard. I think you need that creep of doom coming to really make the horror he writes effective. Cramming it into a couple hours, and you leave stuff behind. Sometimes it's smaller plot, but more often it's character development. And you desperately need that, I think, because seeing how the horror of a situation changes people is what makes it powerful. The first season of True Detective is, I think, a fantastic example of that slow burn existential dread, and it didn't even have anything mystical. I'd love to see what the folks behind that could do with some of Steven King's better works. If Pet Semetary had been an HBO show with those showrunners, I can't even imagine how creepy and powerful it could have been. Smush it into two hours and all the tension is let out of it.
You are a bold one!
Mostly miss. I recently ran through a list of all his film adaptations. Even with a very generous definition of ""good"", less than 15% succeeded. Seeing the unnecessary callbacks to the first film in this makes me think it's not going to be one of the lucky 15%. Seems like yet another attempt to cash in on the goodwill from properties that were made before Hollywood became creatively bankrupt. ""Hey, remember that thing you liked?"" does not a good movie make.
Even mini series are on the miss side. I didn't love Mr Mercedes or 11.22.63. Both were phenomenal books. I do have high hopes for the Dark Tower, but we'll see what happens with that
IMHO The Dead Zone was the best direct adaptation of a Stephen King novel. It followed the book pretty much directly and was also pretty good.
The book didn’t impress me that much, but maybe I’ll have to read it again if I haven’t donated it yet.
I caught that too. If it relies too much on the first film to carry it, there will be problems. Spoiler: show Convenient that the hotel wasn’t destroyed in the Kubrick film, unlike in the book. I wonder how that will affect the theatrical ending.
I disliked pretty much the entire final half of Dr Sleep (and I'm a massive King fan). I know his books can be long, but it felt almost like someone else wrote the second part. I forced myself to read the whole thing when it first came out, then tried re-read it a few months ago but gave up about two thirds of the way in. But this trailer actually looks pretty good!
The movie looks nice, I didn't like the book to be honest, but maybe the movie will change my mind.

Nope, Carrie didn't become a bestseller until the paperback release: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_(novel)#Publication_history Quote: The hardback sold a mere 13,000 copies; the paperback, released a year later, sold over 1 million copies in its first year.
Yes! Doctor Sleep is a great example of modern Stephen King... More interested in characters and how they're affected by events, rather than the events themselves. I really enjoy them not so much for the 'horror' (which I feel is less of a focus for King these days) but for the characters and places he can illustrate so well with his writing style. I honestly think King is a victim of perception because of his early classics. The modern stuff is its own flavour (which I like)... And if you're reading them for scares you'll most likely be let down. It's a catch-22 for anyone making an adaptation.
The trailer suggests this movie is trying to leverage the iconic imagery of Kubrick's The Shining to sell itself. The book Dr. Sleep has relatively little reference to the book The Shining.
Being in the Star Wars prequels will really do a number on your psyche. Just ask Jake Lloyd.
Surprised to hear the movie is going to hew so closely to the book. The trailer didn’t give the vibe at all, especially given the frequent references to another movie the DRASTICALLY diverged from its book. Which wouldn’t be a bad thing if this did diverge. I found Dr. Sleep enjoyable, but it had some major flaws. Rose wasn’t a great villain. The concept of the True Knot was great, but their weakness became obvious way way too early, and their confidence turned into arrogance when it became clear how unearned it was. It didn’t help that Agra was far too powerful. Danny in The Shining (bath book and film) was powerful, but he didn’t know how to use it, which upped his danger considerably. A bra is even more powerful than Danny and in full control of her abilities. With the True Knot already not living up to their threat it robs the back half of the book of virtually all its tension. I was more interested in seeing HOW things played out (quite well, to be fair) then concerned about what would play out.
Flanagan x McGregor? I know what we'll be doing on November 8th, and hopefully at the over 21 movie theater!
It's the much-hyped sequel to the greatest feel-good movie of all time! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMIpkQJt02g
I'm about halfway through it, and I'm loving it so far.
King is such a great character writer, and I think that's a large reason why his movies fall flat -- they don't have time to properly develop them.
I suspect the references to the previous movie in this first trailer are mostly to let the general public know that this is about ""characters you know already"" Because ""Doctor Sleep"", on the face of it, doesn't say ""The Shining II""

I'm cynical too about how the trailer leans into the first movie in order to sell, but then, didn't I also buy the book for the Shining connection after ignoring the last two decades of King's dross? However, the Overlook, Dan's memories, and those ghosts have a decent sized role in Doctor Sleep so I don't think 'unnecessary' or 'relatively little reference' are true.
Agreed. The Shining is my all-time favorite movie, and I had high hopes for this one. But literally everything interesting about this trailer is from The Shining, which really has no place in the Dr. Sleep book at all. Dr. Sleep could be a decent movie (rather than a mini-series, or whatever) because there's not all that much to it - it's not an epic story, like some King works. But nothing about this trailer makes me want to go see it. ""Danny returns to the Overlook"" misses the point of the book.
I hear you. I am actually quite stoked for this movie, I found Doctor Sleep to be the best thing King has written in the past decade and can only hope he does something similar with a sequel to Firestarter telling us what happened to Charlie McGee. [minor spoiler ahead] One of the things I don't get in the recent trend of the King movie adaptations is the pointless race-lifting of characters that completely shoot holes in or force a direction away from plot-points in the book: With Abra becoming black now, the family link explaining where she got her intensely strong Shine from as she is Dan's unknown niece when Jack Torrance had himself a piece of Abra's mother before the events of The Shining is completely blown, as are other less important aspects of the story. I have no problems with black characters or actors except when they are shoehorned in for some kind of 'woke' points and severely impact the story. Look at The Gunslinger. Idris Alba is one of my favourite actors but he is NOT Roland Deschain, and him suddenly becoming black would have completely hosed the main narrative of book 2 to the point where they just gave up on using it. And the movie completely sucked balls. Hopefully they can make the change work without negatively impacting the story, this is one of the few areas where I have concerns (Rose the Hat dosen't look at ALL like I imagined her to, but that's on me not the writing/staffing dept.) and I still expect it to be very VERY good.
I agree. And Mike Flanagan. Along with a great premise.
""For those not familiar with the story,..."" Oh, surely this line is written for people who are not horror fans. Isn't this like writing a story about Christmas and needing to explain Santa Claus or Jesus?
Not everyone has seen everything, and The Shining is getting pretty old. Seth Meyers did a joke last night that referenced Ed McMahon and it bombed. See the 5:52 mark: https://youtu.be/X3BaiNBMtpU?t=352 But it's ok, some people are just part of today's 10,000: https://xkcd.com/1053/
What's up with Diet Coke and Mentos?
I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would, but the most surprising part was learning that the Mother robot character was created with 100% practical effects—it's a guy in a suit. Adam Savage over at Tested has a great video where he talks to the WETA engineer dude who built and acted inside of the costume. It's hella cool.
I enjoyed it. It was also kind of ambiguous at the end, which I also enjoy.
This is on my (frankly too long) list of shows to watch. Thanks for the interview.
Also really liked it, certainly enough to be most miffed when my Netflix download decided to tell me it was corrupt half way into the film on a flight without wifi.... Absolutely love Moon and nice to have a high quality cerebral sci-fi on Netflix too. More of this please.
I've to admit that the movie was quite amazing from every single point of view. Especially if you consider that there is a guy inside the suit of ""mother"" all the time. There is very little CGI involved Plus dammit ... One AI portraited as it should be intened ... frankly what she did, is what I would have done myself in the same position with the same ""power"" at my disposal. Tense all the way to the end. The only downside I find to the movie is, like many post ""apocalypse"" ones ... is that I want to know moooore! How it all began!!?
I think the director's name is wrong. It is Grant Sputore, not Sapore.
I always enjoy movies that have some kind of AI as the main character. I dream to one day earth will be populate it with AI beings walking on Earth.
It's good movie! I liked it! It's not super original, but it's done very nice. I also think, movie end is much darker once AI ask: ""Do you remember your mother?"" (This is not a spoiler, you will only maybe understand when you watch it.)
It's on my list now. But I have to question why they would raise only one human to adulthood. Our social nature being pretty much a major part of what defines ""human"". Though I'll grant the film would be less interesting with 3 children.
Your question gets an answer.
You need to watch to understand, but this is not ignored in movie. It's addressed.

Here's my take (with heavy spoilers)— Spoiler: show We see at the end that the ""APX"" container is missing three embryos—APX01, APX02, and APX03. We learn that one of the children, APX02, doesn't work out and is incinerated (the text and images on the data pad that Daughter finds makes that pretty conclusive). Daughter is APX03. We know that because that label is all over her tests and screens and stuff. APX01, therefore, is almost certainly Wounded Woman (Hillary Swank). I believe that Mother raised her to early childhood (which would explain her comment about having seen the Tonight Show ""a long time ago"" — it's not that she saw it when it was originally airing, but rather that she saw the same set of recorded TV in the facility while she was a child). Then, at a certain age, Mother put her out of the facility, with the intent of having Woman function as a control or safety valve or future variable or whatever in the raising of APX02 (and, when 02 was discarded, for 03/Daughter). By the end of the film, I was pretty convinced that Woman showing up when she did wasn't accidental—it was a key component to Daughter's ""test,"" including and especially the coincidental timing of Woman's appearance. It seems like there were additional human survivors outside of the facility and that Woman was taken in by them, but over the years they turned on each other or otherwise died off, probably from sickness and lack of supply. It's also possible that there were no survivors and Mother just implanted memories or something, but that seems less likely—it's a lot simpler if Mother had selectively sheltered a small group of humans from annihilation and then dispatched Woman to them. I like that it's left purposefully ambiguous, since it gives us plenty of room to talk. But it seems reasonably clear that the director intended for us to come to the conclusion that Woman is APX01. edit - d'oh, that's what I get from going by memory rather than double-checking. changed my labels around. thanks, paulej72!
I enjoy movies that make me think long after the credits roll. I went to bed 🤔. And I am greeted one morning with this fine article for more 🤔 Spoiler: show I found it fascinating Mother was able to embrace the darkest parts of humanity. Indeed, rather than a detached objective entity, AI is a reflection of who we are. I think it was Asimov's robots, in one story, that encountered the same problem with humanity, but chose to leave Earth and let humans sort out their problems on their own.

Then you (and probably everyone else here) would enjoy Spielberg's A.I., which has the situation reversed: artificial intelligence kid wants to be loved by his human mother.
Spoiler: show The aborted girl was APX02 as that was the code on her record tapes. Wounded Woman was APX01 and was grown and released early as her job was a test of the final passing Daughter
Some questions (from what I can remember): Spoiler: show - What happened to the dog? Did its fate have anything to do with the origami figure left on the beach? Are we to assume only humanity was annihilated but not all other (biological) life forms? - Mother had just explained to Daughter that her form was but a single node in a distributed, but singular, intelligence. Moments later, she invites Daughter to shoot her in the CPU. Was this the One CPU to rule them all --- despite the still fresh reveal??
I saw the trailer last night when I was popping in to watch my evening The Office (I had only ever seen through season 3. So my wife and I are FINALLY watching the whole thing). It looked good. Also not sure I am ready. I am dealing with the realization in the last year that my mother is a secret narcissist (and has been for my whole life) and the controlling and manipulation that entails. So of course hearing mother talk about how she loves daughter, knows best and believe her, etc. was causing me a bit of anxiety. I think I'll still enjoy the movie. I also think I am probably not going to sleep that night and might have a whole 'nother sessions worth of material to talk to my therapist about.
Re: your second question— Spoiler: show It's partially symbolic, because there's the dramatic Campbellian trope that the hero must kill his/her mentor in order to grow into that role, and also partially practical because it's the easiest and most demonstrative way to terminate Mother's presence inside the facility. She didn't kill Mother and she knows it—she just told Mother to gtfo.
No!, ""I am Mother!""
Overall, I thought the film itself was very well done. The ending emphasized the long term planning and the frightening intelligence an AI would manifest. If you haven't seen the film stop reading now!! Sorry if people consider this a spoiler: It seemed to me that Mother had planned the entire event sequence with the objective being Daughter successfully passing the final test and accepting the truth.
Whatched this a few days ago, with no expectation, and have not watched any trailers. It was a slog in a few places but overall its really enjoyable and I really like how it was presented like a Detective movie, and the ending is the final conclusion of all the clues scattered all along the movie.   IIRC it actually have a pretty clear ending that already ""pre shadowed"" at various points. It was a fresh thing for me. Due to tons of Hollywood movies left me hanging at the ""open"" ending.
Knowing human nature as much as I do, that was my first thought. Humans are gregarious, and tribal. In isolation, they tend to grow up ""wrong"". The ""feral children"" who were raised by wolves (or whatever) examples indicate that even in a ""tribe"", brain development is stunted, because it's not the right kind of stimulation for proper social orienting. Mother may be anthropomorphic, but it's not HUMAN. I haven't seen the movie to see how they handled that (assuming they did), but if ""it takes time to be a good mother"" is the case, without the right kind of stimuli as an infant, Daughter could grow up to behave in a way that could be hostile to others, or be reclusive and withdrawn, or a host of other maladaptations to her situation. I get that this is science fiction and stuff, but in a character study like this, one would think that such realities would need to be addressed in some fashion. But it's possible it was skipped (or overlooked) simply for the character study itself by presuming otherwise normal human interactions. If so, they missed a hell of an opportunity to really explore what it means to be ""human"".
I came into the comment to link this video, but Lee beat me to it. Guess he gets to cash that fat Adam Savage video shill paycheck this time. I haven't seen the film yet, and I there are some light spoilery aspects to the video, I kind of wish I'd watched it after the film. But it's just such a cool look at how they pulled off a really awesome practical suit effect. Really worth a watch if that sounds like your kind of nerd stuff. I know it's mine!
Spoiler: show Interesting, thanks. I think this could have been shaped better had Daughter been exposed to e.g., Jung's archetypes and Campbell's Hero's Journey (rather than random Johnny Carson shows that might even conflict with the values central to Mother AI's entire objective). Having an AI cultivate not only humans, but also their humanity, would have made for a fascinating study. Looking ahead, are the other sentient nodes still honoring the initial protocol? In other words, will they allow the new Human Mother to raise some/all of the embryos as well as allow the new humans to reproduce and organize new societies? Will they continue to monitor individuals or the species as a whole? Do they have a nuke 'n pave reset threshold?
I can't help but think of this seeing the title and premise. In any case, it's good to see a Netflix scifi movie that isn't paint-by-numbers garbage for once. I have been earnestly questioning why I pay for my subscription these days with how much they push shitty, selected-by-algorithm films on me.
Fun ride. Straightforward plot. Nothing too sick or twisted (or gory). I liked it for being a good science fiction movie. The only thing I felt was a little bit much to suspend disbelief on was how the AI just relents at the end. That did somewhat fit with the whole idea of it thinking it'd made a ""perfect"" candidate, but I still felt that it was a little too easy. That, and it's still out there. What's to stop it in the immediate future? The end felt a little half-hearted, basically. Otherwise, it was a good flick. Good interview!
Just watched this last night, and really liked it a lot. There were some nitpicky bits (as there are in pretty much any film, of course) but the overall production was very effective and entertaining. For awhile, it bothered me that Daughter didn't have an actual name (and, she'd be aware that people have names simply from watching the old reruns) and she never asks Mother about it. But, then I realized that not having a name helps us be just a bit more disconnected from the character, in a way similar to how Mother actually is. Also: Old Tonight Show reruns? Spoiler: show ~ I was a little disappointed in the ending re: Wounded Woman. I take it to mean there was a murderous bloodbath in the shipping container. ~ As for Wounded Woman being one of the previous APX embryos, it seems odd, then, that she seemed to have no recollection of having been raised by Mother at all. Even if she was let loose from the facility at a young age, she surely would have some memory of it.
I would add one small additional thing I noticed early in the movie: Spoiler: show At the beginning when mother is made it says ""days since extinction event: 001"". Mother seems to immediately put in APX01 embryo into the system. When we jump to the story of what you correctly say is APX03's life, the extinction message is shown again, but this time it states that it has been 13867 days since. Which is nearly 38 years and does not match with APX03 daughter's age. 38 years, however, nicely matches Hillary Swank's character (Swank is 44 in real life). I immediately wondered why it had been almost 38 years and the daughter was only a teenager. The movie continued feeding my suspicion until the final ""Do you remember your mother"" confirmed my belief of how the events took place. Chilling movie indeed.
The AI doesn't just relent in the end, at least that was my understanding. Spoiler: show The AI give the kid "" a chance"" to grow her little brother without mother intervention. Just like she asked. The mother agreed. She leave the bunker by letting the kid shot its node CPU. Dunno why it chose that method. Could be to let the kid shows real determination. Could be due to the door no longer can be opened without destroying it. Could be for theatrics. As mother often do theatrics to manipulate the viewer and the kid.

My wife and I watched this movie on Tuesday night and enjoyed it. I predicted a couple of the twists from some foreshadowing done early in the movie, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. As a standalone movie, I would recommend watching it. If you really want to contrast it though and highlights its strong points, watch Ex Machina the next day (also on Netflix). The two opposing perspectives complement each other.
This movie had me start a new rogue servitor game of Stellaris.
God, that was an absolutely excellent hard Sci-Fi movie I've seen in years. The previous movie which left me with this amount of excitement and pleasure was Ex Machina. Strangely ""I am Mother""'s IMDB rating is kinda low but that could be explained by the lack of flashy things, $100 million budget, and expensive actors. Also, a lot of people spotted the errors which weren't there (i.e. they simply didn't understand the plot). I'll take movies like this one over Marvel/DC/whatever comics any time of a day. This is real Sci-Fi. Not some anti-physics, magical BS about invincible heroes who only die when it's necessary to advance the plot or when their contract with a studio expires.
Seeing the trailer made me think back to some backstory of Horizon: Zero Dawn. Look forward to watching this film soon.
It clearly stated that the body was just a shell, and that it didn't matter if it was destroyed. Its consciousness wasn't just in that individual bot. So, my understanding was that even though it let the body be destroyed, ""it"" was still out there, somewhere. Whether (primarily) in a rack of servers or other machinery blinking behind daughter at the end, or in any number of places. Either way, it felt to me like the AI was simply leaving them alone to do their thing. But, for how long? Seems like it could resume its ""EXTERMINATE"" operations at any time in the future. The overall movie was still solid bit of sci-fi, IMO. As they said, it leaves room for pondering some things and discussion around many of the questionable parts.
My only issue with this movie is that when AI is more advanced than human beings (and it surely looks like that in this movie 'cause AI knew and predicted everything the girl was doing) then maybe it's better to create a new species from scratch instead of trying to raise a new civilization from a girl who's passed quite an intricate test. People can become a lot better when their survival depends on them being excellent. However once our hands are untied we often become ""bad"": bad to other people, bad to nature, bad even to ourselves. I don't say or imply that we're intrinsically ""bad"", no, what we are and how we live/behave are determined by evolution which is not intelligent.

This article is for all of those complainers that whine they don't get enough 'technica' in their ars technica. This a great article on a very interesting subject.
while this work is spectacular, i am pretty sure this has to be ""specular"" ...
Looking forward to the History Channel special where they explain how this is actually stolen alien nano-tech, complete with blurry daguerreotype images of UFOs and alien beings.
Maybe I missed it, but is it possible that colours from the original scene could be reconstructed by studying the arrangements of the nanoparticles?
On a slightly related note. I saw this video in regards to early films and their quality yesterday. Today when we see archival footage it is often played at the wrong speed and from duplicates of the original reels. If you find the original reels, and play at the correct speed (which can vary since often it was hand cranked) its incredible. Video skipped to a great example of the difference of what we are used to and the original quality. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBNwiPg ... u.be&t=426
Nice article, very interesting!
Nanoparticles, history and photography....ahhh. After the deluge of E3 articles, not to mention the Wired article kerfluffle, it's good to get back to peak Ars.
For those interested, the Niepce photograph is at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
I saw an exhibit of Girault de Prangey's work in the MET earlier this year. A painter by training, he had a surprising amount of artistic sensibility in his photographic work, considering that he is arguably the pioneer of architectural photography. We're talking about a medium that had only been invented a few years prior, and here was this guy, building his own modular box cameras, using super-wide formats, working under extremely unfavorable conditions (Egyptian summer) and consistently producing well-composed, well-exposed shots. Would highly recommend if an exhibit finds its way to your part of the country. Edit: When Girault de Prangey visited the Ottoman Empire there were rumors that Ali had given access to his harem in exchange for a portfolio of plates. When questioned about this, his response was ""I swear I only ever saw the door"". Last edited by ZhanMing057 on Wed Jun 12, 2019 11:04 am
i love when your perceptions are debunked like this.
Hello, An interesting photo: This was actually a very busy street, but it shows empty in this photograph. The reason being is that the exposure took a few minutes, so all moving people were massively motion-blurred (below visibility threshold). We can see the motion blur when the exposures are like 1 second or 2 seconds, but motion blur of a multi-minute exposure (needed in early cameras) is so extremely faint that it's like all the moving people disappeared! The only persons that are visible are the motionless people -- the ones doing a shoe shine, as seen at the street corner. They stayed stationary long enough to be accidentally visible in the photo. At the time this photograph was taken, nobody understood motion blur in 1838 -- why people disappeared in photographs was actually considered very godlike behavior by some -- it took a few years of trial and error after the invention of photography (Niépce, 1826, 8+ hour exposure), before they discovered long exposures created motion blur! This was a breakthrough for portrait photography; the astounding discovery that stationary people could be photographed. Last edited by mdrejhon on Wed Jun 12, 2019 1:32 pm
Excellent! Vintage photography is one of my passions.Though it is mostly just hacking old cameras to re-use old lenses on digital sensors. A great read. I always enjoy theses explanations of how the artisans of yesteryear managed to create mysteries only explicable with modern cutting edge science.

That's amazing that no one could solve that puzzle for centuries. The Romans were probably doing it all the time, then the secret got lost.
Hmm. I don’t remember this ever being mentioned in my photo history class. Got a source?
No, sadly. The particles are an artefact of the size of the grains of silver halide on the surface of the original plate. In Daguerrotypes the grains are extremely small, I believe, compared to even fine grain film. Different Daguerrotypes would expect to show different colour casts. You can do the same thing to a degree with print toning. The standard method involves redissolving the silver, and then reducing it once again, in such a way that the size of the grains produce a colour cast - usually sepia. It's possible to tune the grain size to get the shade of brown you want, or even purple. But the colour information is unrelated to the scene. edit - also, importantly, someone below reminds us that plain silver halides are only blue to blue green sensitive.

That's very interesting -- I never thought about how people would not ""get"" motion blur in these initial photographs. Also, I wonder what the consideration of ""godlike"" behavior implied about the moral status of the shoe polisher and his client?
At which point he was then blind-folded. ;-)
You obiviously (EVERYONE interested in this, actually) need to see Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old, which was in the movie theaters earlier this year. It's the most painstaking clean up of old hand cranked film I've ever seen, and tells an incredible story using 100% period footage from the British Imperial War Musuem of World War 1. It's cleaned up, time syncronized and normalized, colorized to exact color matches, lip synced (except, slightly, in one case, where they had to infer what someone was saying in a group, but they were able to discover the original document the officer was reading and put that in), and edited to create an incredibly moving look at what those men faced over a 100 years ago now. The ""Making of"" documentary after the credits is worth the price of admission all by itself, and is over 30 minutes, so it's a must watch if you see this.
Wow, thanks!
ha.. i used to think people in the wwi era walked funny.
Metallic nano-particles, Silver Substrate, narrow blue peak in the UV range, certain people mysteriously disappearing in the motion blur of a camera.... We are talking about vampires right?

As founder of the Blur Busters website and TestUFO motion tests, we are wizards at revealing motion blur nuggets that even many professors/teachers are unaware of. When we were looking at scans of microfilche of some of Sameul Morse's writings in the 1830s-1840s (he was one of the first to bring dauguerrotypes to America -- yes, the inventor of morse code) -- I was struck at how Samuel Morse commented how he was amazed people disappeared from photographs, and initially couldn't understand why (at first). It was very plainly clear in these old articles (target range 1838 to 1839) newspaper articles (pre-portrait era) -- it was obvious that none of these people remotely understood what the hell motion blur was, in these old newspaper articles about the wonders of the invention of photography. At that time, in the pre-portrait era -- all they knew is that living-beings completely disappeared from photographs. They just didn't understand why. There was no way to capture short-enough exposures (e.g. few seconds) to make motion blur visible to give them the ""aha"" / ""eureka"" moment. Moving objects = living beings. There wasn't a distinction just yet, in these old articles, word of mouth was often all living beings disappeared from dauguerrotypes. It's hard to track down these microfilche, but if I find them, I will link it. But you can discover this yourself by limiting your old newspaper article searches (keyword ""dauguerrotype"" and other contemporary early-photography words). Execute your newspaper search of photography prior to the date of the first-ever face portrait photograph, and then it becomes Obvious 101 Batman how nobody understood motion blur. Try the New York Times paywall, though I think the article I read was in a different microfilche. These history nuggets are virtually almost lost knowledge now; since much of these are not easily accessible online, hidden behind newspaper-company paywalls, or deep in academic vaults. EDIT: Some googling finally bore some fruit. Source1 Quote: Samuel Morse, while a fan, expressed astonishment when he realized daguerreotypes of Parisian street scenes showed no people or carriages, because the still rather long exposure time meant that objects in motion weren’t captured. Source2 Quote: At the Diorama, Morse was amazed by the photographic details and clarity of (non-moving) objects in the images. ""The Boulevard, so constantly filled with a moving throng of pedestrians and carriages, was perfectly solitary, except for an individual having his boots brushed,"" Morse marveled. ""His feet were compelled, of course, to be stationary for some time, one being on the box of the boot black, and the other on the ground. Consequently his boots and legs were well defined, but he is without body or head, because these were in motion."" This is incomplete, and misses some of earlier writings of speculating why moving things didn't show in photos. Sameul knew it was motion, but wasn't sure why (at first). He definitely figured out motion blur months later, but at first he didn't. Yet other 1839 writings were more speculative (other authors than Samuel) speculating all living things disappeared, while others realized it was motion itself that caused disappearance from photos -- but it still took a while before mainstream 1830s media got educated. Here you go; examples of lack of knowledge of motion blur of the contemporary 1839 era. Nobody understood motion blur (yet) then. Last edited by mdrejhon on Wed Jun 12, 2019 2:45 pm
Probably not. For one thing, Daguerrotypes and other early emulsions had only a fairly narrow band of spectral sensitivity. It was only later in the 19th century that panchromatic emulsions became available. Re gilding: toning with gold solutions (and other metals, selenium being most common) is still done today.
In fact it was orthochromatic - which was not as described, it was not red sensitive - that was developed during the 19th century, and panchromatic film first appeared in the 20th. It took along time to catch on for three reasons - it was expensive due to the dyes needed, people had got used to the appearance of orthochromatic portraits, and orthochromatic film could be developed by red safelight, important when development of plates was often by appearance rather than time/temperature/dilution.
some of the early russian documentary work was done using the RGB filters separation on three monochrome plates. it was a unique method of capturing actual full (almost) color images long before 'color' film emerged.
Yes, those Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky photographs. Those amazing color photographs are all more than 100 years old. Today, we can Photoshop-align those 3 color layers and see these photographs far better than they originally could back then -- owing to the shrinkage of different colors and such, that could not be corrected for in the era -- creating color fringing artifacts. This is one of the more stunning examples: (Wikimedia commons) This color photograph was taken in year 1911! That's before the Russian revolution, and before the Great War (World War I).
Wow, that's amazing. That's also why the 3-chip CCD video cameras were/are so popular. They have a prism which splits off the colors onto their own sensor which has no filter, and capture all 3 simultaneously so that each frame is really 3 layers which are then combined.
Most of the color photographs were never seen in color at the time. Some of them were projected on a screen, some printed in a magazine. The colors were restored only with the use of computers and digital technology. They call it digichromatography. http://loc.gov/exhibits/empire/making.html Some of the results are spectacular. Spoiler: show
The toxicity of the chemicals involved in this notwithstanding, one wonders, with the push for nostalgic kinds of things, and the novelty thereof, whether or not doing this again as a hobby/business might see some popularity. It might not be an old photo, but the idea of presenting ultra-modern things (computer motherboards, F-35's in formation or something intricate like that) in a daguerreotype photo all fixed and mounted like back in the day sounds like both a potential artistic trend, as well as something fun to do. The steps involved appeal to the hobbyist in me. Gonna have to look into it, assuming I can figure out a way to deal with mercury fumes.
To pick a nit, the first photograph didn't fade and still exists edit link
Edwin Land did some amazing neuro-optical studies, starting with similar triple-exposure-with-filter reconstructions. He left off one of the filters during the 3-way overlay projection and was amazed to find that the image appeared to be in full color! I forget how many different variations he tried, but I do know he found pairs of complementary filter colors that allowed for full-color perceived images, again even with one of the filters left off during image projection.
Trichromatic cameras were a major part of motion picture history. Technicolor began as a two colour process (red/green) when orthochromatic film largely ruled, and became three colour when panchromatic film became fast enough. Three films went through the camera behind red, green and blue filters.
Ever notice how oddly dark people's eyes are in really old photographs? It's because it's nearly impossible to keep your eyes perfectly still for more than a few seconds so motion blur makes them look creepy.
Great article, Jennifer! Coming from a background in electro-optics, this one really resonated with me. : )
IIRC the issue is that evolution isn't guided and isn't intelligent. What works survives. This leads to us having trichromatic colour vision in the eye which is then translated into nervous signals on two channels: red/-green and blue/-yellow. This is why we can see purple (red +blue) but we cannot see a bluish yellow. I believe this is what Land discovered in terms of complementary filters, though I don't pretend to understand the details. Mono images and cartoons work because a lot of the signal processing in the eye relates to edges and shapes, and because scotopic (night) vision is monochromatic.
The first successful color film process called Kinemacolor (1908) used a two-color additive technique that used b/w film and synched color filters for both filming and projection. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinemacolor
As we're on color photography, let's remember Gabriel Lippmann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1908 for a unique method of color photography https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Lippmann
And you won't have to worry about antibiotic-resistant syphilis!
My mate and I sat silently for maybe half a minute when we finished the first episode of the new season. ""Wow."" ""Yeah."" The episode transcended the tech/horror niche, moving into something far more … interesting. Identity. THIS is the question for all of us. Is there any meaningful delta between virtual and IRL? Our take was, ""nope"". New world. New rules. We have a lot to learn. Fast.
I enjoyed the story and acting in ""Striking Vipers"", but I felt like it was just too long. Seemed more like something that could be summed up in a 20 minute adaptation rather than 61 minutes.
Best to stop when the goings good than become mediocre.
This season was pretty weak. The NIN / Carly Rae Jepson / general pop star references in the one with Miley Cyrus were about the only bright part. The whole identity / sexuality episode was heavy on fan service, tropes, and cliches to the point of being annoying and a disservice to any debate. I suppose Smithereens has a positive social effect in showing the US audience the lengths more civilized police forces will go to preserve life / withhold deadly force.

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. “Ashley Too” was a delightful lemon fluff dessert of an episode—no more, no less. And as far as I’m concerned, that is fine with me. Considering the unending sh!tshow we experience day to day in meatspace, the season finale of Black Mirror was pure anodyne, and I’m down with that. Last edited by scooternva on Mon Jun 10, 2019 9:47 am
Enjoyed the hell out of ""Ashley Too"". Yeah, the teen angst was pretty generic, the villainy cartoonish and overbroad, but it was funny and stilly and generally a good way to end the season.
Exactly so. Not every episode needs to be unrelenting and cruel. It was a tightly-plotted palate cleanser—and holy hell, I didn’t know Miley Cyrus could act! I loved it.
I'd have to somewhat agree with this review. 5th season of Black Mirror was a huge disappointment for me. Though I'd have to say that it was more poignant and much more grounded in reality, it was a slog and retreading familiar ground. *SPOILERS GALORE TO FOLLOW* Each episode did have caveats which were glanced over; somewhat alluding to the dystopia that their world has become. - In Striking Vipers, the technology from USS Callister episode is used and fairly widespread. The premise is that people retreat further and further into virtual reality. Entrenching that idea and retreading ground from previous episodes. - In Smithereens, I think the premise was that the tech companies know more about people than police or investigators. The series of scenes where the heads of a powerful conglomerate had more access and insight than the regional police and FBI (going as far as to cut authorities out completely at one point) shows the scales are tipped severely. I don't think the concern was necessarily about the protagonist or his struggles, but rather the surrounding events. - Finally, in Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too, I think the point may have been about transplanting consciousness into another object. This was glossed over and it was actually retreading of the same ground from a lot of previous episodes (3-4 entries I think). The technology has advanced to a state where it wasn't about who the person is, but rather what can be taken from that person using technology. Essentially industrialization of creativity turned up to 11. All in all, those items are muted throughout the episodes. I am not actually sure if the creators were intending for anyone to even focus on them, but I did. Thus the season was very underwhelming for me. Same stuff, much more toned down and sorta boring. EDIT: silly word repetition Last edited by ArsCannon on Mon Jun 10, 2019 10:00 am
Is the tide finally starting to turn on the Non-BBC black mirror? We've had a few articles in a row now where the commentariat vehemently downvoted posts that thought black mirror was going downhill starting in S3 (aka Netflix took over and asked for 6 eps a season). I mean, who could have seen the twist of the robot bees coming! Not the detective who found the hard drive!
Oh look, another season revolving entirely around social media invading our lives, brain recording, and 2REAL4ME VIRTUMAL WERLDZ. Overdone in season 3 and beaten like it owes the mob money in season 4. I guess now the only thing left to do is flog the corpse. Look Chuck, you're out of ideas. Go find a new project or something and come back when you have something as original as 15 Million Merits queued up again.
""Miley Cyrus plays pop star Ashley O., who isn't nearly as upbeat as her pubic image would suggest."" Whoa
I liked the season OK, but it's running out of steam and should probably bow out, based on what I saw, or they need to get some new writers in there. Otherwise it will degenerate into what Archer has become; a shadow of its former self that should have bowed out gracefully years ago. To be snarky, they should be given the following order from the executive producers: ""You cannot involve putting a disc on a person's temple that interacts with their brain. This is explicitly and totally forbidden."" Last edited by Deputy Cartman on Mon Jun 10, 2019 9:54 am
Totally agree on the ""Smithereens"" episode. It made me pause and think, ""I shouldn't even be looking at my phone at a stop light"" and it was a sad story, but less of the twilight zone with tech sort of idea that I'd normally expect from Black Mirror.
""Catherine uses all the neuro-data collected to make the Ashley Too dolls to create a perfect hologram version of Ashley O."" I didn't get impression at all. They scanned the brain of the still alive Ashley to get more music. They wouldn't have gotten that from the doll scan because she hadn't come up with it yet. The hologram didn't need a brain, just a puppeteer in the mocap suit as we saw backstage.
It's really just one writer: Charlie Brooker. There are assists on a few episodes, and one that he didn't write (one of my favorites: The Entire History of You), but it's almost a one-man show. I think it's part of the problem, to be honest. I can only think of one show (Venture Bros) with such a comparably small team that has consistently improved over time, and that's only because Jackson Public and Doc Hammer are fearless idiots who will break cardinal writing rules and eliminate fan favorite characters just because they can. We've exhausted Charlie Brooker's psyche. His greatest concerns for the future have been explored so thoroughly at this point that we all know what to expect now. The thrill of surprise that animated the first two seasons (and White Christmas) is gone. What we're left with is a show that should have been finished in 2016.
I don't know how others feel, but in my world three episodes does not constitute a ""season."" By no means did it have to be ten or thirteen like the big series but c'mon give us at least five or six. I would have gladly waited until the end of the calendar year for that.
In the Ashley ep they glossed over Spoiler: show what was essentially a backup brain in a robot body committing murder (suicide?) . There could have been more meat there, or even an episode itself without the extra fluff and feel-good ending.
I've spotted a couple shows now that Netflix is trickling out, either as individually weekly episodes, or as partial seasons. Kind of annoying.
Fan of the series but thought the first episode was a snooze.
(warning, I have a few spoilers in this) Somehow I watched a different version of Smithereens than Jennifer for it had me crying at the end. I didn't see two themes (unless one is paranoid), but one powerful theme of loss and how people cope with it. The few scenes with the FBI and the corporate folks pulling up data about Chris was, to me, not close to dealing with privacy since all they did was use the data they (and presumably us today give) collect from people who use their program. The theme was about guilt. Yes, the writers used a now standard trope, a variation of texting while driving, to set the plot, but man, that was all about grief, what happens when you can't deal with it and how people use it. Of the three, it was the most powerful to me. The acting blew me away and I loved how the writers didn't cast the police as heavy handed schmucks. I did find the Ashley O story a lighter, fun look at the life of a pop star, again not so much about social media. The technology of Ashley II was a vehicle to help get the protagonists to the final scene (penultimate scene?), which was going to happen the moment we learn about the aunt. The writers poked fun at the pop music world and if Miley had any input, may have put a light on what happens to young stars that want to change, but are locked into a machine, not of their own making. The least of the shows to me was Vipers, though it too was very good in moments. It is hard to say why, I did just find the waters muddied. Was this about internal vs external identities? Do avatars more represent the Id and if so why does it not extend back into the real world? When the two characters decided to test the waters, the scene fell flat,because I cannot fathom a human having that much...passion...in a computer world knowing that the real world person is a man (both directions) yet not have any feelings in the real world. There was a missed opportunity to explore this idea of what truly hides underneath the surface of our ego and do we have the courage to explore it in both realities. The ending was flat, because sorry, there is a vast difference between a virtual affair (one where it is two men in real life, but man woman in VR) and a real physical one. Now they have an open marriage? Who is taking more risk? Why would she need her outlet if he's making her happy again? Nope, didn't make sense. Having gone back into season's 3 & 4 after seeing 5 first my only complaint was that the writers seemed on a one way track with using VR(ish) technology in most of the stories. However, overall the whole series has been well acted, well written, and very much worth watching compared to the tripe presented on regular channels.
I can't tell if y'all are aware of this but 3 episodes a season is how the show started. Long-form, low episode count is how British networks do intellectually-driven shows like Black Mirror.
at this point my hope is lost for something as great as san junipero or white chirstmas to show up again striking vipers was pretty good, and the last one was decent at least, oh and theres a 3rd season of 3% for some reason, i felt pretty sure s2 was a wrap up/cancellation
I thought all 3 episodes were ok or better, but it did feel like the weakest season so far. Ashley Too, which was pretty fun, was basically another cookie episode. Smithereens was intended to be a present day episode, so it's going to have more tech restraints than usual (many of the same problems of Shut Up and Dance, without more charismatic leads). Striking Vipers probably wouldn't have been made if San Junipero hadn't turned out to be so popular last season. I don't think they have run out of ideas, but stretching into very different ideas has been uneven.
For me this season is weaker. And the mortal kombat VR is the weakest. The Facebook episode was much better. It felt like something that could happen today, rather than something in the far (dark) future. Heck, part of it already happen right? With accidents while driving and playing with phone. Then black mirror do its classic hyperbole and we got that episode.
I went on the record in the last article here about the new season, wrote something pithy about how Black Mirror pretends to be insightful and thought-provoking but tends to really be shallow and pseudo-intellectual and serving up ""hot takes"" that rarely go beyond the first paragraph of a moralizing thesis, and was pretty soundly roasted. I really liked all three of these episodes. ""Striking Vipers"" is a really good bit of TV, it throws out an interesting concept, and actually follows it all of the way to a conclusion. Not only does it have a thesis, but it actually expands on it, and offers a perspective on it! ""Smithereens"" is just an engaging, intense ride. Yeah, they make some motions towards big data and snooping, but it's a bit of an afterthought, and nothing about the story really requires it. They could have dropped it and the episode could have worked just as well, and I generally see that as a good thing. ""Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too"" splits the difference between the two -- and again -- is really just a fun, crazy ride. The implications of digital consciousness is a topic they've been to before a few times, and is probably one of the best topics that they cover. tl;dr Black Mirror is at its best when it's not moralizing about the dangers of technology, and just tells stories in a familiar world but with occasional technological upgrades.

They did both. They used the dolls' voice model for Ashley Eternal's voice and extracted the lyrics for the unreleased songs from the real Ashley.
Among an ocean of trash productions, Black Mirror is still a breath of relatively fresh air.
I really liked Smithereens. It's not so much a morality play like some of Black Mirror as an exploration of what kinds of stories can now exist in our present time, IMO. It's partially a response to all the people who say ""90% of Seinfeld wouldn't happen with cell phones, let alone smartphones."" So what happens with smartphones? Well, one thing happens that couldn't really happen before: you can't ignore that power is no longer solely or even mostly held in the government. You can't write honest stories about today without turning @jack or Zuckerberg into power players. And where government is written on every piece of currency which you can barely go a day without addressing in some form, many people can barely go an hour without some form of influence from social media. @jack affects millions of people multiple times a day. Every minute he doesn't moderate his platform better, at least one person gets harassed, every day Twitter doesn't clean up its shit, someone gets more radicalized. And he can sit in his ivory tower, his silent retreats or whatever, and fret about how he doesn't have the authority to do anything, how he can't mitigate his business's addiction to becoming addictive, how he can't morally prevent harassment due to free speech concerns. But still, those millions of interactions a day, even if 99.9% of them just wash up like gentle waves on the shore, that last .1% can be tsunamis wrecking people's entire lives. A notification at the wrong time is, if anything, the most innocent problem. It's one that Apple has mostly solved for their customers with Do Not Disturb While Driving, even, and I'd be shocked if Google hasn't done similar by now. But people using the platform as intended, to get their message out? Even if that message is hateful? That's a real indictment of Twitter. I really wish that's what Smithereens was about. That's a conversation we need to have more.
I thought this season was actually a lot more focused than others since it had a more specific overarching theme based on the age old question of ""how to we connect with each other"". Although I do agree that the 2nd episode wasn't sharp enough and did too much to try and absolve their Zuckerburg analog of responsibility for what he created which ironically created some very unsettling and dissonant parallels with the real world given all the terrible things Zuckerberg and Facebook have done. The way that end scene was put together was amazing though. As for the other episodes, having endings that are bittersweet isn't a bad thing and isn't even unprecedented for the series. Overall very happy with the season.
Black Mirror was never a BBC programme. But I think perhaps in making it some kind of connected universe instead of just a plain anthology series, Brooker might have written himself into a corner. There is a timeline between episodes and over half of the episodes are about copying people's personalities somehow. Perhaps that doesn't help him to explore new themes.
I've watched a little over half the episodes from the first four seasons and finished watching the fifth season yesterday, though I watched them out-of-order. I actually liked all three episodes overall, even if I think the writing needs some help. Spoiler: show ""Smithereens"" was a bit scattered but Andrew Scott did such an excellent job with the lead character that he rescued a rather drab script. It was the first time I've seen Damson Idris and he also did a notable job bringing to life a character that just wasn't written very well. Those two helped move the episode along and although I'm not sure the episode had a single, well-defined point to make, it is an illustration of just how much data we willingly, and also unwittingly, share with social media and advertising companies and how those companies can build a surprisingly complete profile of their users. ""Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too"" started out rather unpromising as yet another coming of age story. Although I very early-on noticed that the chorus of the Ashley O song that was repeatedly played was extremely similar to that of Nine Inch Nails ""Head Like a Hole"" which piqued my curiosity. I was rewarded for my patience by seeing and hearing Hannah Montana Miley Cyrus swearing enough to make a sailor blush which I have to admit was quite entertaining. Not to mention seeing that she can actually act. I have some mixed feelings about ""Striking Vipers."" Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was a standout among the actors, along with Nicole Beharie. It's mostly a fairly straightforward, and familiar, story about the hazards of getting too attached to experiences in the online world. I have to credit the episode for injecting some nuance into ideas of sexual orientation and the boundaries of relationships, whether marriage or friendship. It feels somewhat appropriate that it was released near the beginning of Pride Month even if that was likely accidental.
Aww then we'd miss out on the immensely pleasing shots when they are practicing their fighting moves. They do some insane jump kick and the camera pans out to 'Mortal Kombat' camera mode. Every time they did it, I had a big smile on my face. Like mocap came full circle.
I disagree about Smithreens being the weakest. The other two were way to Millennial for me.
They should do an episode in which a society obsessed with a prestige dramatic television series descends into chaos when the show's eccentric producer releases a final season which is intentionally bad in order to make a point about the nature of fandom.
I liked this season OK, but like others I found it a bit lackluster compared with past efforts. ""Smithereens"" in particular had interesting potential but failed to deliver, imho. Spoiler: show Somewhat annoyingly, they tossed off one potentially great idea - that social media platforms actually strive for dopamine level targets during development - that just got thrown out as a one-line, yet could have been the basis for the entire episode, or perhaps another episode, akin to ""Terminal Man"" in some ways but on a societal scale. Unlike some, I thought the Miley Cyrus outing was the most compelling and entertaining, given recent troubling news related to Britney Spears' hangers-on, and stories about how K-Pop bands are being managed and manipulated by their corporate handlers. It had kind of a weird shift in tone about 2/3 of the way through, but I liked it. Also, as interesting as stories about AI and consciousness transfer are, the show feels like it's falling into a bit of a rut along these lines. Surely there are other aspects of modern technology worth exploration. Perhaps Brooker needs to allow some other writers a shot at episodes, along the lines of ""The Twilight Zone.""
with Fake News, AI, VR AR, Black Mirror is basically just a documentary a bit ahead of schedule
After watching the entire season this week, my overall reaction to all 3 episodes was: Sooooo slooooooooow. I was dying of boredom halfway through each episode and getting ready to finally say that enough was enough. And then I felt that only Striking Vipers and Ashely had any sort of payback for the effort of watching it all with twists that I didn't see coming. For me, Smithereens had zero payback. Tech company knows everything, resists doing the right thing (blocking access to owner), the owner feigns actual interest in helping out (continues retreat after fact), and in the end nothing changes. IMHO his was possibly the worst season of Black Mirror.
I’ll be the dissenting opinion and say that I never thought this show was all that great. It only has one truly good episode IMO and that’s the one where the sociopath guy traps digital clones of his coworkers in a Star Trek simulation so he can torture them. Most of the episodes are just too predictable and on the nose. There’s no subtlety. They just take some idea about the evils of technology and beat you over the head with it. I know people here love this show so I expect to get downvoted.
I thought the new season had already premiered on CNN and MSNBC.
As a biologist, I am definitely not irritated! Reminds me a bit of the gene regulation / chaos paper that came out a few months ago. The immune system might not be as complicated as the brain but in some ways I would argue it is close. On chaotic dynamics in transcription factors and the associated effects in differential gene regulation As a field I think we have a lot to learn from physics and math - these are exciting times.
Kind of reminds me of fly-by-wire systems (or if you're a table top RPG geek, reflex-by-wire augmentation), where, basically, the entire system is balanced in an stable semi-unstable state, and you just don't correct for whatever direction you want to go at any given moment. Not exactly the same (nor exactly the correct description of a fly-by-wire system), but it get's the point across. Basically, the brain is unstable enough that it can respond in the fastest/best way it can at any given moment by just not correcting the response and allowing a phase change. Probably evolved rather quickly, and early, given how widely it's spread around the species. Seems like it would be a major survival mechanism. Anything that speeds up responses to environment would be a major survival boost.
The entire article didn't even touch on wtf is a brain avalanche, how does the rice/brain analogy work, or at least focus on the brain part of this criticality theory. More than half the article talking about rice and sand, and I'm patiently waiting to see how this applies to the brain. Then they just brush it off lightly and end the article.. What..
Yeah, this article seemed to be sadly lacking in its explanation of what does it mean, and why does it matter, and how was it tested? It seems like it's just propagating a theory someone had that wasn't fully tested.
Yes, I'd very much like at least a description of what quantities are being plotted and are related to a critical exponent behavior.
Rant: In the title, either ""...Brain Operates..."" or ""...Brains Operate..."" /rant
Beware, your brain may no longer be the boss
Agreed. The words-to-point ratio was far too high
And here I thought it was fairly straightforward? A ""brain avalanche"" would be when we see a given set of stable neurons all switch to unstable (the avalanche) when pushed to the tipping point. I.e. a neuron is not firing in synchronization with other nearby neurons until the avalanche, wherein they all ""tumble down the sandhill,"" or all begin firing in unison. But that's what I picked up; I'm not an expert by any means.
I J Good, he of Bletchley Park fame, proposed ""partly baked ideas"" as a category. It isn't a theory because it doesn't seem to explain anything at the moment.
I wonder if this might help explain ""temporary insanity"" (the real issue, not the lawyer overused one) whereby the cascade causes us to do all manner of crazy and random things, until the cascade stops and we return to normal...
""tipping point"" or ""critical point"" or one of my faves, crux point.
Shouldn't have used the one in the jar with the name Abby Normal.
SMBC today
My guess is that the analogy with the sand pile is that firing neurons triggers other neurons, causing bursts of activity that are likened to the sand avalanches. It would certainly have been better if the article had explained this instead of leaving us guessing. I have more trouble figuring out what the analogy with phase transitions is about. Are they likening the transition from sleep to wakefulness to a transition from solid to liquid, or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4fU0Ajo4RM
The phases would be “uncoordinated firing” and “coordinated firing”.
Same thought I was left with. Was really expecting the last paragraph or two being what exactly is at tipping point. So many properties could be at tipping point. We're talking about a brain after all, an incredibly complex device. We have emergent properties that could be at tipping point like logic, encoding and decoding. We have physical properties that could change to influence what responses occur for which chemical interactions. Heat is a big deal with a brain, only takes a few degrees off the ideal temp to over heat or under heat after all. So many things it could mean...
So...our brains are full of rice? Or is it sand? Are the rats sand and humans rice?
You are tapioca.
If brains transitioning between conscious and unconscious states are experiencing a phase change of some kind, and brains need to hover in a state close to where this phase change occurs to function, would someone in a coma have a brain that is too far from the critical point to recover on its own? Furthermore, if so, could statistics like this help us diagnose the nature of the problem in hard-to-treat comatose patients and perhaps point the way to an effective therapy?
Negative. I am a meat popsicle.
Actually, I think this may tend to align to something I’ve been working on, and posted a tiny slice of here recently. While you are likely trolling, I’ll say the exact opposite is true with the your perception of brain activity. You’re seeing what I call “discrimination failure” - the amount and rate of information arriving simply overwhelms the brain’s ability to pick out what’s actually ‘important’ or ‘correct’ to process. We may well be at an inflection point for the species again. Those who are better suited to adaptation will become “homo criticalis” and everyone else will fade to black. This would tend to explain why Trump and Fox News even exist; too many people have lost the ability to understand shit from Shinola. (Sorry, caught the opening of The Jerk the other night) And this is not a political comment...the behavior extends to every facet of life and people of every stripe. Trump has a base of terrified, overwhelmed people who buy into MAGA because it promises a return to simpler times of black and white skin color, TV, and politics. They literally cannot think straight. Violence? Limbic system response loop. “SCARED...FIGHT...SOOTHING BRAIN CHEMICALS...BETTER” that is regressive behavior. It seems people behave like animals? They are. In my small circle of family and friends, I’ve been trying some “chaos counter programming” and it seems to help. I literally address it as CHAOS and defuse when possible. I do it at work as well. By that, when I realize someone is thrashing and overwhelmed, I pick the ONE DAMN THING for them, present it, and explain why that’s the choice. You’d think people would be pissed. And indeed, back in the 80’s, I was Sheldon Cooper and then some. Now, that (getting pissed and wanting to punch me) has become very rare. People seem relieved. Again, may explain Trump and Fox News; “Please tell me what to think, sir.” Anyway, the point is to cut people some slack as they may well not be able to help acting like a chimp. Or orangutan as it were.
Negative. I am a meat popsicle. /edit omg ninja'd by The Dark with the exact same joke. He is officially 9 minutes funnier than I am. I'm going to go rewatch The Fifth Element in penance and think about what I've done.
I wish the author addressed this - not sure how this passed the editors desk either. So would that single avalanche mean a single thought emerging or is it a single avalanche over an entire long period (like awake or asleep) or is wakefulness itself a string of avalanches interspaces with random fires?

Surprised at the bellyaching in the comments. The author has left some resources for further reading; at a minimum I plan to find the ""How Nature Works"" book. The article reports on an interesting paper and is not a deep dive into the subject itself (which appears to be rather abstruse). Thanks for piquing my interest and leaving some breadcrumbs to follow. And maybe I'm reading too much into this but it seems like a good reminder to get your sleep in!
Great article, thanks!
Welcome to Ars 2019. Where Dealmaster, entertainment news, and Wired reposts rule the day. In depth science comes last. It wasn't always this way.
I think the author did not address them because it's not in the published article. All your questions are probably good hypotheses but not in the scope of this study. This study looked at the change from sleep to wakefulness, and observed that it follows power laws and that a criticality occurs. However, we still don't know what class the phase change is, it appears to be something unknown. This is still a pretty awesome finding, to my uneducated mind; it suggests there's a physical phase transition between sleep and wakefulness (so maybe even consciousness?), like water and ice.
If you're going to write a general-consumption article on a topic, you typically need to include enough information that people actually understand what the heck you're talking about. Links to your sources aren't really enough, particularly when the topic is niche enough that those sources are likely impenetrable, too.
Five seconds of Googling got me this: Neuronal Avalanche It was also implicit (if not explicit) in the article that they were talking about a massive increase/decrease in neural activity states that takes place between the two phases, a sort of spike between resting states. A phase change in water maintains a fixed temperature until the phase state change is completed. In a brain, it's a transient, higher amount of neural activity before settling on a new level which may be higher or lower or the same. That spike is where the neural avalanche begins and once the new equilibrium is achieved, it ends. It doesn't just happen between waking and sleeping, though. The rice analogy means there's usually small amounts of activity and then a very large amount of activity. Sand, rice, all of that can be put on to a pile slowly and the pile will build up, then suddenly the whole pile collapses. The building up part is the resting or slow phase. The pile collapsing is the active or avalanche phase. The analogy shows that activity is always going on, but it's not ""steady"". It happens in pulses that alternate between slow and fast, with the fast pulses being of shorter duration with higher activity than the slow pulses.

I 'm a (slightly irritated) biologist with an educated interest in neurosciences, so I may help a bit. ""What avalances?"" - Avalances of electric spikes. Typically, the awaken brain has a very different signal distribution than the sleeping one. When we 're awake, the signal distribution seems almost random. You have flashlights all over the place, cause subsequent parts of the brain react to very different signals; smells, optical stimuli, sounds, thoughts etc. Interestingly, that's not the picture whan we 're in deep sleep. In particular, ""NREM stage 3"" sleep is characterized by accute neural synchronization. The neurons seem to ""sing together"" for some minutes and it's at exactly at this point that our day impressions (cache) become ""permanent"" memories (saving in a HD). I strongly suggest you get ""Why We Sleep"". Ars had an interview with the author a few months ago. Everything you need to know about this particular function of the brain is in there. It will also change your life for the better- trust me on this. ""What does near criticality has to do with anything"". The article is about the transition from the seemingly random flashing to synchronization. What do we see during the transition? Is there something like, say, Normal Distribution of flashes? The authors of the article suggest that the diagrams point to something like the Power Law. There are ""avalances"" of flashes during the transitional phase and their (fractal - like) distribution suggests chaos. Why the (mild) irritation? Simply cause the brain is much more than the cortex. Also, I 'd like to see results from bird's brains.
If so, then rats, which also exhibit self-organized criticality, would also be spiritual*. It's not their fault that the human researchers were unaware that humans were actually just the third most intelligent animal on the planet, and not, as is popularly assumed, the second. * And so would piles of sand, the stock market, and neural networks. Have you heard the RSS of our Lord and Savior, Skynet?
I seem to recall that neurons have typically many dendrite synapses (inputs) but a single output (axon) which, however, can terminate on more than one dendrite. Some of the inputs are positive and some are negative, so at any time the neuron may be static or firing at a different rate based on the excess of positive over negative. Thus the neuron is, unlike a logic gate, very complex and somewhat dynamic. If the article is suggesting that the typical neuron at rest is close to firing, that makes sense. You would want the best balance of sensitivity over false positives.
Neurons at rest are well known to be ""near"" firing, for some value of near. This is supposed to be about bulk properties, or according to what's-his-face, the same property applying to many scales of the brain.
If you can find scientific proof linking your currently unfounded speculation to the spiritual, then that's science. Trying to shoehorn in spiritual without supporting evidence isn't science. What's far more likely is, if such a correlation existed, that we perceive a physical phenomenon that is an aspect of how the universe is put together, which would naturally arise simply because of the physics and chemistry involved as something other than what it is and interpret a common natural, science-based phenomenon as something that doesn't actually exist. The problem with spirituality and religion in general is that it isn't willing to accept alternative conclusions. It is a conclusion in and of itself with cherry-picked facts taken out of context to ""prove"" its existence in a never-ending game of moving goalposts. Soft-sell it if you must, at least you weren't hard core. But you went completely off the reservation with that thought. The essence of spirituality and religion is ""faith"", which is to say, if you can prove it, it's not being faithful. It's an inherent contradiction of religion. If, as when I was told at the age of six just before I got kicked out of Sunday School for pointing out the contradictions, gods rely on the faith of their flock for existence, if you remove the faith with certainty, their existence ends. This argues that the uncertainty involved is what drives compliance to a religious doctrine because the flip side is always ""eternal torment"" or some other horrific thing. The lies religion tells perpetuates that uncertainty. OTOH, if you can prove that this is ""spiritual"" you kill religion, so I would greatly encourage you to provide real, scientific proof of the existence of spirituality that isn't relying entirely on anecdotal evidence.

So...Pitt's deceased-in-action astronaut father is Tommy Lee Jones? Stealth ""Space Cowboys"" sequel?
Some interesting tidbits, but it looks like a sort of high minded... but kinda standard space action / chase film. Personally I hope it is more than that, but nothing wrong with some space action.
And Armageddon, she left Ben Affleck for another astronaut
Realistic space travel movie: Anyone that's missing is dead. Period.
It'll be interesting to see what sort of pseudoscientific McGuffin they come up with to explain the substance that can end all life on the planet.
Did anyone thought of looking for him on the moon?
The omega molecule...
""We need to kill this guy we sent out sixteen years ago before he kills the whole planet. We need somebody dedicated to the mission with perfect resolve."" ""Lets send his son!""
Given the choice, wouldn’t we all?
In other words, the same canned tag-line that's been used by nearly every space-related sci-fi movie after 2001: A Space Odyssey. You'd think they'd at least change the words around more.
*that's what captain Kirk said*
we want to do an absolutely realistic space movie - I know, let's have a car chase on moon.......
""he wanted to make a film that depicted space travel as realistically as possible "". Then he gets the rocket motor exhaust plume completely wrong AND had dust billowing on the Moon (dust doesn't billow or settle in a vacuum). Apart from that, it looks like a great,original masterpiece.... /s (shouldn't be necessary, but just in case)
It looks like they're in the midst of building a space elevator to me.
""But I can't shake a nagging feeling that I've seen this exact film several times before..."" Oh shut up! I'll take all the quality Hollywood scifi I can get, even if it is the same 3-4 plots recycled over and over.
Yeah, that's not an entirely unsympathetic life choice.
Judging by the trailer, Interstellar looks more realistic.
Gravity Spikes. (I enjoyed Wandering Earth despite that.)
That seems to be their plan. Well, they've got you. How much is a ticket these days?
Out of all the qualified people, they gotta send his son. I hope they have a plausible reason. It must be a doozy. ( Pictures of frisky behavior with farm animals?) Last edited by daveishere on Wed Jun 05, 2019 3:46 pm
That proves it's fiction.
Remember, there's an entire generation of kids out there who don't GAF who Brad Pitt is and haven't seen the 8 or so other movies that this movie steals all its plot-points from....... For the rest of us, it's time to re-watch Interstellar.
And what's with the space elevator being built out of stacked space station parts?
I'm willing to give this production a shot, but I think there's a solid chance that the above snarky comments are more entertaining than the movie will be.
That was my first thought. The fate of the planet rests on a single mission that involves the psychologically challenging role of traveling into deep space and then potentially killing off a bunch of fellow astronauts, so you pick the son of the commander to do it. What could possibly go wrong?
Translation: ""My God. It's full of Stars!!!""
Speaking with true humility, I think that chance is solid.
That's Adamantium son...
Minecraft brick-jumping.
Do you have a living will?
Billow no, but settle yes, right? There's still gravity on the moon.
The trailer caught my attention, then ... a space chase, presumably on the moon? Ummm, ok. I guess I haven't seen that before. Not sure that squares with ""the most realistic depiction of space travel,"" though.
""...quality Hollywood scifi..."". Now THAT is a small, lonely club.
Would you consider 1.62 m/sec^2 settling? Dust would fall at the same rate you would.
The overly mcguffinish plot plus the obvious stupidity of sending a criminal's son against him completely ruins it for me, regardless of how realistic the space travel is supposed to be. Having a coherent, relatable plot is way more important than getting the technical details right.
Fair enough.
Do they nuke the moon? It looks like maybe they nuke the moon.
Star Wars was great because it had great special effects(for it's time) with *terrific characters* if a reused plot. Gravity was a loser because it was set in *these times* where the disaster couldn't happen the way it was presented. Dune was a mess, and from what I hear Avatar had weak, if any, plot.

> Developed by Battlestar Galactica creator Ronald D. Moore Well, that show started out pretty cool but went downhill rapidly after the first couple seasons, and general consensus is that it ended up a total mess. (I can't speak to that last part from personal experience; I stopped watching somewhere around the point where the show began to literally portray suicide bombers as sympathetic characters! But people with stronger stomachs than mine seem to generally agree that it got worse rather than better.) So... I think I'll pass on this one.
I recommend the fake documentary Pervye na Lune (First on the Moon) in which the Soviets land a man on the Moon in the 1930s. Lost footage, stretching the history, exploring the edges of the plausible. And the fake news campaign as a part of making the movie. It’s briliant.
Space show fans might want to check out the anime Space Brothers, which follows two brothers and their dream (and reality) of becoming astronauts at JAXA (basically the Japanese NASA). I think it's pretty great, but I'm only a mild space nerd. I don't know if they messed up any important details or anything. It ran 99 episodes, and, unfortunately, ends without really ending. There's a manga (of course), but I haven't read it.
I thought the Love, death, and robots episode that included multiple takes on alternate history moon landings set a pretty high bar that this will take a lot more time not to beat.

I remember watching the extended-length pilot as a standalone and I was blown away. After season 1 it went all downhill for me and I stopped watching soon afterwards. But the set up was very good.
On the bright.....side...nits picking apart.... This show will look good as it was created on the new Mac Pro & new Nano XDR Display
Interesting; Stephen Baxter-ish territory, although I don't need another subscription service.
After the last episode of Battlestar Galactica, and then, somewhat gunshy, Caprica, I can literally no longer say the name ""Ronald D. Moore"" without preceding it with epithets. Last edited by Studbolt on Mon Jun 03, 2019 3:39 pm
Noticed the alternate reality trope right away, but you have got to wonder how radically everything else gets altered. Do you just change the Space Race part of reality, or does it affect everything else? Nixon is president in 1969, so does he lose in 1972 because the Soviets land first? Does Watergate happen? What happens with the Yom Kippor War if the Soviets are too busy racing to the Moon? Oh, I could go on and on, but I'll stop now.
So is it set in the 60s/70s? Or just using ""historical footage"" to set up the universe? I would think 50 years post divergence would be more interesting than 5-10.
laudunum wrote: It's 2019: ""For All Humankind."" It's an alternate history show set in 1969, and the title is based on the message on the plaque the Apollo 11 crew left on the moon, which itself is based on the the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_pla ... s_deployed Quote: Apollo 11 plaque inscription: ""Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind"" in capital letters. The statement ""We came in peace for all mankind"" is derived from the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act's declaration of policy and purpose: ""The Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind
So say we all.
There was a huge writers strike during the last few seasons so I'm not sure I blame him for that one. I do blame him for the Bionic Woman reboot though.
In an alternate reality where the USSR got a man to the moon first, I'd be entirely distracted thinking about how that actually happened. Like, what exactly was going on in '65-'69 in each country. Did the soviets get there on the N-1? Did they use a variation of the relatively low thrust but high efficiency NK-15/33? How were they able to make a rocket with ~40 engines across all stages reliable with '60's tech? Last edited by adgriff2 on Mon Jun 03, 2019 3:49 pm
seems a really nerdy idea, show what would happen if America kept up interest in space?
The writer's strike didn't last that long, it was only a few months and only affected season 4 of the show. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%8 ... ica_strike https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(season_4)#Production
Random question here. Is it possible to watch Apple TV without an Apple TV set top box? I have a media PC with Blu-Ray drive so I can run everything on a single box. If I buy stuff for Apple TV on my iPhone is there a website to login for Apple TV to view from Windows?
Glen Larson would like a word....
Its pretty hard to get there in 1969 without major divergences. Some possibilities off the top of my head The Soviets fund the programme sufficiently, which they never did. Maybe Korolev doesn't die in 1966, and can drive the programme more effectively. Maybe Korolev and Glushko don't hate each others' guts, so the N1 gets fewer, but more powerful engines. Or maybe the N1 is never selected at all, and a plan involving several Proton launches and LEO assembling is chose.
Watched every episode. Thought it was pretty good. It was a soap opera that just happened to be set in space. Mostly character-driven, high-minded, thought-provoking storylines. That's where they lost a lot of the current generation of science fiction fans.
Moore is also show-runner for Outlander, which is still going strong (although he does have the advantage of source material to work from). BSG did turn into a mess, but he was breaking new ground in terms of serialized storytelling, and had to deal with a lot of executive meddling from the network. He had minimal involvement with Caprica beyond setting and the pilot.
J. Michael Stracynzski would like to have a word.
Actually, this idea is not too far fetched. There was a path for the Soviets to beat the U.S. astronauts to the Moon if it were not for a major blunder on the part of Korolov. His decision to follow von Braun's lead and build a gigantic series-stage Moon rocket equivalent to the Saturn 5, the ill-fated N-1, was a big mistake. The Soviet lack both of hydrolox engine technology as embodied in the Rocketdyne J-2 and in an equivalent to the gigantic Rocketdyne kerolox F-1 doomed the N-1 (four launches, four failures, end of story). It's easy to show that Korolov could have scaled up his R-7/Soyuz launch vehicle to a capability to launch the 209,000 lb L-3 manned lunar spacecraft payload to low lunar orbit. From there one of the two cosmonauts aboard could have attempted a landing on the lunar surface. The over one year delay due to the disastrous Apollo 1 fire would have opened the window of opportunity for an attempted manned lunar landing in early/mid 1968, a year or more before Apollo 11. Korolov had the necessary kerolox engine technology in the NK-15 and NK-21 to power a Super R-7 to the Moon. He needed four kerolox side boosters each with 4 NK-15s straped on to a single kerolox core booster with 6 NK-15s, and topped off with a kerolox upper stage with 4 NK-21s. The gross liftoff weight (GLOW) would be about 6.1 million pounds. The great advantage of the Super R-7 is that Korolov could have ground-tested all of stages using a test facility capable of handling only 2 million pounds of thrust instead of having to build a gigantic ground test facility sized to handle the 8-9 million pounds of thrust from the 30 engines in the N-1 first stage. It was the lack of ground testing for the N-1 first stage that was the direct cause of the failure of Korolov's Moon rocket. These problems could have been solved quickly via ground testing if Korolov would have selected the Super R-7 option. Von Braun had the capability to ground-test all of the Saturn V stages with all engines running full power and that was the factor most responsible for the success of the Apollo program. Of course, there were other factors that caused trouble for the Soviet moon program. Most notably was the bitter professional rivalries between Korolov, Chelomei (chief designer of the Proton launch vehicle) and Yangel. And meddling by Khrushchev and Brezhnev in the Soviet effort made the Apollo program look like a model of management excellence. And Korolev has his place in history despite the N-1 fiasco. His R-7 lives on in the current Soyuz launch vehicle, which for the past 8 years has been the only way to send and return crew from the ISS. As for von Braun, his Saturn V turned out to be a dead end. The final two Saturn V's are in the museums. There are no legacy von Braun launch vehicles flying today.
I would recommend checking out Planetes a 26-episode anime television that revolves around the crew of the debris collection craft, Toy Box, in the year 2075.
And David Chase for the Sopranos, and a handful of others, but BSG (along with Lost) is the show that really opened the floodgates for serialized, open-ended TV for the masses. Luckily, most of the shows that came after learned from the mistakes that Moore and Abrams made.

The problem with BSG is that the ending was stupid, they had no plan, and they just made stuff up. There was not even a rough outline as to what was going to happen, which is why the ending was total nonsense. I'm sorry, but if you are doing a serial drama and you don't know where it is going, you suck at serial daramas and should stop doing them. That isn't to say that you can't change mid course due to new information, but you should at least have an outline about where you are going. BSG didn't know what the ending was going to be until they reached shoulder deep up their own ass and pulled it out. Remember, the end to BSG is that these humans that have been at each other's throats the entire series, collectively and without violence or argument decided to give up absolutely all of their technology, disperse away from each other, become hunter gathers, and go fuck and breed with the local hide wearing primitives... who they were genetically (and apparently culturally) compatible with. It was stupid. It was stupid because they had no plan, painted themselves into a corner, and just had to rip something out of their own butts. It sucked. BSG has its virtues, but long term planning and general story cohesiveness were not one of them.
Maybe, or not. Maybe they lost them when it quit being Battlestar Galactica and became ""guess who is going to turn out to be a Cylon this week!"". That is when I bailed on it, although a few people have said it improved later.
It is a very interesting premise: if the Soviets had gotten to the Moon first... then the Americans would have tried to get to Mars first, so we would have gotten to Mars by 1980 or thereabouts as people were expecting back then. But in that reality, would India have decided to align itself with the Communists?
It’s not too hard to think about what the American response will be in the movie if the plot is guided by history. All the following were USSR firsts in the space race: 1. First satellite to orbit Earth (Sputnik) 2. First animals to orbit Earth (dogs) 3. First to land a probe on the Moon 4. First man in space 5. First woman in space 6. First spacewalk 7. First lunar rover which ran around on the surface for a year 1970 -71 taking pics and analyzing the surface soil
Holy shit. SIGN ME THE FUCK UP WOOOOOOOO HYPE ROCKET BLAST OFF
The difference would have had to have been much earlier and much deeper... Perhaps the Soviets got Von Bron, and the US got the lesser scientists... Perhaps the Soviets got out of WW2 in a slightly better spot somehow that allowed them to succeed...
The documentary by the same name done by Al Reinert is brilliant. Quite different from the ""larger than mankind"" Apollo 11 film that just came out (which is also brilliant for some of the same reasons, that 65mm footage awesome), it merges all the lunar missions into one and is narrated by the Astronauts, giving the program a very human scale. Get the Criterion Blu-ray disc, much recommended.
Will this animated series be aimed at adults or teenagers/children? I think the answer to this will determine my level of interest.
Meh. It'll focus on the gatewatch planeswalkers like everything else story related MtG these days. I have zero interest in Chandra, Jace etc. and I'm a bit sick of seeing 30 cards a set with their bloody names and faces.
I remember reading a couple of the MTG-based novels and loved how I coincidentally had some cards that seem to have been described within. Given the dizzying spread of MTG editions and their stories (many interlinked) it's probably for the best that this movie intends to make one of its own rather than trying to fit into something already established.
If this series just draws from MTG lore and is about the Planeswalkers and their battles, summoning critters and casting spells, that could be neat as long as no cards are actually involved. If this is about some kids tossing out cards to ""battle"" a'la Yugioh, Digimon, or basically Pokemon.. that'll be a hard pass. Last edited by Kilbane on Mon Jun 03, 2019 10:49 am
It's awesome to see how nerds have conquered Hollywood. To think that Thanos, Groot and Wakanda are now part of today's vernacular is incredible. Someone do MechWarrior next!

I would prefer a WH40K scifi series.
My feeling is it won't be Game of Thrones adult, but it won't be aimed at kids *per se*. I don't think WotC would license MA++, but adult level without nudity but with adult themes seems most likely to me. Magic isn't really a kids game - some kids may play it, but it's *primarily* an adult game, and this sort of thing *has* to appeal to 20-somethings all the way up to 40-somethings who grew up playing it in their teenage years.
Seriously, this. HBO or Amazon could easily get a GOT-esque series out of MW.
Personally, I may enjoy it either way. There are many movies that are targeted towards teenagers or children that I enjoy a lot, for example the recent 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs', 'How to Train Your Dragon', etc. It feels nice to let go of heavier, more adult-themed topics and just feel like a kid again, if for no other reason than to escape from the more sobering reality that exists outside of the [home]theater walls. edit: mah grammars is bad
""Endgame"" is one word in the movie title, not two.
They are. https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/17/1814 ... ted-series
I know animation is signifcantly cheaper... but a live action production on the scale of GoT would be my dream.
In the book I remember most recently reading, the description was somewhat like this: ""Lands"" that the wizard taps for mana, are the actual physical mana-rich locations he or she has traveled to in the past, and established a kind of metaphysical bond with that allows them to draw on their power from afar. No cards for summoning, but ""mementos"" of beings/creatures the wizard had met amd bonded with before - an ice-cold crystal, a gnarled root - stored in a pouch that helped the wizard to focus their mind outward to where the being(s) reside so that the wizard can ""summon"" them to their current location. (That is, if they have enough power/persuasive ability to go ""Hey ice wind monster thing, how's it goin? Remember we're friends and all? If you come with me, you can play freeze-the-codpiece with this nasty armor guy!"" An element of danger in that, as if a wizard's concentration is broken while their mind is (literally) elsewhere during summoning, their mind isn't likely to come back. Artifacts in that book were dragged around in a caravan wagon, for the most part.

I remember reading(and loving) the first MTG book(Arena) written by Forstchen, I think something along those veins would work well, but that's just my opinion.
Needs moar Slivers.
Yeah, but you have to admit the new Liliana is both very pretty, and very awesome.
I'm still a fan of Nicol Bolas.
I wonder which MtG they're adapting. There are entire book series about the game that reference stuff that either doesn't matter, never happened, happened in some alternate reality, or simply went out of print. The Arena series for example posited a version of mana that would have been right at home in the Runelords books.
Yeah, the new Bolas is sweet. I'm liking the Bolas Citadel card in Golgari . https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1934573#online
""Too old, thank god."" I'll change up my favorite Gone in 60 seconds line (was ""too young, thank god""). I stopped with MtG shortly after Ice Age. So like back about 20 years ago. Jesus, I can't believe it has been that long now. I've played a bit over the years, but only with oldsters like me with the older sets. Little interest in picking up any of the 20 odd newer expansions and main line series. Anyway, it dates me and isn't the best writing ever, but the MtG book Arena (came with two free cards!) was actually pretty good IMHO and would make a reasonably good movie or short series IMHO if adapted to the screen.
Early MTG? Sure. Later-era MTG started to figure out what the multiverse was about and managed to create its own interesting and occasionally unique lore across various worlds. I mean, we're not talking high art or anything, but it's at least D&D levels of decent.
Yeah no. Not in (current year meme). The Imperium isn't the ""good guys"" anymore than chaos, or the ""weaboo space commies"". Edit: How could I forget about the orkZ? (it's with a Z ya gits!) I'd be really worried about how such a pervasive issue in the universe would be treated would they be laughable but still crazy dangerous boyZ from the older and non 30k lore or would we see ""they're actually the biggest threat giez!"" Stuff from war in the beast?(Kr'Orkz) Though seeing a psyker have their powers backfire in a pilot would REALLY be a great way to set the tone if they tried.

I think MtG has always been geared at teens to adults, but the game mechanics (at least circa 20-25 years ago when I was playing and collecting actively) weren't too complex for a nerdy tween to pick up easily. I remember playing in tournaments when I was 12 and 13 kicking adults buts with my decks and game play. That said, I don't think I ever advanced past about round 4 of a tournament at my local mall. I think the best I managed was making it in to the final 8 and got crushed. Usually they were around 40-60 person tournaments, double elimination and then the top 8 would play single elimination. If my memory is working right it was usually about 25% under 16, 50% 16-22 year olds and about 25% adults. */s/ in case it wasn't clear. I really just wanted to make the joke.
Will Bitcoin be a part of this movie? /s Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, or MtGOX, was famously the first major exchange where people could trade bitcoins for real money. It started out as a place to trade the cards online. Last edited by danielravennest on Mon Jun 03, 2019 12:25 pm
Playing since 97. Its Brother's War or gtfoh.

Did someone shit in your cheerios this morning? There are plot holes big enough fly a 747 through in pretty much every major fantasy/si-ci movie/franchise. Doesn't mean that they suck.
20? lol. The 74th expansion since Ice Age released two months ago. Not counting spinoff sets or core sets. Also, they are really stretching for set names now. The latest is called ""War of the Spark"".
I like a lot of the cards in the new set, but I'm not digging the new ""amass"" mechanic.
Quote: Our goal is to not only tell a compelling story leveraging Magic: The Gathering’s incredible body of work, but to also push the medium and perception of storytelling through animation,” Octopie CEO Isaac Krauss told the site. Well, at least they're planning to start off small. I just checked their Squarespace site: Quote: OCTOPIE IS THE CUTTING EDGE ANIMATION NETWORK AND STUDIO THAT IS RESHAPING THE DIGITAL LANDSCAPE BY EMPOWERING AND INVESTING IN THE NEW GENERATION OF CONTENT CREATORS. With over 40 years of animation development and production experience, Octopie is an industry leader in cultivating, producing and programming original animation. Yep, still humble and modest. Quote: Having worked with visionary creators including Robert Rodriguez and the Russo Brothers, Octopie’s content can be seen globally across both broadcast television and digital platforms. So what have they worked on? Their Squarespace site lists...nothing. That's quite impressive. ... So, I wasted a lot of time hunting and came up with nothing. I guess the Monty Python line, ""They've been in the business now ten years, nine as other groups"" applies here.
It will likely be aimed at those who are currently in the fan base of the game, which is to say that it will be a PG-13 movie that tries to satisfy both children and adults without leaning too heavily towards either side.
I just want to see Chandra turn an actual mountain sideways to draw its power.
We call that shard volley.
The use of Chandra in the teaser image implies it's going to be focused on Gatewatch characters, or at least this era of Magic story. There is that big story arc that started with Magic Origins and just wrapped up in War of the Spark, which seems about the right length for a TV series. The Russos seem like very good people to adapt that storyline. WotC pretty openly took inspiration from comic book superhero storytelling for that arc, and the nature of the game leads to the story having lots and lots of characters, both things the Russos have proven capable of handling well. Or potentially they could do something else. There's going to be a new story arc starting up soon, or they could just write whole new material using existing characters. Or maybe Chandra's just misdirection and it will focus on an earlier storyline (Weatherlight saga?) or an entirely new set of characters.
Kinda looks like a busted Tesseract. Thank heavens.
Well you learn something new everyday?
fuck, they found the Allspark. now they'll stop at nothing to revive Megatron.
Hey, I got my bachelor's in Materials Science and Engineering! Not a degree you see get mentioned too often.
I'm not surprised the scientist doesn't go into details in a short interview. But Ars probably could have also added the detail that U is an alpha emitter (which doesn't penetrate).
Reminds me of when Discovery channel went from focusing on science to topics such as ""Lost Nazi megaconstructions"".
The German configuration is bizarre to me. We now know that the geometric configuration of emitters, moderators, and reflectors is very important. Surely that must have been known, or at least suspected, at the time? Why use an arrangement in which the cubes' rotational arrangement is essentially uncontrolled?
Honestly, I wonder a bit about the Discovery and History channels change in focus from, well, science and history to fantasy and conspiracy theory. Is it a cause or an effect of the seeming lack of education among Americans?
Safety instructions for handling alpha emitters: Do Not Eat.
Probably it seemed like a good idea at that time.
Perhaps the classical German engineering mindset took over: why use a simple, durable, inexpensive arrangement (a stack of blocks) when you can use a complex, fragile, difficult-to-fabricate arrangement (a wire-wound string)?
I have a couple theories (I am an engineer, non-nuclear). Since they had a limited amount of the material, they may not have had many options to change its shape. Machining it into cylinders or spheres would have wasted precious material. Shape may not be as important in the sort of basic, primitive reactor the Germans were aiming for. I.e. with X amount of uranium, we get Y amount of energy, therefore factors A and B in our BombenFormel must be C and D. Compare to when you are trying to make a very specific implosion to make an H bomb, and you are dealing with an entirely different level of precision than ""poke it with a stick and see how far it moves"". Sometimes when you are stuck with the previous two limitations, you become fixated on something because it is pretty.
Some of the German physicists sabotaged the program from within - concealing the existence of an alternative to U-235 (Pu-239), miscalculating reactor scaling extrapolation to criticality, fudging absorption cross sections of potential moderators etc to stall progress.

Programming to the lowest common denominator. All TV channels are ""ratings-driven"" (yes, even PBS) so to increase ratings, you must decrease the writing/story level to that of the lowest common denominator audience. In the case of the US, that means; Programming written and aimed at an audience with no more than a 6th-grade understanding level. This is also why most national news programming has devolved into ""Info-Tainment"" with 23 minutes of ""fluff"" and ""celebrity news"" and no more than 7 minutes of actual NEWS. When you target the WWE audience, you can't put on programing written for people with B.S. degrees. BTW: Politics works that same way.
Do Not Eat, Inhale, or Inject
I learned that in school at the age of about 17. In those days nuclear power was the future and the school science syllabus heavily biased towards radiation and uranium chemistry. I'm still alive to prove how dangerous most radioactives aren't.
A reactor is only part way to a bomb...... Where on Earth would have the Germans gotten the resources to refine enough uranium at that stage in the game ??????? They didn't even get close to a bomb...
and the people who demanded ""a la carte"" cable channel selection didn't realize that could make things worse. Bundling channels into packages means you can ""bury"" the costs of lower-appeal channels.
>>Germany's secretive, isolationist approach actually hampered their nuclear program...<< This was not unique to their nuclear program. Even before the actual war, many ""departments"" of the German war machine sought Hitler's favour for their ideas, schemes and plans, quite often competing with each other for resources. As the war stopping going their way, this only became more intense, as Hitler's love of ""wonder weapons"" intensified and crackpots began to emerge, stealing away critical resources from proven armaments, in favour of pie-in-the-sky ideas that could never work. Fortunately for all of us, Hitler allowed this to occur.
Did anyone else notice the uranium glass (vaseline glass) behind them? I have a collection as big as that and always wondered how safe it was. Dr. Google says it's fine because the amount of radiation is lower than background radiation. Plus it's alpha radiation anyway - as was mentioned earlier. I guess if it's safe enough for a nuclear physicist, it's safe enough for me. But I still don't handle it often.
It’s also interesting to note that the Japanese had two atomic bomb R&D centers during the war. This information was suppressed after the war for a long time for political purposes. But a while ago, I really don’t remember when it was, Scientific American had a very good, fairly detailed article about them. And of course, we all know about the German sub that was sunk bringing atomic materials to the Japanese near the end of the war.
That extra arm comes in handy too.
If they had had twice as many cubes available what would that get them? It's maybe part of a nuclear power plant, but it's not a bomb, and I'm not sure how it gets them one. Last edited by ZenBeam on Mon Jun 03, 2019 8:36 am
Anyone interested in this topic should read The Making of the Atomic Bomb. Almost every part of the story is in that book. It is a fabulous achievement. I would add that several books on The Uranium Club, the German nuclear scientist who were bugged while imprisoned at Farm Hall for a few months after the war, is a must read. I was an US enlisted man in the early 1960s. At the USAFE library in Germany, I discovered a book of transcripts from those very secret Farm Hall recordings. It was a bound volume, but the jacket was hand lettered, not printed. Strange. I knew it was a gold mine of information that the public did not have...and I had no idea why it was in that particular library. I quietly returned to the library for a few hours each day until I had read it fully. My conclusions are only slightly different from what other historians have subsequently written after the transcripts were released: 1. The Germans were far, far from a concept for a sustainable reaction. 2. The aggressive attempts by the Allies to destroy the Norsk Hydro plant had played a role in convincing the Germans that heavy water was critical to their research. 3. They seemed to believe that any possible weapon would be a nuclear pile of some considerable size, so large it would have to be carried in a ship. In an enemy harbor, the ship-born reactor would be allowed to go critical, creating an explosion but also a radiation mess that made the harbor unusable for a very long time. 4. When told that the Americans has exploded a bomb at Hiroshima, they assumed it had been delivered by ship. 5. When told a few days later that the American bombs had been delivered by aircraft, they were truly dumbfounded. 6. When told a few days later that a material called U-239 had been used, Heisenberg went to a blackboard and explained to the rest of the group how a bomb might be made IF such a material could be created. His explanation was quite good and was cited as proof of 7. 7. Very quickly, the Germans fabricated the story that they so feared the implications of a nuclear weapon unleashed on the world that they betrayed Hitler by claiming that a nuclear bomb was not possible. 8. They also implied by implication that America's nuclear team had betrayed science by creating a horrible weapon, a sin they would never have committed. The world never bought their story....and when the Farm Hall transcripts were released, we saw their fraud.
The Japanese had an active program with a large cyclotron measuring nuclear cross sections and synthesizing isotopes. IIRC a Japanese physicist was the first to suggest a fission explosion might be used to initiate fusion of deuterium. Luckily for the allies the effort was severely hampered by lack of resources and access to uranium later in the war.
people used to eat off of this: (the red glaze was made from UO3) link
""My parents will tell you they tried taking me to Toys R Us at age four and I just cried until we went to Radio Shack"" I know that feeling.....I still miss RadioShack...
I get that. My question is more about what started the vicious cycle. Did dumb content create, or merely respond to the change? Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Maybe more importantly, was there a tipping point or game changer that started the downward slope?
I remember when we used to jokingly call History ""The Hitler Channel.""
Most metal bead curtains ever.
The Japanese Army's uranium enrichment facility (which used thermal diffusion) was destroyed by the American firebombing campaign in March 1945; they were getting very little enriched uranium and were also hampered by an insistence on using light water. The Navy never built their enrichment facility (which would have used centrifugal diffusion). They had access to heavy water from ammonia plants in Korea, but only a few grams per month. I'm not sure if he discussed fusion, but Hikosaka Tadayoshi mentioned the use of nuclear energy for both power generation and weapons use in 1934.
Hail Hydra
Heisenberg was breaking bad.
Similar to how captured Wehrmacht Generals told the the Allies how they could have beaten the Russians if only Hitler had given them permission to use the strategies they wanted.
I think that you are certainly right that there was a worry about wasting their very limited supply of uranium; however, another consideration was likely that they would also have been wary about constructing larger volumes of fissionable uranium as their knowledge about achieving (and predicting) criticality was obviously not very well tested. Now I'm not sure if these uranium cubes from the German reactor were enriched or not (EDIT - it most surely was not, illustrated by the hilarious and terrifying photo of soldiers unknowingly stacking a huge pile of cubes); however, enriched uranium can be fairly dangerous to handle, even in small quantities, thanks to its ability to reach criticality in small quantities when surrounded by a neutron moderator... like water. Richard Feynman was actually involved in developing guidelines for handling enriched uranium after seeing how carelessly it was being handled in Manhattan Project processing plants. http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/06/ ... -the-bomb/ Machining cubes and having a ""scalable"" reactor design (add more cubes, change the cube density, or change the reflector/moderators) is then understandable if you are trying to cautiously approach achieving criticality. Even after the first atomic bombs were detonated, Manhattan Project physicists were still conducting (rather dangerous) criticality experiments to refine their understanding and models. Using 1 of 3 original plutonium cores fabricated, physicists conducted experiments later referred to as ""Tickling the Dragons Tail"" by bringing two hemispheres of a plutonium core together and measuring power output with different tamper (aka neutron reflector) materials. These experiments were conducted in a very... manual... way, prone to human error. In two SEPARATE instances, the physicists' hands slipped, resulting in a surge in output of the core. In both cases, the physicists died agonizing deaths of the radiation exposure they received. After the 2nd accident, they still did not discontinue experiments, but they did transition to robotic control and with approximately a km separating the humans from the core.

Dude really likes Uranium. Has a whole Vaseline glass collection under black light and people hunt down things like Nazi Uranium Cubes to give him as gifts.
'Every bit as entertaining' presumably...
...as hell, oh, oh , OH! lol, rimshot.
I am a huge fan of the book and am loving the adaptation so far. I had the exact same thought while watching the first two episodes - this is a labor of love, and boy does it show. I have been thrilled by how many details from the book have made it into the series. Bummer about the bikers, though. Now to see if I can convince my wife to read the book after watching the series... Edit: I am also appreciating the subtle changes to make the story and setting period-appropriate for 2019. ""Mobile phone network"", etc.
Wasn't he an atheist? I mean sure, that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't believe in an afterlife, but...it's pretty likely.
It really is one of the best adaptations of a book I have ever seen. Naturally a few things had to be changed for the medium, but Gaiman did a wonderful job keeping it as close as possible & adding only a little bit to flesh out some moments. The little easter egg tributes to his & Terry's favorite media were nice touches. In fact, my only real complaint is that they never did explain the Queen gag, which is one of my favorite jokes in the book. However, they did keep what I believe is the best line in literary history:
So I'm really conflicted. On one hand, this sounds really great. I haven't subscribed to Amazon for a while, as the selection is abysmal where I live, but could do it for a bit to see this. On the other, according to the author ""Rim of the World"" was awesome...
I can't remember how many times I've read that book over the years, it's my favorite by far. So far 2 eps in I'm very happy with how it's going, though the nuns could have done with a bit more chattering... Looking forward to rest of it which me and the wife will probably finish up today! So much fun!!
Is there a way to legally watch this without having to purchase a Prime subscription?
I have the book and have reread it many times. I will watch this.
I binged the whole thing last night. It's pretty awesome. Worth a month of prime, absolutely.
Thanks to the magic of A/B testing that's not the headline I see, but I suspect that what you're seeing is a typo for 'is every bit as'.
Not only an atheist but a supporter IIRC of the British Humanist Association.
I'm a huge Pratchett fan; I have every discworld book, and am only missing two more of his others to complete the collection. I've read many complete Discworld books to my wife. We have a bathroom copy and a shelf copy of Good Omens. Three episodes in, I think this is better than the book. Early Pratchett has some problems with focus and some mostly irrelevant sideplots, especially ones involving fools. (Later Nobby and Fred, I'm looking at you.) The show has cut some of the cruft out that an editor should have long ago. Most importantly, the casting for Aziraphale and Crowley was excellent.
I'm 4 episodes in, and LOVING IT. Even lovely phrases I thought were missed were worked in later in the show, and it's obviously a labor of love. It's wonderful.
Love the book, have also read it many times over the years, so I'm very happy indeed to hear that they haven't screwed up this adaptation. Will be bingeing as soon as time allows.
I do. Pratchett did not believe in an afterlife.
I've only just started to read the book. Should I finish it before watching this?
Loved this series. A bit heavy on the voice-over, but I think it was a sacrifice needed to preserve Pratchett's classic asides that add so much humor to the story. Gotta say, making the whole thing a buddy comedy (which it sort-of already was, but not quite as much) between Aziraphale and Crowley was classic. Also loved the characterization of Hastur, who they expanded to become the demonic antagonist like they did Gabriel the angelic one.
There is possibly one other person that could have pulled off crowley besides tennant, and that would be Peter Serafinowicz, who played him for the BBC radioplay of the book a few years ago. He may not 'snake hips' his way around, but he'd have still menaced across the screen in a suitable manner.
Just watched the first one so far and enjoyed it - trying not to binge watch it but spread it out. I hope this is a commercial success. Terry left behind a huge body of work that deserves a TV audience. 'Going Postal' was done really well by Sky TV in the UK.
Actually I think that was the weakest of the 3, by far. Some good casting, let down by some clumsy rewriting and editing.
But what if there is, does he believe in it now that he's in it? Hmm...

But what if there is, does he believe in it now that he's in it? Hmm... To quote Hogfather Quote: This is very similar to the suggestion put forward by the Quirmian philosopher Ventre, who said, ""Possibly the gods exist, and possibly they do not. So why not believe in them in any case? If it's all true you'll go to a lovely place when you die, and if it isn't then you've lost nothing, right?"" When he died he woke up in a circle of gods holding nasty-looking sticks and one of them said, ""We're going to show you what we think of Mr Clever Dick in these parts...”
I was only so-so on the book. (I know it's sacrilege around these parts but Pratchett and Gainman never really click for me) But I am a David Tennant fan and can see how the story could make a good show. Anyone who was indifferent to the book watch the show? Is it worth watching in those circumstances?
A BD will undoubtedly come available at some point. That's how I've watched American Gods.
If you are a David Tennant fan then obviously wouldn't it be worth watching just to see David Tennant in a good role?
Interesting someone with that perspective on an author's work would take the time to read and then comment on an article about one of his works.
I was already sold with David Tennant alone but John Hamm is in there too?! Daaaaaaaamn. Gonna watch it when I resub to Prime for The Expanse season 4.
I liked it. I didn't think it needed the Dick Turpin joke. In the book, it was one sentence of narration, not even dialog, about the name of the car, the joke, and his lamenting that no one ever asked him about it; in the show, it was written on the car, mentioned but not explained several times, until finally the joke was told. Obviously Neil was overly pleased with that joke. If they had to drop the Other Four Horsemen, they could have dropped Dick Turpin. It has been a while since I read the book, so I was uncertain in my mind if the ending happened the same way, or if the recounting of their relationship was there. This review confirms that they were new, but they didn't feel wrong in the same way as other additions to canon in stories did (I'm looking at you, Willy Wonka's dentist father). My dream-casting for Aziraphale and Crowley was Peter Sellers, but I understand he was unavailable. Last edited by Buddha Buck on Sat Jun 01, 2019 12:23 pm
It's such a novel role too! A inhuman ageless being that transcends time and space, I'm amazed he was able to slip into it so gracefully!
Haven't read the book (though I have a bunch of other Pratchett books) and two episodes into it I'm loving it. Knowing myself I'll watch at least one more today. It has the spirit of Dirk Gently with hints of Good Place and Douglas Adams' logic, all packaged in a lot of Pratchett-flavored humor, good will, darkness that isn't all that dark until you think again about it, good acting, good sightseeing, some good old British absurdity and a ton of interesting and memorable characters and situations. In other words, another post recommending the series.
Michael Sheen and David Tennant play off each other perfectly. You can see a glimpse of it in the trailers, but they work that well together throughout.
It's a very faithful adaptation (so far -- I've only watched the first couple of episodes), but I do feel that some of the original humor is lost in the translation from book to screen. Some of the jokes have less impact due to the abridged nature of the adaptation. That said, I do think it's off to a good start, and it's clearly in good and capable hands.
I'm going to have the theme song stuck in my head for a long time. Watching the last episode now, have enjoyed it a lot so far. I read the book a while ago and don't remember all the details, but the spirit is definitely there.
Does the acoustic Hawking radiation remove energy, in some sense, from the dumb hole?
Great story. I'd be interested to better understand how come ""sound waves should emerge from the sonic event horizon."" IANAP (I am not a physicist), but my naive expectation is that since sonic phenomena are a macroscopic and collective thing, quantum mechanics' virtual particles wouldn't apply here(?) So what physical law necessitates or permits the sonic 'Hawking radiation'? (In that last sentence you can see me struggling to avoid asking ""why?"" Over the course of a long career in science I have perfected that restraint, even as a verbal shorthand for ""how?""). Last edited by LesDawg on Thu May 30, 2019 9:44 am
""...a kind of superfluity"". I believe this should be ""superfluidity"".
I always wonder why Hawkin's radiation caused a black hole to evaporate. Wouldn't there be an equal chance of the antimatter and the matter particle falling in, and thus over time equalize out. Or is there more of a chance the antimatter particle will fall in?
Wouldn't any escpae eventually lead to evaporation?
Indeed. 'Superfluity' refers to the other kind of dumb hole.
A superfluous point?
And I've found my new 'family friendly' insult word.
Doesn't matter which one falls in, all that matters is that the pair doesn't annihilate thus they are no longer ""virtual""
I've had the same issue. I think that the element is that despite it being matter or antimatter, it's still energy. And that's ultimately what would do the black hole in.
It's the mass (well energy) of the particles that matter. Antimatter does not have an antimass, it only has mass. So it doesn't matter if you eject a matter or antimatter particle, it's simply that you have ejected something that matters.
Since we cannot create solar-mass black holes for real-world testing, using a sonic model that can be created and tested on Earth has significant appeal. The question becomes how useful the sonic model actually is predicting real-world behavior from actual black holes. Most black holes are detected from their active accretion disk and outflow jets driven by the Blandford–Znajek process if the black hole is rotating (meaning a Kerr or Kerr–Newman type). That radiation dominates the Hawking radiation by a huge margin, but it might be possible to look at the rare non-active black holes we've been able to discover and try to see whether their Hawking radiation seems to be quantized or not. From the article, it sounds like they've tried and the signals are just too small.
I am aware that the terminology used here is loose, but hopefully this aids in understanding the principle at play. The explanation has been skimmed over here, but the ""virtual"" particles spawning here are technically Hawking radiation but do not contain any energy, nothing to conserve per the conservation of energy. One virtual particle falls in, another falls out, nothing happens to the black hole. But, if you have two virtual pairs pop into existence in close proximity, pair A and pair B. For pair A its particle falls into the black hole, it's anti-particle falls out. For pair B its anti-particle falls in, and its particle falls out. B particle and A anti-particle interact with each other and annihilate to spawn two protons. Now, you have real particles, but conservation of energy must apply. The energy is provided by the black hole very kindly via the other halves of the virtual particles that still remain inside the black hole, sapping its overall energy/mass slightly.
Matter and antimatter particles both have mass, so either way there is energy escaping the black hole. More importantly for the rate of evaporation, photons are their own antiparticle, and those are what will be most likely to be evaporating, at least until the black hole becomes small enough that its temperature is high enough to start producing massive particles. First neutrinos, then electrons and positrons, then other more massive particles as the black hole's temperature increases.
How does Hawking radiation equate to the black hole evaporating? Assuming equal probability of matter and anti-matter falling into the black hole while their counterpart escapes, couldn't we see the radiation co-exist with a black hole of unchanging mass? Edit: This same discussion began playing out as I typed this!
So it turns out that dumb holes are actually screaming, then?
That's certainly been my experience.
Or more likely mumbling incoherently.
So why doesn't the annihilation of the virtual particles create energy? And if a virtual particle is a photon, what is the opposite that will annihilate it?
I'll probably use the wrong terminology, but hopefully this will get the general gist across ... It's not a function of which particle falls in, but rather the fact that energy has to be supplied to liberate the virtual particles into actual particles. If you read about particle pair production from high-energy gamma rays, you'll see that the interaction of a gamma that has energy greater than 2x the mass of the particles being ""created"" can do so in the presence of a strong electric field (like a nucleus). Energy from the gamma ray is used to liberate the virtual pair into two actual particles, and the remaining energy becomes kinetic energy of the particles. For example, a gamma with energy > 1.022 MeV (2x the rest mass of an electron) can create an electron-positron pair by providing this energy. For Hawking Radiation with an electron-positron pair, the energy to liberate the virtual particle pair must come from the black hole, so it has lost the energy of the particle that escapes, regardless of whether that particle is the electron or the positron. Hopefully that makes reasonable sense.
Unfortunately this looks like one of those things that makes perfect sense when examined at the appropriate level of maths and quantum physics, but any attempt to explain it in any more simple terms to outsiders (of which I am one) fails miserably. The Wikipedia article doesn't make any more sense unfortunately. The one significant aspect that has already been mentioned (and makes sense) is that there is no ""negative mass"" involved, both particle and anti-particle have positive mass - so if you see anything escape and you want conservation principles to hold, the black hole has to be losing mass. How that is supposed to happen by _adding_ something with mass to it continues to be firmly beyond my grasp though (and frankly I'm not a fan of postulating that any law has to hold even in circumstances as extreme as near a black hole for no other reason than ""because it simply must""). Then again, I'm just a dummy...
Typically, the particles talked about for Hawking Radiation are photons which are their own anti particle, and they carry energy away from the black hole depositing negative energy into it. I suspect while it is possible for a macro particle such as an electron to do the same, the chanes of one being created with a positron with such energy that tidal forces are enough to separate them permanently would be vastly small.
No models are perfect, some models are useful. This model uses pretty much the same equations that Hawking used to describe black holes to describe this supersonic flow scenario. So, with a mapping to different physical phenomena, we can predict and see effects that we are predicting on the original. This is a big deal - it gives confidence that our interpretation of this mathematical model is correct. It also gives a place we can test out other ideas and interpretations of the model to see if we are understanding the math.
Would that be Gaussian gibberish?
The black hole is typically defined by its event horizon, not the singularity contained within the event horizon.
A microscopic black hole would essentially be a free energy source. Just drop some protons (or banana peels) into it every now and then and it will convert 100% of the mass into energy (mostly photons). Keep feeding it enough mass to prevent it from evaporating, and it should last forever. Maybe the laws of physics will prevent this sort of lifehack because the outgoing radiation would produce enough pressure to keep us from feeding the black hole? Of course, this kind of ignores the energy cost to actually produce the black hole, but that's an accounting problem. And oh, don't drop it.
Cool.
A quantum vacuum is not empty but quantum superposition of a number of particles. So individual particles popping into existence and annihilating doesn't matter as long as the net state stays the same. When you lose half a pair the superposition breaks unless energy comes from somewhere else.
I love reading about applications of Bose-Einstein condensates. They always pop up in the neatest places.
It's not free, the cost is what you dropped in. But certainly a cheap energy source.
IIRC, this is one of the premises of John Varley's (excellent) 1970s novel, The Ophiuchi Hotline. There, micro-black holes are prospected for in trans-Neptunian space.
Smarter people than me have already explained this, but that's never stopped me before! The root cause is energy conservation. When the virtual particles pop into existence, they're taking out an energy ""loan"". When they can't un-pop, they default on that loan. The Universe always collects its debts, so the black hole has to lose some energy to pay for the newly-permanent mass introduced to the universe.
Was I the only one who had to read the title twice to confirm that ""Sonic Black Holes"" wasn't a new Sonic game? Definitely should only read articles after my morning caffeine dose, not before.
So essentially, the universe has a fixed amount of energy, and some of it can be tied up in particles, or not. Black hole event horizons provide a mechanism for energy to particle conversion, but cannot avoid the quantum matrix accounting when annihilation doesn't happen. In a way, this makes some black holes the largest quantum-defined objects in the universe, doesn't it?
No mass is being added in the first place. The Dirac vacuum is generating self-annihilating virtual pairs of particles which return to the quantum-fluctuation void that birthed them in the first place. The mass-energy book balances. The event-horizon intervenes, though, to do work to realize the pairs. This steals gravitational energy, which is equivalent to mass, from the BH's energy/mass vault. The escaping energy is the getaway car carrying the mass away. Yes, some matter (or photons [or (pseudo)antiphotons]) also falls into the vault, but the overall mass/energy transactions from beginning to end do not make up for the gravitational holdings loss at the end of the day. The incoming currency is in devalued dollars.
So I’ve heard a few explanations. The first is that the common analogy of virtual particle pairs at the event horizon is actually a terrible analogy and isn’t how Hawking calculated it so don’t try to make too much sense out of it. The second was that to escape, the particle must have some positive energy. From conservation of energy, that other particle that got sucked must have had a negative energy, thus decreasing the mass of the black hole. I’ve wondered the same thing as you and those were the best explanations I’ve encountered.
I recall that earlier Arsicle in which metamaterial designs meant for for radiation also mapped to acoustic function.
I'd like to see this compared to someone wearing sunglasses. Is it the VR world, or the current implementation?
Nice to have scientific quantification of what we already knew: people react to what they are perceiving, even if their perceptions don't line up with everyone else's. I have no idea what good manners may look like in a world where people may be interacting with someone halfway-present, but I do know that watching them evolve will be fascinating. Think about the difference between pre and post Bluetooth earbuds; perception of a person talking to themselves in public went from 'probably crazy' to 'possibly crazy, probably on the phone, probably wealthy enough to afford a toy and/or busy enough to need it' to 'normal person being rude'. That's a huge shift. Last edited by Joklers on Wed May 29, 2019 2:59 pm

I'd be interested to see if the effect scales with immersion. How does playing Pokemon Go compare to a full-on VR headset? Does the weight of the headset make a difference?
""Radically altering your sensory input changes your behavior.""
Based on a quick reading of the study, in the social interaction experiments, any reported difference was due to wearing the headset alone. Perhaps it would be interesting to see what'd happen if both participants wore headsets. Maybe someone who had the AR headset on just felt awkward and self conscious about wearing this big thing while the person facing him wasn't wearing anything. What this might come down to is that people who belong to a subculture might just get along better with others who look and act like them. It'd also be interesting to eventually study the long term effects of VR/AR on cognition and behaviors.

Article wrote: The second experiment tested whether people wearing AR headsets would avoid the chair where Chris was sitting, as opposed to sitting on top of him. All of them avoided that chair. I'm not surprised at all; I remember hearing about when television was new and people would get dressed up for socializing and might put out coffee or tea service or a relish plate ... before watching the evening news. That was the social context for those people at that time for being face-to-face with someone in your living room. Right now, the social context for being in a room with a person is not sitting on them or turning your back to them. On the other hand, it's already a bit of a standard trope for characters in sci-fi to walk right through holographic/AR advertisements and projections of people as a sort of demonstration of comfort or even dominance. I can definitely see a transition period where some folks will sit down purposefully in an AR-""occupied"" chair to inconvenience the person who didn't show up in person, but what comes after that? Careful avoidance? A virtual-presence area of the party for interacting with pseudo-attendees? A physical-presence-only area of the party for curmudgeons?

The person on the bus arguing loudly with someone nobody can see will just be in moderately poor taste - kinda like the person who just got on without goggles and sat on said imaginary friend.
Just watch out for guys with ""POOR IMPULSE CONTROL"" tattooed on their foreheads.
Denno Coil introduced the concept of AR games and AR-augmented cityscapes nearly a decade before Pokemon Go (although the PS Vita already had a mostly unused AR mode in 2011). It's an interesting look at a (at the time) nascent technology, and not as negatively as Stephenson does in Snow Crash. Maybe I should revisit it and see how it has held up.

I've watched a VR hockey match and flinched my head away from the puck, but I think it'd be a long way between that and screaming and running away in fear.
I like to use Richie's Plank Experience, a sort of VR equivalent (you take an elevator up a building, where there's a narrow plank you can walk out onto, and jump off of if you choose), as an intro to VR for friends and family. I had one friend who was too scared to jump off, even knowing it's not real. So, for someone with a serious fear of heights, I could see it happening. (As an aside, I wonder if this sort of thing could backfire, you normalize situations that should be scary, and desensitize people to real-world risks...)
""If something bad happens to your avatar in a social context, it seems to engage the same neural circuitry that is engaged when something happens to the actual you in a social context."" Given the present state of society, sounds like a virtual hell is also inevitable.

About that... I used to be VERY AFRAID OF SPIDERS. But since I played farpoint (it have truck sized spiders and dog sized spiders thst jumps into my face),... . I'm no longer frozen, running away, or jumping like idiot when I saw a spider in real life. --- After I played driveclub vr, I drive my car faster than usual (noticed because I have a bad habbit of taking a glance of the speedometer) --- There's also the opposite effect, where real life experience affect VR experience. When I stick my head into the freezer in Job Simulator fridge... I feel the cold air. Tried multiple times. Yep, I feel cold air.
It seems worth noting the context of the 'Gargoyles are no fun to talk to' line: it includes the fact that distracted people are kind of annoying(not that you need anything higher tech than a smartphone addict to tell you that); but is not limited to that. The fact that theirs is a very intrusive sort of surveillance-distraction is specifically mentioned; and quite salient to why people dislike them. (Also the reason why this one gets gutted like a fish shortly after the excerpt) ""Gargoyles represent the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporation. Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them. Nothing looks stupider, these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society... Gargoyles are no fun to talk to. They never finish a sentence. They are adrift in a laser-drawn world, scanning retinas in all directions, doing background checks on everyone within a thousand yards, seeing everything in visual light, infrared, millimeter. wave radar, and ultrasound all at once. You think they're talking to you, but they're actually poring over the credit record of some stranger on the other side of the room, or identifying the make and model of airplanes flying overhead.

“...we can work with technology companies to figure out the norms...” Recent experiences suggest this will probably lead to terrible norms, even if Joe Avatar is looking over everyone’s shoulder.
Considering how badly smartphones have already affected social interactions, I'm not optimistic about widespread AR, even if they do get a headstart on studying its effects.
Iain M. Banks' Surface Detail did that one beautifully, and takes the next step as well: https://www.amazon.com/Surface-Detail-C ... B007K4K8YC
So, is what you're saying that there is a way to turn Trump into a somewhat normal, sane person?
I'm compelled to wonder if specifically developed AR applications could prove effective in efforts to treat Asperger's Syndrome and other variants of Autism Spectrum Disorders. A Google search on research programs that examine the behavioral and cognitive impacts that may result from a regimen of straight forward video games introduced to those diagnosed with spectral disorders yields quite a few hits. There's certainly fertile ground for Autism research ... and quite possibly even the promise of effective treatment ... to be found in AR platforms. Given that AR can incorporate anything from real-world simulacra up to purely fanciful, (and, perhaps, willingly or even joyfully embraced) components and ""characters"" into the daily living environs of those on the spectrum, one can't help but imagine the potential for positive outcomes among at least a subset of the population. Edit: I began the above comment and then finished it after an interruption. Having since read through the balance of comments posted, I suspect that I'm entirely too optimistic in my world view. I probably need to be much more down with the substantiated dystopic reality engulfing us all. Last edited by BobsYourUncleBob on Wed May 29, 2019 7:48 pm
Some aspects of reality are, by their inherent natures so hopelessly corrupted, so abjectly broken, that any possibility of remediation lies well beyond the bounds of science.
Extremely common in no-clip MMOs. I'm not sure standing inside another player/NPC is a matter of immersion, when the act is consciously one of weirdness. It's simply indecorous. Imagine a simple pixelated platformer, and an avatar hauling wood into his tiny camp, dropping it wherever. The natural thing to do is less frequently (never) place it atop the campfire sprite tile (except as a joke). There's no ""sense of self"" or whatever psychometa, it's just a taste for order and reason. This all goes out the window when people are crowding into a boss fight (or after arena vendors lul). I'd be interested in having them muse over an odd behavior in an FF MMO (probably XI not XIV?) I'd heard about long ago, regarding conversation-occupied NPCs (ie one user at a time) that everyone needed to use. Slowly, laboriously. While the normal horde response is to for everyone jump and yell (ie keep clicking) until you butt in, it seems these users (JP iirc) began queueing up. They were ""physically"" standing in line, waiting their turn. It'd also be interesting to ponder the propagation of a visible, novel social act. People are keen (ie hardwired) on observing individuals/groups for data on ""what everyone is up to these days"", maybe to learn known optimums but also tribal cohesion blah blah. Monkey see monkey do.
Robotics;Notes featured a less deviated but tablet-wielding society, with prominent AR (including an AR-interaction-only digital character) and a shot at portraying a normalized tablet sling around the body. I think most of the adaptation was about building a giant robot and the aspirational sweat of youth and dreams or whatever. I guess it can't be all that recommendable if it was forgettable.
A very interesting subject and a nice article. We surely have just seen the beginning. + * Better video conferencing * Map apps may give subtle hints where to go * Important alerts (tsunami, tornado, terrorist attack) could be pushed with instructions how to get safe * Enhanced social interaction for people with disabilities * Enhanced remote first line medical examinations could be done using input from personal devices - * Google-glass made people uncomfortable... * Adds will skillfully use the immersion of AR * What if a colleague is using a ""see your friend naked"" App? * Amateur surveillance Apps will pop up, like ""where have you seen this person last time?"" * Awkward interaction between AR and non-AR people +/- * Online shopping will get be boosted * The sex industry will certainly come up with applications * Sounds like an enhanced DARPA LifeLog
In WoW, there are lots of high places, like cliffs and bridges. I have a complete fear of heights. When my toon walks across a thin bridge up high, my feet tingle and I start to breathe differently. For a while, I would have my toon jump off to prove I could do that, but I had to stop doing that as it didn't really help my fear of heights.
A while back I mentioned to a friend of mine in South Africa that people talking on their phone in a bus was the height of rudeness. She was surprised: apparently it's acceptable there already. Maybe we can save ourselves some grief if we're careful.
Let me know when watching my digital avatar exercise actually causes my weight loss! :-)
I want to know how people would react and feel if someone without AR goggles stopped where an avatar was. IE if someone without AR sat in the chair where the avatar was how would the other AR users react? If they had been talking to the avatar in the chair would they ask the person to move? Or would they ask the avatar own to move? If they hadn't been talking with the avatar would they ignore the whole sitting on avatar issue or would it be annoying?
Trouble is, good manners seem to be fading in general, as more and more people are absorbed into their own little self-centered realities. I can't tell you how many times I've gone out to a restaurant and seen entire families silently glued to their phones, or mothers totally neglecting their children because they're catching up on the latest drivel to cross their Facebook feeds. I've been cycling with my daughter in the park, only to find the path blocked by a horde of Pokemon players in a raid or something (which I used as an opportunity to very loudly give my daughter a lesson on common courtesy). And so forth. Even in face-to-face interactions, ""my way or the highway"" seems to be the norm these days; just look at politicians, who are supposed to represent the best of us but more often seem to have the social maturity of teenagers. And don't even get me started on the quality of discourse when your fellows are nothing more than text on a message board... So, I'm not sure that ""fascinating"" would be the word I'd use to describe the continued emergence of new social norms. More like ""terrifying"".
""Even though they knew consciously that the pit wasn’t real (because they had seen the real-world version) they still reacted as if the pit were really there. "" I've experienced this in VR - if you go into the Loft House in WMR, you can jump right to the edge and stand looking down at the city below and then step off the edge... and you KNOW it's not real, but there's a bit of the old reptile brain saying 'don't do that!' But after a few of these moments, you get over it. I was playing in one of the Void games (the one in Las Vegas) and it has a few of these 'you have to walk across a narrow walkway' moments and they don't really work on me anymore. Now, the real scary question is: what happens if I forget I'm not in VR? Fortunately, it's still easy to tell which is which...
So Skype with avatars. Because when I show up to a meeting where tired of people wasting time over analyzing something I fully intend on showing up at Space Ghost and shooting random bracelet blasts at their face while speaking in random non-sequitur. Blast
I think another consideration will be what happens when people become trained to be dismissive of the ever-more-realistic avatars that surround them in AR & VR and then bring that behavior to their interactions with physical people in unencumbered reality. It might get frustrating when you give the wave-off gesture and the person doesn't disappear. Also, I imagine that pretty quickly a convention will be developed in VR gaming to give the edges tall buildings a distinct appearance when one can depart them without falling, so that this appearance gets tied to the learned behavior change. This will help protect game publishers from lawsuits relating to people walking off the edges of actual buildings, and open up building owners to lawsuits if they make the appearance of their roof or balcony edges match the VR convention.
Since you turn off the AR part so that you have better accuracy and battery life while playing Pokémon Go, it really is not an AR or VR game. It’s a geo location game.
That cycles picture reminds me of ET.
Terrible. Started watching it and like 5 minutes in I was like ""WTF is this?"". Then I noticed it was directed by Joe Nichol...who for some reason wants to be known by his nickname he got when he was 10: ""McG"". He directed other masterpieces such as the Charlie Angels movies. He's 50 now and still goes by ""McG"". Imagine if Steven Spielberg went by his nickname. ""Schindler's List directed by Stevie"". But anyway, terrible, implausible awful movie. There seems to be a ton of bad things dropped on Netflix in the past few days.
So this is some Stranger Things leftovers that've been microwaved by McG. Keeping in mind that Stranger Things is already one big 80's pop culture reference. Fantastic.
If stranger things referenced this one steals. And this was for kids right? Dick in mouth jokes? Swallowing semen? Why did the astronaut lady need to be impaled through the mouth? Not being a Puritan, just wondering who the target (age) was of the material. And I had to fast forward a bunch eventually, just could not sit through the slog. If anyone could, did the Chinese girl ever have pay off? Thought her set up was a bit bizarre. Last edited by firsttimecaller on Sun May 26, 2019 10:35 am
I suffered through 30 minutes of this before I gave up. I don't think the target audience is anyone older than about 10 or 11. It's definitely not another ""Stranger Things,"" which, while also focused on children of roughly the same age, had competent dialogue, acting, etc. The visuals are pretty, especially the initial mountain shots in 4k HDR. Otherwise I'd make it a hard pass.
So, Goonies meets Independence Day? Just how drunk do you have to be to watch that?
If it missed a stereotype, it was only because it was so bad that I was fast forwarding through certain parts of it. (Two of the black characters comment, in character, that they seem to be talking like characters from an 80s movie, which is not so much hanging a lampshade on it as wearing a hood for 'ironic' reasons.) I've seen it mentioned in proximity to 'Attack the Block', which was a vastly better movie, and which, if you're thinking about watching this movie because you liked 'Attack the Block', just go watch AtB again and let this sink into oblivion. I feel very badly for the actors, particularly the leads, who are completely misused. So awful I gave it a negative rating on Netflix, which I have never done before.
Well, there's a reason those things got dropped by netflix, and not picked up by netflix.
I can't read McG without hearing it in Kermode's parodic voice (check out his review of Terminator: Salvation if you're unfamiliar). On the other hand McG's misgivings about destroying a classic car for his art suggest he isn't completely devoid of human feeling.
It's actually one of the current pop-culture phrases I never managed to warm up to. ""Rihanna dropped her new single on Friday. Luckily, it didn't break, and so it's still expected to be released some time next week."" Oh, and, yes: Do get off my lawn, please.
We've cancelled Netflix as they have lost content and their own content is getting too formulaic. We rotate most streaming services anyway but Netflix is now further down the list. Might check it out a month or two a year. Netflix needs to be careful. They are accumulating huge debt creating quantity of content with less focus on quality. AT&T also seems to be playing this card with HBO, cutting budgets on quality while focusing on quantity. Disney+ OTOH has a massive proven top tier library that has already profited at the box office.
Perfect summer fare, so mind melting garbage then.
About that vintage car the kids commandeer for their journey: it was originally supposed to be a 1974 Pontiac Firebird, which fans of 1970s TV will recognize as the model Jim Rockford drove on The Rockford Files. ""But it turns out there simply aren't enough of those left to trash any of them,"" said Stentz. (Filming can be rough in cars.) There are plenty of old 1973 Ford Mach 1 Mustangs, however, so that's the car they used. ""McG said, 'A part of you feels bad doing this. They don't make these anymore and we're destroying one. but at least it's giving its life up for art.'"" I guess Hollywood hasn't heard of kit cars before. You don't need to trash an actual '74 Firebird. In fact, kit cars are a great way for people to get an old school expensive as hell classic on the cheap if they have mechanical skills (or a friend that does). Sure, it's not the real deal, but it looks exactly the same. You think anyone is peeking at VIN's or under the hood in a movie?
WOW! This is sooo weird, i just loaded up my netflix and seen this and thought this will make for a good rainy Sunday watching, as i was waiting for the movie to start, i decided to check on the comments on another story and BAM here is an article on the very same movie i'm about to watch! I skipped the story in case of spoilers and came right to the comments but after reading 13 posters saying that the movie is crap/ripoff really not sure i want to invest the 98 minutes to watch this. At least i still have 3 seasons Lucifer to catch up on.

We rotate services as well with one or two regulars. Might switch out Netflix for Disney+ as the monthly regular and only check out Netflix a couple times a year. HBO no longer a regular either. Rotating services is a great way to get a lot of content over a year for less money. Not as doable for larger households but a method to try if looking to cut costs.
Go with Lucifer. If you are like the most bored 10 year old in the world and no one has ever been as bored as you and this is absolutely the only movie ever made, then go with 'Rim of the World ' Last edited by Thr2hrmrf on Mon May 27, 2019 12:07 pm
Except Disney+ will be offering a discount for a yearly sub. $69/ year ($5.75/mo) or monthly sub at $6.99 per. It's not a huge savings, but Disney has enough content to easily cover a year up front. https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/ ... ve-series/ The pricing makes it easy enough to keep a sub to a more expensive service and just add Disney to the mix.
Another yawner of Netflix movies. These Netflix movies seem very AI written like. Inputs are, take the top 5 watch movies within some sort of parameters, and spit out some sausage that is based on it. Almost everything Netflix makes now is the same as the made for TV movies back in the day... cheap. ""Maria"" is the same way, except its worse in that they end it, before ending it.
Maria is a skip too?
It sounds like they missed a great opportunity for some cross-promotional synergy. Have the kids mix some Orange Vanilla Coke Zero with a decent rum, and thereby illustrate for the audience that they should have been drinking for an hour or two before watching this.
It was a waste of time. Rather rematch just about any H-Wood made revenge action movie.
I can admire the heart that went into this, but it really is kind of a dud with some redeeming qualities. Mostly, the cast seem to be having fun, and that creates a watchable kind of chemistry. They'll likely become Disney+ stars. Younger viewers probably won't be turned off by the exagerated stereotypes the characters are based on, or notice how plot points resemble those of many other outbreak series. This wants to be Goonies but instead it's an ambitious episode of Doctor Who without the wit to bring it off.
I agree. I'm okay with some foul language in the movies I watch with my kids, but this one seemed intentionally over the top. We stopped watching halfway through and won't be finishing it.
Another Netflix ""check all the boxes"" Original Pass
Don't worry, the low interest rate corporate debt fueled binge is coming to an end. Soon we'll enter a new age of low budget cerebral sci-fi, minus the hispter revisionism.
Haha, sounds better
Should have known, listened to the posters and trusted my instincts, that's 98 minutes i'll never get back.
Terrible. Too choppy, too cliche and I never got to see Chunk or Elliot!

Agreed. The profanity and sex jokes coming out of teens or possibly preteens was definitely over the top. In all my life I have yet to hear real life kids of that age talk like that. Seeing it in a movie didn't make it funny. It didn't help the story either in any way and just made me think the writers or directors had no class. The majority of original content on Netflix seems to be increasingly TV-MA or else pushing the upper boundary on TV-14 with content that hurts the story telling. I don't know if they are just scraping the bottom of the barrel in talent or if they have a mandate to junkify every story to hit a predefined rating. On the plus side, ""Good Sam"" is an excellent attempt by Netflix at creating a Hallmark Saturday movie. If you are into those kinds of movies, they did that one right.

Oh it's a show, at first glance I confused the image with a United Colors of Benetton Ad.
Did one of them kick wolfman in the nards?
More slavish devotion to 80s movie concepts and tropes. And on top of it, sounds like it's crappy, too. The first two seasons of Stranger Things were great. Ended on a solid note. But then the third season was announced and it showed we'd be staying in the same old Hawkins with the same old characters and the same Upside-Down threats. But this time there's a mall and teenage romance drama! And now Netflix puts out more 80s-pandering. Hopefully this isn't a sign of a trend to come. I didn't grow up in the 80s. The idea of newer media set in the 80s and paying homage to 80s movies and media was neat at first, but I'd like to see them move on and do something new. With Stranger Things, they should've moved on from Hawkins after season 2 to make the series an anthology with season 3 onward, where each new season takes place in a new location, featuring different characters who would have to contend with a different permutation of the Upside-Down, or possibly brand new threats. By all means, keep the series set in the 80s, but don't use 80s movie concepts, tropes, or references to 80s media out the wazoo. Already came up with an idea for a new season wholly separate from Hawkins that would've been really cool: Several students at a university start experiencing weird and dangerous happenings on their campus. They start sharing their stories over the BBS system their college has to try and find out what's going on. Eventually they meet up and try to uncover the mystery behind the incidents before it's too late. No leaning on 80s college movie tropes, Revenge Of The Nerd stuff, or all that; just a good original horror-thriller story under the moniker ""Stranger Things"".
Of course, you do have to trust a company that is well known for its practice of artificial scarcity.
This was a horrid movie. Generic characters, generic story, awful editing and as some mentioned, unnecessarily tasteless 'jokes' from the kids. Pretty sure the screenwriter never interacted with 10-13 yo in any meaningful way. The black kid was a sickening caricature. The kid actors were the movie only saving grace.
I realized from the onset it was supposed to be a kid's movie. I tried but only made it about 15 minutes before just being fed up with how awful it was. Agreed on McG as a director as well, he's low budget Michael Bay at his best. But he's got a good name in the industry because he executive produced Chuck and Nikita.
I stumbled across it last week and watched it. It had promise, but seemed to fall a bit flat.
It did not fall a bit flat, it fell a whole lot flat. Although there was promise, overall it sucked. Last edited by Thr2hrmrf on Sun May 26, 2019 5:24 am
Obligatory: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8743064/ While IMDB does have issues with gaming the ratings, it currently has a 4.8/10 as of the time of this post. Anything less than a 6 is a hard pass from me, got better things to do with my time. This amused me though: ""While this is technically a time travel movie, the trope is more of a framing device, not the heart of the film. In other words, don't expect it to adhere to real-world physics."" I'm looking forward to all the actual time travel real-world physics references for objects larger than quarks
Is this where we're going to relitigate Black Lives Matter with trolls for the 98,000th time?
Agreed. It started well, but wasn't happy with where it went or the ending. After finishing it I wasn't sure what it was trying to accomplish or say.
Well this whole article is almost a copy/paste of the one she posted on April 22nd, so we may as well import the entire comment thread from last month and then lock it.

“When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you’re going to see some serious shit.” —Renowned physicist and DeLorean restoration expert Dr. E. Brown, explaining “real-world physics”
It's on my list to watch. I'll probably get around to it last week.
Saw the preview on Netflix and thought it looked interesting. My pet peeve with time travel movies are the ones that postulate everything has a fixed fate - e.g. if you change something in the past it will ""break"" the future or the universe will self-correct (save a life, person dies anyway but of something else). I think that's largely lazy writing, or perhaps lazy thinking. If we're all fated to have a certain outcome, we have no point in existing as independent, thinking beings - the outcome will happen regardless, and the world we live in is the only one that can exist. That's not an outlook on life I can endorse.
Only managed to watch half of it before I couldn't take it any more. Avoid.
Ooh wow, this looks even worse than the Kim Possible live-action movie.
*After looking at the sixth pic* Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me you built a time machine... with no RAM?
IMDB gaming/brigading is real, especially for anything dealing with black people mattering.
Rotten Tomatoes is deploying a requirement that reviewers prove they've seen the movie. I look forward to the effect that will have on reviews.
personally I am waiting for someone to tell me how time travel works without space travel. you see in the time it took you to read this you moved hundreds of kilometers from where you started. if you go back in time. you also need to account for the rotation, and revolution of the earth, and move yourself in space to the correct spot. You need all of that to go back just a few seconds. Try going back centuries and unless you know the exact rotational and revolutionary speed of the planet for every day in between you end up floating in the vacuum of space. (space ship time machines at least can pretend to address that issue)
or... you could just go back in time and never watch the Netflix preview.
I watched this last week and was left feeling quite disappointed. It made both a poor time travel movie and a poor message movie. My review of it would basically call it similar to Run, Lola, Run but not as well done. They kept bringing up the intellectually interesting parts of time travel (what if we run into our past selves from a previous trip) and then promptly hand waving it away (don't worry, we tweaked the combobulator so it basically resets our last trip completely). The whole time travel part of the movie is like this and it was pointless. As far as a message goes, the only thing I got out of it was basically the message of ""Shit happens."" It never actually went anywhere. The whole movie was a disappointment.
Haven't seen it, but since I live there, I can tell you that they probably leave home at 5:30am to get to school, as Bronx Science is basically at the far end of the subway line they're walking away from (2 train, Church Avenue Station) it is a long haul, and one of the reasons I chose not to go there. The bus on the right is the B35, which usually shows up 3 or 4 at a time, then 20 minute gaps to the next batch. On the left is a Walgreen's, and behind them is a Burger King that used to be a McDonalds, that used to be a bank.
caution live frogs wrote: Saw the preview on Netflix and thought it looked interesting. My pet peeve with time travel movies are the ones that postulate everything has a fixed fate - e.g. if you change something in the past it will ""break"" the future or the universe will self-correct (save a life, person dies anyway but of something else). These are literally opposite tropes. The first one is the “butterfly effect” trope. Changing a single event, even in small ways, can have enormous ripple consequences for the future. Usually “breaking” the future doesn’t mean there’s literally no future, but that the future you end up in isn’t the future you want. But you only need that event to happen that way to have the future you want. (This might repeat multiple times with different alternate futures, until you re-create the one you want!) Change the past, and there will still be a future, just not one anything like the one you remember. The “self-correcting timeline” trope, on the other hand, works in pretty much the opposite way. No matter how much you change, the thing you’re trying to prevent will keep happening anyway. (Murder Kirk’s father? Blow up a planet? It doesn’t matter, Kirk and Spock still become bros for life!) Also, everyone dies anyway. It’s just a question of when. caution live frogs wrote: I think that's largely lazy writing, or perhaps lazy thinking. If we're all fated to have a certain outcome, we have no point in existing as independent, thinking beings - the outcome will happen regardless, and the world we live in is the only one that can exist. That's not an outlook on life I can endorse. This seems like a reaction to the “self-correcting timeline” trope, and a fair one. I’ve never liked the idea of predetermination, and sometimes it erodes any of the meaning or joy of prior stories (like Terminator 3 shitting all over Terminator 2’s message by making Judgment Day unpreventable). But I still enjoyed 2009’s Star Trek, it was a fun story. Or maybe you’re reacting to the “closed loop” trope, which hasn’t really about fate, so much as it’s about physics. The idea in a closed loop story is that everything happens once—you can still argue that people in that story had free will and made their own decisions, but that they made those choices with the time-travel interlopers already in their timeline. Thus the time-travel changed literally nothing, because it never didn’t happen. I don’t think that type of story undermines free will—it just means that you never get to see what choices anyone would’ve made without time travel. Anyway. Some thoughts on time travel tropes. There are a lot of them.
Yes, it's not like the planet stands still, that's why Dr Who is cool - the Tardis can move through time and space and I believe did from the beginning, or at least as far back as I've seen reruns.
I thought the movie was excellent, but very sad. Spoiler: show No matter how hard you plan, no matter what your powers--because they improve their time travel apparatus throughout the film--your friends are still getting killed. The dreams you had about going to MIT, and what your talents could bring to the world, all get put aside just because you don't want your friends to die.
REPEAT AFTER ME! THERE WAS NO KIM POSSIBLE LIVE ACTION MOVIE! THERE WAS NO KIM POSSIBLE LIVE ACTION MOVIE. THERE WAS NO HIGHLANDER 2. THERE WAS NO HIGHLANDER 2.
To me, the issue with the movie was the black mirror aspect of it: It gets dark really fucking fast, and well.... if you don't live in USA you might like it a bit more, but it sure is dark right now, so that film didn't help the feeling of gloom.
NOR 3, 4, 5, 6, NOR 7!!!! Damnit!!!
I didn't mind the storyline, it was fine along the lines of ""fixing time isn't as easy as you'd think"". More along the lines of a slightly dark cartoony original Twilight Zone.
If you want to see a piece of time travel fiction that notes and addresses this issue you could read the novel All Our Wrong Todays. Nobody truly thinks about the real issues faced by time travellers.
I enjoyed the film overall, but the ending felt to me like the writer made the characters do stupid things to fit the narrative and not their personalities? I don't know if that makes any sense. The obvious solution to this problem was right in front of them and then one of them sort of...chose not to do it?
Let's just say that mass has a sort of gravitational ""DNA"" and any attempts to time travel automatically drops you into the matching gravitational field from where the jump originated. Even if a location has a drastic configuration change in the matter, the moments before and after are still keeping you positioned, with a frame dragging effect of sorts. Being able to travel in both time and location is the more advanced next level tech. Last edited by DataMeister on Fri May 24, 2019 10:44 pm
That is a good summary. It had moments where you think it's about to get good, then it doesn't and by the end it basically felt like a waste of time.
I'll admit I was lured in by seeing Spike Lee's name prominently displayed in the Netflix ad. Learned my lesson. Should've looked closer. Decent premise with a not so good execution...
So you think people are deliberately negging anything with black people mattering, you are implying that these people don't think black people matter, yet they matter to these people enough to waste their time negging a boring film unoriginal film. It is possible for a black director and cast to make a shitty film, I love Marvel films but Black Panther was utter toss. Sidney Poitier directed Stir Crazy which is great and Richard Pryor was a comedy genius.
It seems the sort of movie that makes me want to re-watch Steins;Gate - fixing temporal errors done right! This one sounds a bit cringe-worthy, what with the emphasis on message. Disclaimer: I made it about 20 minutes into Get Out before switching off... for me it was a choice between that or grinding the enamel off my teeth. This sounds similar. Sorry USA, but your racial sensitivities don't always translate internationally. (Not intended to be condescending - I'm Australian and we have our own issues. I am most definitely not claiming superiority!)
If they live in Flatbush how do they go to Bronx Science? That's a long commute.
I enjoyed the movie until the end, and by the end I mean the scene, before the credits because the story just ""ends""
Obviously, they could figure out how to build a time machine because they had already built a teleporter.
Black Panther, sadly, wasn't that unusual for Marvel. There's the entire set of Spiderman movies that have the exact same formulaic problems that Black Panther has, with Homecoming being the exception. Lots of slow plodding dialog that really has little to do with what we came to see - super special effects and a action driven storyline. Others also have that problem - Iron Man, Hulk, the first avengers movie, and Captain America to a lesser extent. OTOH, I liked Guardians, Thor, Dr Strange, and the later Avengers. Maybe because there was more tongue in cheekiness going on, and a lot less whining about the girl/society/I'm too serious/woe is me crap in the others?
Interesting perspective on the locale, and one that highlights a very problematic aspect of time travel movies in general: In describing the transition from Bank > McDonalds > Burger King, it becomes clear just how much of a bitch it is to accurately manage film continuity when jumping between various time blocks. (And that's to say nothing of the errant Starbucks cup or three).
The article is actually an experiment designed to study the effects that result from temporal shifts between publication dates. While this comment is being read in the current time-line, the duplicate post on April 22nd doesn't actually exist! When this comment thread is exited to initiate a search for the article existing in the April 22nd time-line this comment thread actually ceases to exist in its ""present"" form! We can expect a 3rd such iteration of this article at some point in the not-to-distant future, which will examine the results from an attempt to merge these two previously divergent time-lines. (I suspect this is part of a wider-ranging study that's focused on temporally shifting comment trolls.)
Oh, exciting, thank you. Was I the only one who, at first glance, thought ""Oh, Tom Hanks"" rather than Arnie?! BTW, small typo: ""study"" > ""studio""? Last edited by Verbail on Thu May 23, 2019 9:51 am
I fully support this emerging trend of “let’s all pretend the shitty studio-forced sequels made without creator input never happened.”
Fond memories! Definitely watch this one!
I assume that they're also ignoring Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles. I only mention this one because I thoroughly enjoyed season two.
sorry cant watch the trailer till later.   Did the T800 melt himself down at the end of Terminator 2? where did this T800 come from?
Ooh. I mean, I enjoyed Genisys, but even so: ooh.
I hope they have some good quotable lines.
The first Terminator trailer since T2 that actually looks good!
A young Anakin John Connor built him out of scrap parts?
Sadly we’re still a long way from “hey maybe if people are doing actually interesting creative stuff in TV spinoffs, they should get brought back into the movie universe.” Although (mild MCU spoiler): Spoiler: show Avengers: Endgame made a little bit of movement here. The MCU was notoriously bad at re-integrating any TV spinoff into the “connected” MCU, but Endgame including James D’Arcy as Edwin Jarvis finally brought a character and actor introduced on TV up into the MCU...

Still looks like it will lack the undergirding that made T1 and T2 so compelling to watch: the extremely human scale of the combat. There were no ultra-flashy acrobatics or super-speed blah to ruin the very real-feeling terror we shared with Sarah Connor. That hyperspeed sledgehammer whack at the end of the trailer looks completely ridiculous.
No. I'm done with Terminator. There is a finite number of things you can do with this franchise due to the way it was structured. The second movie ended it perfectly. Judgement day came and went. Done. END OF A GREAT STORY. The Sarah Connor Chronicles worked because it was set between the original and Terminator 2. There is plenty of options in there.....for a TV show. But this constant, and annoying, retcon time after time shows that you have boxed yourself into a story corner. Genisys was the ultimate example of this. The movie was entertaining but dear god, the gymnastic back-flips it had to do to work in this franchise's story line was painful and made me swear off any future Terminator movie.
I don’t know. The Salvation’s trailer with a Nine Inch Nails song was fantastic. Actually tricked me into believing that movie would be better than T2.
Ah yes, the other spinoff that starred a Game of Thrones cast member as Sarah Connor.
It’s produced (not “executive produced” but actually produced) by James Cameron, and “story by James Cameron” so he’s engaged and involved. And it’s directed by the director of Deadpool. If it doesn’t have a bunch of quotable lines, I’ll be pissed.
This might be the first time a sequel ever made me feel really old, but the fact that this franchise is 35 years old really stood out for me here (Linda and Arnold look great, but that's besides the point).
It's too bad there wasn't a third movie in the Terminator franchise. I have hopes that one will exist in the near future.
Hmm ... maybe, but Aliens is a contender for that title, too.
My internal monologue right after reading this post: ""but that is what this is, the 6th but really it's like the... OHHHHHHHHH""
Hey, the guy got drop-kicked in Africa and shrugged it off, so it seems like he's ready for one more battle with liquidmetal.
Regarding the spoiler: Spoiler: show I imagine that's not just the ""we don't want to cross the streams"", but part of the ownership issue. The best shows (for me) that have been a part of the Marvel TV push have been on Netflix, which Disney doesn't own. It's probably not a coincidence that the first cross-over comes from a show that aired on ABC, which Disney does own. With Loki now getting a TV show on Disney+, I imagine we'll start seeing some interplay between the two. Hopefully not too much (otherwise it comes off as an advertisement for Disney+, and the content is less accessible to those who haven't watched the TV shows, but you know...some. My real hope is that they introduce Fantastic 4...properly. Make a big deal in some other movie about our need to prepare against space threats, send a team of scientists to explore it and leave it there. Reintroduce them in a second movie coming to save the day. No ""origin"" movie, just we see them leave and at some point they come back and start fighting evil. Not necessarily ""with"" the Avengers, but just there. That actually leads me to a different point: part of the problem with TV is that you then have a much bigger cast to coordinate and handle stories on. The interplay, where it exists, should essentially be easter eggs and one-offs. Comic book logic and team-ups work in a world where there is effectively infinite ink. They work less well when you have to wrangle actual actors.
THAT'S what the franchise is about?! I never saw it myself because I always thought they were documentaries on the unsung heroes of the SCSI bus and Ethernet networks.
Yeah T2 was where they should have quit. Now I wouldn't mind a ""Running Man"" reboot.
Yeah, at the end of the day, he's aging...but I don't know too many people who could take someone running full speed and drop-kicking them and remain upright. Even if they were fully aware that was going to happen. Without any preparation? Dude is still ready to terminate, if you ask me.
Well that team can't get it right then it's game over man, game over.
""this film is not yet rated"" It better he R rated. As all Terminator films should be. Also we need more gratuitous ultra violence to go with the somewhat deep story (for their time the Terminator stories were damn well told out on the screen) that the first two had. Not really happy about seeing g the terminators pulling off matrix level acrobatics. They we're the Mighty Glacier trope and did it perfectly. You could run, you could hide, but you couldn't rest because it would eventually catch up. The T1000 kind of screwed that up but instead of walking through walls it lore or less slowly moved around crevaces. More nimble yes, but still a mighty glacier, it didn't leap from wrecks, it rode them out. Hopefully we more dodgeball with drillpress fights. Looking forwards to it though.
Pensionator
that dude wasnt running full speed at him, the video i saw, had the dude waving to the camera as he walked closer, and then probably from 10 feet away, he jump kicked him. Security handled it really fast, and arnold shrugged it off.
Is that a cover of a Björk song?
The trailer looks good though. Please be good!
I've considered it, but always resisted that analysis.
Guy could have been leaping from a car going 30 and Arnie would have just stumbled. Not only is he an ABSOLUTE UNIT, he has a good sense of balance. He is in way better shape than I am, and I'm less than half his age.
Don't bet the farm on it. There's a chance, but the Tencent Pictures funding and Fast & Furious-style action tells me this is very definitely intended to be a dual-market film with China. Expect at least one shot of the Golden Gate Bridge and very little intense dramatic acting. I can tell already it's not going to have any scenes that match the intensity of the T-800's demise in Terminator 1.
From recycled Tesla batteries/power wall's
I had no idea what you guys are talking about, so I googled and found this: https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/video/4 ... th-africa/ and https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/m ... ick-attack Schwarzenegger has hilarious quotes in the news reports like ""I thought I was just jostled in the crowd. I didn't know someone kicked me until I saw the video."" and ""A lot of you have asked, but I’m not pressing charges. I hope this was a wake-up call, and he gets his life on the right track. But I’m moving on and I’d rather focus on the thousands of great athletes I met at @ArnoldSports Africa.""
No, between 2 and 3.

They work less well when you have to wrangle actual actors. Continuing the discussion of a minor spoiler from Endgame: Spoiler: show I don't think it's an issue of ""Marvel owns ABC but not Netflix""; Jarvis's cameo is really the first time we've ever seen a Marvel TV series acknowledged in a Marvel movie, ever. There's never been any crossover from, say, Runaways or Cloak and Dagger, despite Disney owning or co-owning the channels where they run. Hell, nobody in the movies has even acknowledged that Coulson is alive. There's not much acknowledgement in the other direction, either; while SHIELD heavily integrated the MCU in its first season (guest appearances by Sif and Nick Fury, and the plot of Winter Soldier playing a major role in the season arc), it's barely acknowledged the movies since. You're right that the reason for this is corporate, but it's not about Disney's ownership stake, it's about Marvel's org chart. In 2015, Disney moved Marvel Films out from under Marvel CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Perlmutter is still in charge of the TV series, while Kevin Feige, who runs the film division, no longer reports to Perlmutter. That's the main reason there's so little crossover between the TV series and the films at this point: professional and creative differences between Perlmutter and Feige. My understanding is that the new Marvel series slated for Disney+ are under Feige's umbrella rather than Perlmutter's, which is why they're using major characters from the films.
I hope it DOESN'T look like he's got a real budget, but instead keeps that VHS 80's camp look. Rumors of this have been around since the original short came out, but real confirmation for the project MAY have made me squee IRL.
Great news. Hopefully publisher funding won't stop them from releasing it DRM-free and on Youtube like they did with Kung Fury 1.
I am of course interested, but also trying to temper my expectations a bit. The original was, to me, the greatest action-comedy film of all time. It knew what it was, it didn't take itself seriously in the least, and if anything the short duration and bad effects were features rather than limitations. It packed 2 hours' worth of awesome into 30 minutes, skipping all the dumb minutiae and spacing that people watching action-comedies don't care about. So yeah, pencil me in to see the feature-length film, but it's hard to see how the perfection that is the original can really be improved upon. We'll see.
I would guess that trying to recreate Kung Fury's quick action, silliness, and charm in a feature length film is going to be a challenge. The short form allowed for skipping a lot of the usual plot building and characterization that keeps a feature length film humming along. Hopefully it rides the line of deliberately campy without being exhausting or too fantastical.
What the actual FUQ.
It can work. T is for Turbo: Turbo Kid was a short that helped the film makers get the kickstarter funding for their full length feature Turbo Kid. Turbo Kid turned out great. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBL0vPheNwM T is for Turbo short (NSFW) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFlZ6pVtnv0 Trailer for the feature length Turbo Kid (NSFW)
Something along the lines of Big Trouble in Little China would work. Over-the-top action, low-budget VFX that fit the feel of the film, enough comedy and in-jokes to get you to overlook the acting, etc. This could be a fun summertime flick!
Can they put Thor Lebowski in this? Please?
Kung Fury makes me laugh every time I watch it. I'll pay to see the sequel if only for that.
Agree - the Turbo Kid feature was great, here's hoping the Kung Fury feature clings to its roots so well.
I'll probably see it, but somehow I doubt it'll evidence the total lack of shits given that made the first one so good. To be fair, though, I am always nervous about sequel syndrome.
Adding Arnold is a strong move. He knows his place in action movie history and loves it. If they do it right, he hams it up like Last Action Hero but sillier. Hope it works out.
I wonder if Arnold is doing this because he needs a Lamborghini.
I don't know why he'd do that here, all the ones in these movies explode.
Just like real life!
Hm. I’m from Bulgaria and used to work for 10 years in the movie industry ( got up to a 1st assistant director for local movies and 2nd AD in foreign ones) My personal opinion is that most (not all but like 99%) of the movies shot here are mediocre at best. I hope this one will be an exception. Haven’t followed “the scene” the last 7 years, maybe things got better. Edit: I’ve added “maybe things got better” for clarification Last edited by LexSP on Tue May 21, 2019 4:36 pm
FTFY
Kung fury was great, but I felt like if it was even 5 minutes longer, it would have been much worse. I’m hoping he can recreate the magic that made the first one so good! Shooting open the car door was one of my favorite parts!
The plot better involve a trip to Japan to find a lost father... Also the music from the original deserves a big shoutout. Makes me smile every time it comes up in shuffle. Hope they can bring in some of the other great synthwave artists that have emerged since then (plus The Hoff of course)
The best part of watching Kung Fury was Netflix suggesting that I might also like to watch Look Who's Back, which turned out to be one of my absolute favorite films in recent memory.
It's so presciently weird that was made in 2015.
Fantastic news! I hope they keep the design of the original and don't ruin the look by having too high of a budget. Ideally, this should be an anthology of chapters in the Kung Fury universe.
Seriously? No love for Barbarianna, there's a whole song about her!
Yes! Tank you, David Sandberg, for pushing on to make a second one!
Aw yeah! I hope""Blood Dragon"" is referenced!
Error! Hacking too much time.
Kung Fury's failure to win at Cannes is proof of its quality.
You know what I will do when it comes out? MY JOB. (that is, watch it, and hope for more laser raptors)
Agree completely with the above sentiment except the indicated need to ""overlook the acting, etc."" The cast of Big Trouble in Little China maintained precisely the exact level of acting cheesiness, corniness, (fill in the blank) to provide the full and proper effect needed to secure the film's cult classic status.

As long as it's a Countach
I love how this sentence completely undersells how supremely odd Kung Fury was. I mean, yes, it's all accurate but totally leaves out *hand waves* everything else. Like being hacked back in time to stop Hitler from getting the power of Kung Fu is the most sensible part of the whole thing.
That was a pretty fucking awesome 29 minutes
If Arnold Schwarzenegger is starring in it, they almost certainly will need a real theatrical release in order to pay him. It might eventually go free on YouTube, but I would not expect it to start there.
I wonder if it'll end up anything like Kung Pow: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Pow!_Enter_the_Fist Basically just a collection of gags in a full length film.
YES!! Kung Fury is so ridiculous its AWESOME! Hoping they stay true to the 80s cheesiness and VHS-style video quality.
I don't mind paying for it, as long as it will come out digitally and DRM-free. I don't care about theatrical release, and I don't think producers should make it precede digital one either, like it's commonly done by legacy publishers. Let them already sync up with times and release digitally on day one.
One way it might work out is if they make several jumps through time. each period could fit together like a smaller version of the first movie, but with all the clichés typical for the period they are in.
Kung Fury is one of the greatest movies ever to exist
20 minutes in, just as the action is heating up, it goes fuzzy and starts showing the 3rd quarter of the Superbowl or someone's grad ceremony or maybe the season finale for Dallas. Then cuts back to movie with a room full of knocked out bad guys and a line about how they finally succeeded in doing that legendary kick-ass move that no one has ever seen before.
Wot if ya mum ran on batteries?
Have the writers/producers ever shared if there's a season-defining theme? I wonder if Season 6 would venture into a particular theme, or just kinda go wherever Netflix tells them is the trend for audiences?
The middle episode sounds dumb, although I can’t ever get enough Andrew Scott. And who knows—Black Mirror trailers have always tended to be a bit cagey and cryptic... for all I know, the middle episode could turn out to be another “San Junipero”.
Looks like even more of the same from the last two seasons. They've taken the conceit of brain-computer interfaces (whether mobile devices or more direct) and flogged it to death. I'm kinda done with Black Mirror at this point if that's all they have.
Ok, I'm sold. Guess I'll re-up Netflix for June or July...
Only 3 episodes??? And what's with the Americanization of this show? Bah.
Television reinvented. Charlie Brooker - I love you!
Er, do you remember how many episodes per series (season) it had when it was on Channel 4?
Love the series. Fresh air comes from Europe. Thank you, GB.
Very cautiously optimistic. Season 2 was somewhat of a mess, but it had its moments. Jeffrey Wright is phenomenal. The teaser doesn't really show much. Last edited by MaskDeMasque on Mon May 20, 2019 1:54 pm
Aaron Paul?
(If Dolores is no longer inhabiting Charlotte's body, who is?) Interesting how you've skipped over the obvious. She could easily just be another copy of Dolores. Any program can be copied, and any number of copies can exist. With a wide variety of bodies to choose from, Dolores could be many of them. I wonder what they talk about?
It felt like a very early teaser. I'm assuming they just needed a trailer to follow the finale of GoT and don't have any meaningful footage yet.
Indeed Season 2 lost it's way. The ""battle"" scenes specifically were childishly comical. This looks like a bit of a new direction being hinted at
I don't know about you, but I'm looking more forward to His Dark Materials. Looks like it is being done RIGHT.
Interesting to say the least. Did they get Chappy to do a cameo?
I love what I see! It would be shame if Westworld would say in ""parks only"" stories. There is huge world out there to explore with all good and bad that goes with it. I cant wait!
They totally ran out of stuff to do in the amusement park, and it showed. The new direction has me intrigued, the core characters (Bernard, Dolores, William, Hale and Ford) are still interesting enough, despite the S2 mess(es).
IMHO season 2 of Westworld was every bit as good as season 1. Looking at the comments it seems this is the minority view. I feel that new locations and new characters will help season 3 along, whatever your view of the previous one. I'm as intrigued to see what their vision of the real world of the future is as much as what happens to the characters.
The WW cameo we all really want is Tricia Helfer... But the world can only handle so much fan service.
There can be only one
This fucking show could be SO GOOD, and wants to be SO GOOD, and got lost in the weeds trying to play Lost-style nine-dimensional-chess games with timelines. Look at The Expanse: a TV show can tell a big complex story in a comprehensible, straightforward way and still rock. You don't need to make your viewers prepare timeline diagrams to entertain the shit out of them and make them think. Making them prepare timeline diagrams isn't going to trick them into thinking your needlessly convoluted story is a narrative masterwork, either.
There can be only one. Seriously, putting the Highlander in this world would be interesting.
Personally I was disappointed with the second season. The part in the japanese park felt like it brought nothing to the story (outside of some forgettable character development). And while the plot had some strong moments - the scene where the company owner's son needs to guess which is the android in the midst of the party comes to mind - it felt convoluted for the sake of being convoluted, unlike the 1st season where it was nicely interwoven and everything became clear once you got to the twist. I don't think it was necessary to (almost) randomly shuffle scene order just to make it feel slightly similar to the first season. With all that said, I'm still somewhat hopeful for this new season.
im surprised they didnt give up after s02, im feeling way more excited about altered carbon, and we have the expanse so whatever, ww s01 was too good to be real and now reality seems to have taken way, sadly
Westworld Season Two was one of the most confusing storylines I've ever seen. A show that can weave interesting timelines into a cohesive narrative is worth the commitment, but unless Westworld Season Three can figure out a narrative purpose of overlapping timelines, I'll sit this story out for good.

That scene on the girder made me long for a live action Fry and Bender sitcom.
A lot of us enjoyed trying to figure out the puzzle.
Two seasons in and I still don't know what I think about Westworld.... It's undoubtedly entertaining and generally holds my interest but, while I can appreciate the old Pulp Fiction out of whack timeline game, it almost seems stuffed so far down my throat that it can cause me to lose interest because you miss one small detail and things stop making sense. Still like the show, the acting is great, the premise is solid, there's good stuff all over the place...but sometimes I feel the timeline shifting leaves me unable to pay attention to all the good because I'm so concerned with missing some small piece of minutiae.
+1. I was very much reminded of Memento, an earlier work of Jonathan Nolan's, when watching season 2, and I loved every minute of it. If you haven't seen Memento, go watch it, then re-watch season 2. You may find a new appreciation for that style of story-telling. If you've already seen Memento and still don't like season 2 (or didn't much like Memento in the first place), then this might not be the show for you. As long as Jonathan Nolan is working on the series and as long as he continues to write and direct as he has in the past, you're not going to get linear ""turn-your-brain-off"" television. You're going to get something complex, nuanced, and at times a bit confusing.
Doesn't look like anything to me.
I liked S1, grew bored and didn’t finish S2, can’t say this trailer entices me to return for S3. My main turnoff was their turning Delores into a bloodthirsty murderbot.
Confusing doesn't necessarily mean complex, nuanced, or good.
Is this Logan Paul's lesser-known brother?
I can't watch at work, but I'm curious as to why the robot is taking a break with Aaaron Paul.
Game of Thrones at least had a couple or five centuries. Last edited by pipe13 on Mon May 20, 2019 2:58 pm
That's nothing compared to how long M*A*S*H lasted vs. the actual Korean war. edit: OK, maybe it isn't.
Unlike, say, another blond HBO protagonist, Dolores' heel turn feels much more earned and believable. There was never any hint that the eventual robot revolution was going to be bloodless; if anything, the writing was on the wall ever since the reveal of Arnold's fate. However, S2 did lose me with the Samurai World arc that went exactly nowhere, serving only to pad out the main story arc (which was overly plodding and nowhere near as compelling as the first season). Will I come back for S3? Maybe I'll wait for reviews before re-subbing; GOT's ending has lost me my confidence in HBO's commitment to story.
Please quote the sentence where I stated that complex meant nuanced or good so that I can correct it.

Westworld season 2 was so awful. Why????? Seriously, season 2 could have been ended on the first episode. Everything after was pointless bloviating, so the show should have cut the crap, told us what happened, and got on with the real interesting tidbits that may happen in season 3(which should have been season 2). Damn it, writers. Why'd you have to do this to us?
Her creators, the actions of humans or the writers of the show?
It wasn't so much confusing as it was utterly pointless. Flashy time manipulation can't make up for poor storytelling. And lack of characters we care about. I frankly didn't care about a single character in season 2, so what was the point?
I was excited for a minute... not that Aaron Paul is bad, but the tone that Adrian Paul's acting could have brought intrigued me.
Exactly. The writers actually stated that attempting to outwit the reddit theorycraft/speculation hivemind was one of their objectives when writing season2. As a result the season was a convoluted mess that tripped over itself and offered nothing compelling. They didn't adhere to the fundamentals (ignore the noise, focus on story/characters) and it showed.
One of the stupidest things they did was introduce the little brain marbles. In season one that wasn't a concept at all, the entire robot (at least the head) had memory and programming, which was why they had to repair the same bodies, why they bothered retiring bodies, etc. The idea that you can just swap out the robot brain with a little marble means there was never a reason to retire an entire robot body whenever the brain/host had an issue. This important limitation, the host brain being so connected to the host body, is necessary for various season one plot devices. Dolores realizing her father had been replaced (otherwise they would have reused the same body and just swapped the brain marble out), or the hooker bot being able to find her daughter. Or even having hosts wake up while being repaired, rather than just having brain-less bodies in the repair shop and putting the host brains into ready-to-go bodies for easy deployment. I figure the only reason they introduced the idea of being able to remove the brain in a marble-sized device was for the eventual ""escape"", but it's frustrating when fiction doesn't follow its own rules. It just makes so many other parts of the show seem absurd, rather than interesting and clever. Last edited by nedscott on Mon May 20, 2019 4:35 pm
I mean, maybe so, but the puzzle itself was shit. It wasn't a difficult puzzle because it was a complex picture and lots of pieces looked similar and you needed to really engage to solve it. It was a puzzle where you got handed the pieces one by one, by someone cutting them out with a rusy X-Acto knife on the fly, with the specific goal of frustrating you. The story is king, it's always king, and they got off in the weeds trying to jerk around the audience rather than tell the audience a good story. Still way too in love with their own cleverness, still not focused enough on telling a story.
I'm content. The last couple seasons were kind of a rough ride, real uneven, rushed feeling, all over the map. Hot and cold, map jumping, odd decisions, it could test your patiences at times. But the way it all wrapped up, even if it not as well set into motion as I might have liked? I'm good with it. The arcs feel right. The ending montages satisfied me. The writers were left without the books to guide them, and did the best they could with a tangle of thorns. And maybe others might have done better, I think we all have ideas we might have liked to have seen happen instead. But for me what really counts is that the end got to a point I could feel good about, and that means I can let it go. It wasn't perfect, but it was a hell of a ride, and I'm glad I took the journey, and there's plenty to reflect on. I choose to be happy about what I enjoyed, let what wasn't as good be food for thought, and not be mad about anything.
I have opinions on tonight's finale.
It was OK, not great not terrible.
At least we have a definitive ending. So many shows either vanish suddenly (think Firefly) or wind their way to a deliberately vague or outright weird ending (Lost, Battlestar Galactica). I do strongly agree with one thing the article said, something I've found difficult to articulate. This series in its later seasons (after the books ended) have felt more like filmed outlines than fully fleshed out episodes.
Spoiler: show God I wanted to stab Grey Worm in his pretentious smug face. Blindly following Dany in committing mass murder. Yeah, Jon was no better for blindly following the cunt like a dog on a leash. But at least in the end he saw through it. And got banished to Castle Black for it. While that no balled prick gets to sail away free. There should be a bounty on the head of every The Unsullied. What they did for the Night King war be damned. They threw out that 'get out of jail free' card. As many have said. I can not wait for Game of Thrones: Brotherhood. Last edited by necrosis on Mon May 20, 2019 1:50 am
Bran sat the entire season out basically as a baked potato. We deserved better.
Having the shortened season wasn't just a bad decision, it was a disastrous one. Dany's heel turn, while certainly hinted at, wasn't even remotely earned, jumping from being pretty level headed if firm and unyielding to being genocidal. Cersei was completely wasted, losing her one redeeming quality (caring for her children) because there wasn't time to show it. Cleganebowl lasted about 6 minutes and didn't have any emotional release to it. It was also frustrating how Dany's army kept respawning. We see the vast majority of the Dothraki killed during the Battle of Winterfell, then suddenly we're back to having a horde (alongside some inconsistent-with-the-show talk about losing half the riders). We pan out during this last episode on an army of Unsullied as big as (if not bigger than) what she originally 'purchased'. But ultimately, this episode was just evidence of how incredibly rushed the season was. Bran becomes king after about five minutes of discussion for....reasons? The North, similarly, gets independence even though they don't care about it nearly as much as say, Dorne, or The Iron Islands. Dany's army is apparently just fine with all of this, and head home after failing to kill Jon on first sight. Drogon, an intelligent creature, melts a chair instead of killing Jon after he murders Dany. Ugh. It was just a massive let down. After a lot of twists and turns, we lost some characters (some in incredibly stupid deaths, like Jaime and Cersei who refused to move ten feet to their left), the North got independence it really wasn't looking for (that whole thing seemed forced; Sansa's demanding it but most of the Northmen are dead after the war of the five kings and the battle of winterfell.) Giving this episode (or season) any kind of pass is frankly difficult for me to understand.
Personally, I'm hoping for Arya the Explorer.
I completely agree. I started with season 1 all the way back in 2012 (bought the 1st season on Bluray after reading a review on this site!) and saw the last episode tonight. Was a thrill ride from beginning to end even if the later seasons had a bumpier road.
Bran is easily the weakest link in the whole story. If they continued his arc, showed him leveraging his gifts for the greater good, illustrating how his newfound wisdom would make him a good, strong leader, it would justify his ascension to the throne. Instead, he was mostly used for scenery decoration, sitting around, occasionally feigning this nonchalant, so enlightened I'm above your petty concerns shtick when he's bothered enough to do anything at all. I guess everyone thought he'd make a good choice for king mostly because he's so stoner chill and non-offensive. Hail Bran the Broken, first of his name. Lord of the Andals, ruler of the 6 kingdoms, and something of an apathetic lump.
Not everything was wrapped up. What were the white walkers, who was the night King, why everything about them? And no, ""the children made them"" isn't remotely sufficient. What's up with the Lord of light? He real? Can we get a bit of anything? Even Davos wanted to know what was up with that guy. What's that magical explanation of why the seasons are all out of whack? It'd be nice to know... Also: Can Bran see the future? It's been hinted at. And if he can, did he foresee everything from the long night to becoming King well before it happened? Was the defense of Winterfell so ineptly handled specifically to put everything into position so that the best outcome could occur? IS BRAN THE LORD OF LIGHT? There is much unresolved.
> As the men of the Night's Watch are wont to say at a brother's passing, ""And now our watch is ended."" And as Hollywood producers would say ""and now begins [up to] 3 spinoff series"". At least one is likely to be about Arya Stark sailing west of Westeros. Another is likely to be a prequel, ""Dunk & Egg"". How much was the finale influenced by setups for spinoffs?
While not as terrible as the Lost finale it wasn't far off.... At least John has Tormund to keep him warm at night... Last edited by windnwar on Mon May 20, 2019 2:09 am
And there was yet another out-of-time goofup. A plastic water bottle on the ground at someone's feet during the ""conference to determine the future of Westeros."" You'd think after three such goofs in three consecutive episodes, they'd have had multiple interns scour every frame of the show with a fine-toothed Photoshop loupe.
All that mattered was that John gives Ghost a good neck scratch.
Ugh. How the writers managed to make so many character's resolutions simultaneously disappointing is a minor miracle. After nearly a decade, I'm trying to come up with a character arc that isn't weak and I am struggling. Yes, it can all be explained on some level, but that's a terrible gauge of decent writing. Had HBO cancelled the series a year or two ago at least I would have hope.
I was never super invested in GoT. There was a good amount of high points and equal amount of low points in the show. It’s the best fantasy show I’ve seen on television yet it was best when the fantasy elements were minimal. Like others have said the final season felt rushed but I was not overly elated or disappointed by any of their final character arcs except for one. Bran the Disinterested. His flat affect since becoming 3 eyed bird was disturbing. It reminded me of people with schizophrenia or depression. I’m not exactly sure what kind of direction they were giving him but it felt all wrong to me. He seemed apathetic about his impending death at the hands of the whitewalker king. He never really gave any sage advice, he merely relayed things he saw in his visions. He seems like an awful choice as a ruler. Edit: Also, I had to chuckle a bit when Tyrion, while still in chains, made the off-the-cuff remark that rulers no longer inherit the throne and will now be chosen by lords of the land and all of them said to themselves, “cool, cool, cool.” They laughed off Sam with his notion of democracy and instead thought this was a better solution? They didn’t want to take a beat and think about the repercussions of such a huge change to their form of government. They didn’t really feel the need to consider that if they thought this was the best method for choosing a monarch, that maybe others might feel this would be a good method for choosing a lord or lady?

I've come to the conclusion that, once you accept the fateful decision that S.7 & 8 were to be greatly shortened, the results—which are fairly poor; and just wretched by GoT's previously established standards—are still about as good as you can get. There really wasn't a better way to cram so much plot into so little time, especially when you consider the sheer number of dramatis personae. Once you made that one dreadful blunder, the die was cast and you could never have escaped the unpleasant consequences. There wasn't time to build proper foundations for Arya's abrupt disposal of the Night King, which in the context thoroughly deserved the deus ex machina criticism leveled at it. There wasn't time for the characters around Dany to sample her nascent insanity or to better illustrate her descent into Full Targaryen. There wasn't time, it appears, to fill the (unbridgeable) credibility gap yawning between Dany's demise and the teleportation of our cast of chums to elect a new king. It's not so much that events haven't always been either absurd or surprising, or both, in GoT: it is that previously GRRM lavished plenty—some would argue, too many—words on providing background, character motivation and rationale. With that scaffold of credibility-building gone, the show has collapsed under its own weight. I was taken in by Benioff & Weiss's original claim, many years ago, that they had ""always thought"" the series worked out at 73 episodes. They had seen GRRM's final synopses, so they ought to know, right? But they were fibbing. Whatever combination of actors' contracts, costs, boredom or laziness made them decide to cram everything into so few episodes, it is clear from watching the finale—watch any ten minutes of the finale, even—that the material deserved at least two full seasons. The result has been growing disenchantment. And of course, in light of the series' previous excellence, it is an exceptionally stark and painful disappointment. I almost hope that there were serious, practical reasons why the last two seasons had to be shortened. Because if, instead, this occurred simply because B&W were bored, or lazy, or couldn't write decent dialogue without GRRM's text to rely on—well, this isn't just a pitiable disappointment ... it is an entirely avoidable, unnecessary one. But: given that these seasons were produced no more rapidly than the previous ones, ""serious, practical"" reasons are very hard to see. So it really does look very much as if GoT's conclusion was screwed up for weak, even rather dishonest reasons ... and that's a dreadful waste.
With massive budgets and shorter seasons come dissatisfaction? It sure seems that way with a lot of TV series now. I had the same ""What the!?"" expression at the end of ST:Discovery's second season and I'm having the same with GoT now. The writers and showrunners spend so much time on action set pieces that they forget to set things up properly for a dramatic payoff. Things happen because the Plot Gods deem it so and character development is deemed unnecessary. To me, it seems Dany's dark side moment was completely unearned. She has always had more empathy than cruelty so it makes no sense for her to turn into a genocidal maniac in a single episode because... her dad was crazy?
That's not fair. Even the cream of the crop of current Hollywood actors would have struggled to convey the character evolution necessary in so little time on screen. I heartily agree with those that say that all (or at least by far the most) of the issues of the final two seasons come from two things: Too little time to build up and the lack of GRRM worldbuilding behind the action sets.

You think Hollywood doesn't cast on physical appearance and willingness to take clothes? I haven't heard any complaints about the acting - except for yours, if that's what you're complaining about. Every criticism I've read has landed solidly on the writing, and nothing else.
The last two seasons feel like a book abridgement. Enough to work out what’s going on, and enjoyable passage-by-passage, but not entirely satisfying. I guess that bodes well for sales of the final two books when they are finally released, but somewhat tarnishes what should have gone down in history as the centrepiece of the current golden era of TV.
I am fine with the wrap as well. The pre battle episodes could have done with some more oomph, but whatever, a long journey to get there. The Battle of Winterfell was glorious, just glorious. I liked that she reverted to her Targaryen nature in the end. Let there be fire! Poor Jon Snow, there and back and then there again. The best part for me was that final small council meeting where the game of thrones just starts right back up again. No scratch that, it was a feeling of joy as the living marched north in a horde, mirroring the dead that drove them out with just a hint of warming sunlight breaking through the trees.
I like where *most* of the characters ended up, I'm just not completely satisfied by how they got there. I liked Arya's big moment in episode 3, but I felt they absolutely wasted her in episode 5. I think it would have been better if she'd sat the episode out like Sansa. Also, what was with the horse? There was no confirmation if Brandalf sent Shadowfax to rescue her, or if the horse was just a giant narrative convenience. Speaking of Bran, I didn't like his ending. I preferred to think of him cleverly moving pieces from the shadows. Like, did he know Arya would kill the Night King when he gave her the very instrument in the exact spot she'd deliver that killing blow... I understand the narrative direction of Dany's character, but I wonder if Emilia knew 20+ months ago Dany would die because with the beginning of this season it felt like she was playing a different character. She was far more hostile and abrupt (in my opinion of course) than in the prior season.
I assume she was told to play the character as more abrupt, hostile and violent to try to justify the eventual flip to full on genocide. I don't know if the actors knew the full season arc or if they were told episode-by-episode, but no matter what they'd have wanted her to dial up those emotions from the beginning of the season. That's just not enough to flesh out the change, and it all falls back on poor writing and execution by the team behind the series. Someone compared the last two seasons to abridged versions of books, and that's exactly right. Like the writers had this list of important plot points but nothing to tie them together because the books weren't written, and they weren't up to the task of tieing them together themselves.
It really felt like the entire last season they just said aw, fuck it, we're done and went around shutting off a couple of lights each episode. Night King? Click. Cersai? Click. Dany? Click. Just click click click, even with the characters that didn't die.
Meh. It was too long of a wrap up is my first reaction. There's a lot I'm happy with, and a lot I'm not. The Good: - Jon Snow killing Daenerys was perfect. As it should be. - Tyrion mourning over his sister and brother...perfect. - Small council meeting fade out was perfect. - The large council deciding the next king was appropriate - Sansa ending up as Queen of the North in a separated kingdom was appropriate. - The iron throne being melted was spot on. - The overall arc of the story ended correctly. The Kingdom grinds on. Minor things have changed. However, despite all of the warmongering, dragonfire, white walkers, intrigue, etc, all that happens in the end is a particular throne is melted, and we choose a king a bit different. Life will just trudge along, as it always has. 8 seasons of blood, ice, and fire... and this is all that's accomplished. Excellent. The Bad - Brandon Stark as King. It makes technical sense. Theoretically I'm not against it, but he's lifeless, and has been a sack of potatoes the past few seasons. I just don't buy the ""story"" lines we were fed. He didn't have enough of a role lately to justify it. - Arya's ending. It made sense to a point, but was seriously anti-climatic. I can think of so many better directions that could've gone. How about hinting she's going back to Braavos- an unended story arc? Something, anything. A generic off to explore just doens't cut it for me. - The lack of hints of potential White Walker future issues sucked. We had a whole episode opener showing the White King turning a baby. TIE THIS UP! The Ugly - The Unsullied just up and leaving. After they made a claim to the city. Not getting a voice in the council vote. Just.. oh, yeah, we're going back because... WTF?! - SUDDENLY SNOWING IN KINGS LANDING WTF WHY WTF WHY?!?!?!?!?! That's WAY too heavy to be ash, it's snow (as shown when the dragon melts the throne, it melts away a bit)... but wut?! - Drogon just up and leaves. WTF?!?! Jon Snow is a fucking Targaryen! I get that Drogon showed him deference and respect by not roasting him then and there, but WTF?! We've had no particular specific dragon intelligence shown until now, suddenly it looks like Drogon will suddenly tell Jon ""I'm the Last of my Kind..."" out of nowhere, but he just up and leaves. WUT?! - WHY IS THERE NO TRIAL FOR JON? WHY ISN'T THE FACT THAT HE IS A FUCKING TARGARYEN DRUG OUT IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE COUNCIL?!?! For all the things they did show, this is kind of a critical point of the whole series to ignore. FFS. Final thoughts: Overall, I give it a 6/10. Mostly good wrap up, but could've been 20 minutes shorter and not missed a damn thing.
I liked it. I don't see what everyone is so upset about...
Why would Drogon kill a Targaryen? Like the last one. Make sense man. What he did was totally murderize the throne that got his stepmom killed. Why did Bran become king? The former power became bacon, and bacon does not vote. Because the North held all the power at that point and the other power, under Grey Worm had no stake in the decision. He is a follower. And then a leaver, with the unsullied and dothraki in ships, sailing, to some place. There was no moving 10 feet to their left. They were found high on a pile of rubble which means they got swept sideways in a debris flow. Anyway, you assume too much about the big picture based on the tiny viewpoint of the camera. It's ok not to like it. Just don't try to justify a piece of entertainment based on physics or whatever. It makes no sense, just enjoy the dragons.
Yep. That's exactly the point I was trying to make. The writers & show-runners, due to bad writing or a desire for secrecy (or both) didn't give her the tools needed to make the character change feel earned.
I would watch that.
That shot of Dany with the dragon taking off behind her was perfect, to the extent that I would call it the most cinematic visual in the entire series.
I like your thinking. On that note, did you know that Jaqen is actually the god of death? Watch the scene where he gives Arya the coin. He turns around and pretends to remove his nice face. But his hair never moves. Then he turns around and there is grey hair. Magic! He is a god! Why would he even have been on that continent if he was just some priest. Yep he wouldn't, but he was, because Arya needed training and she had a very special name to take that was not even on her list.
The end of GoT probably burned off a lot of the goodwill that would have helped the spin-offs be successful. Add in AT&T wanting to squeeze as much short term profit from HBO's reputation with ""quantity over quality"" (mis)management and I'm not hopeful.
May the good Lord take a likin' to ya and blow ya up real soon.
Saw it this morning, and it was excellent. I’m not entirely sure how I feel about the cliffhanger-ish ending, but I’m absolutely down for a fourth installment. And Halle Berry’s fight scene with the puppers and Reeve was probably my favorite in the whole film. Please come back for more, Halle!
It’s not just the fighting, it’s also the master class in lighting and cinematography. Come for the goofy bunches of continuous fight scenes, stay for some really beautiful camera work. This is the first John Wick movie I’ve seen in a theater, and it had the audience eating out of its hand. I think half the audience said “guns, lots of guns” out loud in sync with Reeves. It’s just that kind of movie. Edit: I will ask one question though? Just what the hell is going on with all those crystal brains in display cases, other than being constant targets for the actors face (well, and also for being beautifully lit and shot)? When it happened for like the fifth time I was laughing SO hard. Last edited by Peevester on Sat May 18, 2019 6:47 pm
Never heard of this. Looks good. I have no clue how I missed the first two films I kinda like Keanu Reeves.
I actually liked the second film more than the first. The first one annoys me by starting off with what is essentially a variation on the ""stuffed in the fridge"" trope. Whenever I rewatch the film I skip the beginning. The second one was far stronger overall despite the fact that I found the ending not very satisfying. Fingers crossed this one is as solid as the second with a more satisfying ending.
It must be a sign of the times, since I've never heard of John Wick at all in any context, when looking at the image at the top of the story, I thought, ""I wonder if Keanu Reeves is gonna sue for having his likeness in that video game."" That looks so much like a vid cap of a video game it's scary.
The first movie had the feel of a Max Payne game with more headshots
Fight scene. Bridge. Fight scene. Bridge. Recovery. Fight scene. Motion scene interrupted for another fight scene. Bridge. Expository pause. Fight scene. And so on.
The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is superb, the characters are memorable, and the fight choreography is imaginative and expertly acquitted. Run time is 131 minutes, but you'll barely notice it go by, but nothing really feels rushed. I'm really looking forward to the next installment.
I think this is the ultimate form of the action film. Minimal plot, huge unending fight sequences, amazing production quality. Like, it is catering to not only my needs but my wants as well. Yeah that room was weird. Maybe this is a Keanu science fiction series after all? But what gorgeous visuals. Also, kudos on the adjudicator, a fabulous actor from the equally fabulous Billions series on TV.
Is it just me that found many of the fights off on timing? I kept noticing actors, often Keanu, waiting for the next move to come to him - just long enough for it not to seem fluid. This was not something I noticed in the first one at least, and I'll have to re-watch the second to check.
Do not worry. That picture looks like it is a screen capture of a chinese dvd of an illegal video of a screening using a bad projection system viewed from a poor seat. In the actual movie the details are amazing and have that expensive full metal quality thing going on. Nothing will make you think this is a video game except the body count.
I saw it Thursday night. The reviews I saw said it fell sorta flat in the third act, and I agree. The goals of Wick seem to get muddled in the third act, too. I will also say that the fight scene involving Hally Berry and Keannu together goes on a tad too long, you could comfortably cut some of it out in the middle and not loose anything. I must say that I hope other directors are watching, and taking note of the audience reaction. Note, directors, how there is no hint of shaky cam anywhere in this movie. Do more of that. Especially you, future director of Borne movies. I await the inevitable body count videos on Youtube.
Whoot! Was waiting for this!
There was a couple moments when he was fighting Zero's brothers that he was hurting really bad, and they played that up with more off-time and exaggerated movements. I don't think a single thing in these movies is not planned.
Are you nuts? The Hally Berry and <star of the fight 1> and <star of the fight 2> and sometimes Keanu scene could have gone on for twice as long it was so full of awesome.
I'm going to have to differ on this. Those dogs, MAN are they well trained, doing the whole fallout dogmeat thing (grabbing onto and pinning people down so they can be easily dealt with) amidst all that chaos. I wonder how much of that is practical effects? It was spellbinding to watch.
Just FYI for John Wick fans. If you haven’t seen Hardcore Henry, it’s worth a look. Great action and stunt work, and an FPS perspective that makes you wonder why the hell video games that can invent entire set pieces no longer do stuff this interesting.
Not even in the same universe, let alone the same page.
I like the John Wick series but the third one had a little too much action for me, it felt like the fights dragged on endlessly. But i did like that there was more insight in how the criminal organization works. Hopefully if there is a 4th movie i hope they won't drag out the fighting. I'm guessing that Hallie will come back for the 4th one. John wick VS. The council of 12
Wow, some movie comes out of nowhere from a series I've never even heard of and apparently it's good? Looking forward to this! Weird now I've never even heard of this series before. Is it some super indie extreme cult classic thing that nobody's ever heard of? There's people here to seem to know what this is. Or is this a movie series for like, extreme moviephile hipsters? Genuinely curious. This came out of nowhere.
I'm hoping that the mute assassin from 2 will make a return, too. Her fights with Wick were too short, but her being allowed to live was interesting.
It's a mainstream movie that wasn't over-hyped for months for any of the three movies. It'd be easy to miss among the Disney fanfare around their movies and the Marvel movies.

I'm sure if any of it got explained it would ruin the effect - you're just supposed to WTF on it the first time you see it, and then just go with it from then on, and that's fine. It just reminds you ""oh yeah, what the fuck was going on there?"" when you see stills later. Quote: Also, kudos on the adjudicator, a fabulous actor from the equally fabulous Billions series on TV. It wasn't so much a part as a collection of hair-raising attitude in a collection of neat black suits, and yeah, the actor played it perfectly. That shot when Winston hangs up midsentence, SO good. It's interesting, I find I'm liking the movie even more as I think about it, and often the exact opposite is true.
I dunno man sounds like New York to me.
Pretty much. As one reviewer put it, ""This is a movie for those who found Taken too intellectual,"" and ""This film has four screenwriters credited - which seems like overkill."" It pretty much gets along without being encumbered by a plot, and jumps straight to the action and stays there. Nothing wrong with that. But you won't need your cerebellum; leave it at home and let it have a rest.
In this universe, there are competent professional assassins on every street corner instead of being a vanishingly small number of not very bright lackeys, and a globe-spanning organization of apparently millions of mobsters runs the world (on computers from the 80s). One of those things should tip you off that this isn't a documentary. In brief, lighten up, Francis.
""You ... uh ... ""working"" again?"" -- cop looking at a dead body, after Wick kills a bunch of people in his home in JW1. In this world, the cops cooperate with these people.
It's nowhere near the level of the Wick movies, but it's goofy fun.
Not at all! This series is the big come back for Keanu Reeves. Very famous and very popular. Even gets referenced in TV shows and other media pretty often.

The best part was how they telegraphed it in the earlier scene in the room, with Winston explaining how they only use it in special circumstances. I remember thinking ""they're going to break every single piece of glass in this entire goddamn room at some point, aren't they?"" And they did not disappoint.
And bloody good fight scenes they are too.
I never denied that. I did appreciate that although the fight scenes played out differently, there were some techniques that Wick relied on regularly, as opportunity presented itself. Driving an edged weapon into an opponent's heart or head with repeated blows, in particular.
I immediately started testing different pouring speeds with my pot of tea.
And yet again science occurs not due to a ""Eureka"", but a ""Huh,that's interesting...""
And for some reason this morning, my first thought was.. ""And Bloody Stupid Johnson has done it again..."" S
Provide a lip under the spout, similar to how counter worktops have drip grooves - liquid doesn't like dribbling up hill.
You can pour fast during the pour and there'd no dribbling, but some spouts fare better than others are preventing dribbling as you end the pour. Inevitably as you pull up the kettle, it's going to slow it down and in some kettles/bottles/spouts it always dribbles while some never/rarely do.
I haven't got that far, I'm timing how long the kettle takes to boil when I watch it.
Hmm, i’ve never seen a kettle do this, only teapots, gravy boats, jugs, and the like.
Not really a tea drinker (or enough of one to make more than a single cup if I'm having it), but, e.g., for pouring cream out into my coffee at a restaurant, I've found that taking your (clean) spoon and touching it to the spout as you pour mostly prevents dribbling (the cream pours down the spoon face instead of the side of the jug).
This is something that has been bugging me for ages, and which has discouraged me from buying a nice teapot. It's nice to know I'm not the only one. I had noticed that some teapots are more prone to dripping than others, and even different examples of the same make and model (last teapot I bought the shop keeper let me try out several with tap water, but I don't expect that kind of service again). In agreement with the article, I also found that too narrow a spout can be detrimental to a clean pour, for example, and even some very expensive pots, like the small, very pretty and utterly useless Wedgewood I was given as a gift, are guilty of poor quality control in that respect. (Edited for misspelling of teapot)
Thank you, science, thank you physics. Now, can you please help me with an even more pressing problem? What can you do about the puddles of water that accumulate in the concave bottoms of my upside down drinking glasses, soup bowls, and mugs, during the washing cycle of my dishwasher, and which is still there upon my opening of the door to put the clean (but still wet) dishes away, and which splashes all over the place when I retrieve the item from the tray, despite my being aware of this annoying phenomenon, having experienced it 17 kajillion times previously? Thanks! PS My cat thanks you too, since large droplets of water frequently land on the top of his head.
I had found out that the dribbling had something to do with the speed with which it flows out, but to make the tea go faster I had to tilt the pot so much the tea spilled from the top opening. Then I found that the air flow to the inside of the pot is important: if the little hole in the lid is clogged the air pressure inside the pot gets lower, hampering the flow. And last but not least, cleaning the pot also ensures the highest tea flow possible. So much for my home experiments. Finally I have to say that it's nice to see Saxion mentioned. They do a lot of work together with the University of Twente (they are practically next to each other here in Enschede) and this is the first time I see that they get the credit they deserve for it.
There has to be a better way! Spoiler: show
as a certified tea drinker and teapot user, often to ""pour faster"" you have to invert the teapot more, but the often squat body of the pot means the lid is lower than the lip so when you tip it, it will leak out the lid, and the leaves will clog the spout mesh/grille so you get an impeeded flow rate anyway. pour faster... not a valid option!
Physics cannot help you with this problem, but laziness can. Just leave the clean dishes in the dishwasher for a day and let the residual water evaporate.
Would it be completely unhelpful to suggest placing a towel next to the dishwasher when you start it up so that when it is time to empty it, you can grab the towel and sop up those puddles before you attempt to remove the dishes? (I can't claim credit for this, it was my mom's solution) If you want a fancy suggestion, you'll need to do something like invent a dishwasher that tilts the cups back and forth during the drying cycle, or blows intense jets of air to blast the water off the tops. I'm sure there is plenty of modelling you could do to perfect both options.
Untrue. The answer to infinite lifespan is quite simple and known to all: AVOID DYING
Science FTW.... Hopefully there are a selection of ""known good"" designs which potters and manufacturers can refer to, somewhere. Can excuse a dribble from a hand-crafted one-off, but manufacturers who mass produce dribblers deserve serious deduction of stars. I mean, to use the vernacular, ""haz prototyping?""
Some dishwashers and drying racks are poorly designed, they have you mount the bowls and cups vertically. Good dishwasher and drying racks you have mount the bowls and cups at an angle, there seems to be some dispute in the industry about what is a good angle but that ultimately comes down to what style of concave your dishes have. These design choices are important. Water, like all other mass is affected by gravity. The Earth's gravity wants to pull everything towards it. This means water can't flow uphill unless you impart enough energy to counter the effect of gravity. Simple solution, the angles of the concave are no more than PI/2 away from the dominant gravity direction vector. In other words, tip them enough so that the water can flow off and give them enough resting time to allow the water to flow off.
As a teenager playing at growing crystals, I remember a description of ""decanting"": To get a clean pour from one container to another, use a clean glass stirring rod to help guide the flow. Starting today, I will now refer to it as ""to give the liquid a surface to attach to"", and try to sound all smart. :-)
In related news, scientists at the Joint Research Centre's Analytical Laboratories for Food Science are closing in on understanding why a watched pot never boils.
wine disc proves that pour speed is only one factor in the dribble.
""Turn it off... Data, humans don't have internal chronometers..."" -Riker
I really do love how science has found these problems much more complicated that expected, but what I love more is that we're still finding situations like these in everyday experiences most of us (Ars readers even) don't think twice about. This article immediately reminded me of the one almost a year ago about breaking spaghetti.
I thought it was about incontinence.
Forget about stopping teapots dribbling [0] - I want them to explain how the person in the cover picture is levitating that teapot [0] though if you can do that for the cheap one person stainless teapots found in most cafes in the UK - and whose maximum flow rate appears to be below the rate required to prevent drips then you probably deserve a Nobel
So basically I should increase the flow rate to avoid dribbles that gets splashed back when it hits porcelain. Got it.
Interesting. My last two teapots have had little to no problem with this. However, I run into very often with my tempered glass measuring cups for cooking. In general it seems the Pyrex ones are slightly better than Anchor, but both are very prone to dribbling.
Ikea make cups and mugs with little notches on the base to solve this exact problem, but of course that's only a useful solution if you don't mind replacing everything with Ikea cups and mugs.
I remember that one. The comment section was a hoot. Certain personal methods for preparing pasta were met with smug insinuations that we were dealing with barbarians. Great fun.
Will this info be helpful when I get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom..? ... I'll let myself out.

For those interested, Yale has published a [url]photographic reproduction of the manuscript[/url] that's more than sufficient for anyone interested in taking a crack at deciphering it. My gut feeling is that those claiming it's a more recent hoax are correct.
""Proto-romance language""? You mean Latin?

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vulgar-Latin Proto-romance, sometimes called vulgar latin is different from high latin.
I want to read more about why Fagin Davis said this Quote: Just last year, Ahmet Ardiç, a Turkish electrical engineer and passionate student of the Turkish language, claimed (along with his sons) that the strange text is actually a phonetic form of Old Turkish. That attempt, at least, earned the respect of Fagin Davis, who called it “one of the few solutions I’ve seen that is consistent, is repeatable, and results in sensical text.” and also this Quote: (1) sound first principles; (2) reproducible by others; (3) conformance to linguistic and codicological facts; (4) text that makes sense; (5) logical correspondence of text and illustration. No one has checked all of those boxes yet."" And more about this turkish approach. Seems interesting.

Whatever the Voynich manuscript is, it is fascinating.
Couldn't it just be someone doodling? Maybe even under the influence of something?
It's either a modern fake (late 19C at least, possibly early 20th), or it's the result of an illiterate with hypergraphia and an obsession with the female body. (Or at least an obsession with the parallels between the sexual parts of plants and women.)
Actually vulgar latin would be common romance. So Latin would be proto-romance.
No, the ""idea"" is that this so called language came after Latin but before the split into French, Spanish and Italian. There no records of this language existing and when the Voynich manuscript was written, Dante had written the Divine Comedy in Italian 200 years before.
That's a lot of doodling; around 250 pages. It includes a lot of drawings, too. It's pretty well crafted, too, for someone stoned.
So you are saying Britannica is wrong?
Some internal inconsistencies in a translation should be expected. It's not like these folks had digital computers encoding their data for them. If it was written in a code, it's always possible a writer mis-coded a character. Nor is there any reason to expect self-consistent spelling even if it's not in a code. Look at the ""rules"" for spelling in English from the 15th century.
Is there really no way to distinguish a manuscript produced in 1438 from one produced in 1912? I don't speak dating tech, but didn't ink and paper technologies change drastically in the interim? Don't we know things a hundred years later about inks and paper production that would identify anachronisms?
A) You seem to have a word: ""Given that Gibbs' main claim to fame before this article was a series of books about , it seems that his goal in this research was probably to sell a television screenplay of his own."" B) Maybe I just missed it, but since there doesn't seem to be a link in the article, here's the manuscript: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cien ... ito07a.htm C) My bet has always been on it being a super old school Farmers Almanac kinda thing. But i'm not any sort of expert, so who knows. Last edited by iceph03nix on Wed May 15, 2019 4:56 pm

The ""paper"" (actually vellum, made from lambskin or similar) is definitely medieval. But a dealer in antiquities would have been able to get hold of that relatively easily. The ink is harder to age, and analysis is usually based on what it was made from, and again that's easy for someone with the right knowledge to fake. As to the reason for creating the fake, theories range from a deliberate attempt to humiliate Voynich, to a deliberate attempt by Voynich to make money/his reputation, to simple boredom.

The story is in all the British papers today as a real solution. This article is doing the opposite and pointing out the holes.
I view the Voynich Manuscript as a 15th century version of TimeCube, and one of the reasons it has resisted translation is that it was written by a crazy person. Although the Old Turkish (Anatolian?) angle is interesting.
In the right geeky circles, it is quite popular and interesting, so articles like this are newsworthy to many. I think Ars Technica and other tech/science/geek places are perfect articles for this. If its running on ""mainstream"" media, that may be a bit of a stretch. It definitely is something that has interested me for years just because of the oddity and novelty of it. It is strange and (seemingly) old and it is just too large and well-made of a document for many people to believe it is just some hoax.
It's already been explained ... https://xkcd.com/593/

The word ""vulgar"" here is synonymous to common. So vulgar latin is synonymous to common romance. Which makes the use of the phrase proto-romance language correct. From the article Quote: In addition, the fundamental underlying argument—that there is such a thing as one 'proto-Romance language'—is completely unsubstantiated and at odds with paleolinguistics. There isn't such thing as proto-romance.
The problem is that it makes no historical sense. In the 15th century the Ottomans were invading central Europe, where the manuscript was written. The Turks were using the Arabic script to write a more modern version. Why would anyone use an entirely new alphabet to write a dead version of Turkish, when contemporary Turkish was on the doorstep.
I wouldn't rule that out. I knew a guy in high school, lots of mental issues, who invented his own script and spooled off volumes of it in notebook after notebook; he was also obsessively secretive about it. I suspect it was a simple substitution-style cypher, but the symbols were not normal alphabet characters; they were his own creation. I suppose a statistical analysis would show that it was English-like, at least. I don't know if such an analysis has been done on the Voynich Manuscript, just to rule out it being pure gibberish.
I think you're right. A book dealer and antiquarian of the times could probably have gotten hold of some middle-ages parchment from the right age, and finding it had little intrinsic value BLANK, embellished it a bit. I don't know what kind of analysis they did on it, but chemically, it's easy to reproduce the inks and paints from the late middle-ages (and easier when this was ""discovered""), so that's not necessarily a thing. Parchment, too, can be found, or made, in the same manner. This kind of begs the question, did anyone do carbon dating on them or spectrographic readings to find trace elements consistent with the time of alleged creation, or even the time of the discovery? Or was its age determined by experts who understood what was used back then? So WHEN was that analysis of the age done? And has it been checked with more modern tools? Remember, for 41 years, the Piltdown Man was considered a true example of a pre-human hominid. And if people accept the age as previously determined without making sure with more modern tools of its composition, it's POSSIBLE this is an early 20th century fraud.
I suppose it couldn't be artistic gibberish. Right? A scam? A joke?
An itinerant calligrapher's sample book of 15th century Lorem Ipsum?
The analysis shows there is some sort of structure, indicating grammar and constant spelling but nothing matching an obvious language.
That is one way to interpret it but it appears to be a little more complex than that. Proto-romance language seems be a reference to the time in history in which vulgar latin (common latin) was transforming into the romance languages but before those new languages were in full existence. So 'Proto-romance language' likely refers to a loose collection of various versions of vulgar latin that were undergoing transformation over time into a more modern romance language. So there would be many 'proto-romance languages'. A scholarly researcher who finds a book that isn't following the rules of vulgar latin but also isn't following the rules of medieval French could label it a 'proto-romance language'. There would be many such languages. It seems more a term for classification than an actual reference to an individual language. It seems to be something like the 'Ur Text' usage in literary theory.
I guess this is Cyrus' chance to prove she's better than vacillating between Mickey Mouse club and hypersex. In either case, I hope this season is a little less one-note than the last one.

Despite the fact that Black Mirror's stories makes me really uncomfortable most of the time, I will watch the h*ck out of this season just as I have the previous seasons. I wish the stories were more far-fetched, but they're not. They're not.
I’m onboard with the short season model, provided that the stories and production design compensate. And a side benefit: short seasons leave the audience wanting more, staving off boredom with the product. Movie franchises have been doing this for ages. It took fifty years to amass a score of Bond 007 films, for example. Could you imagine the psychic fatigue of being bombarded with a superhero movie every six months?!
That's the point, but I think you know that. It's supposed to make you think about the unwanted ramifications of technology and how it can snowball out of control. The episode Snowdive, the ""social media rules society"" in particular was like looking into a Lovecraft abyss for me. How everything was so vein, shallow, superficial, and how the truly happy people were the ones deemed misanthropes because they did not go through their entire life wearing a kabuki mask stuffed full of poison ivy. We watched that in one of my night classes last year (social anthropology) and, surprise surprise, an Instagram addicted, teeth sucking young woman who sat in the back and was on her phone more often than not didn't get the point of it and hated it.

I partially blame Black Mirror for the unwanted end of my previous relationship. There were fundamental issues in our relationship, we wouldn't talk about it for fear of how the other would react, and we were watching Black Mirror together. We always felt awful afterwards, uncomfortable and fearful about the future, and yet we kept watching, just because it's so damn good.
You're right. It's a series. See also: Sherlock.
At this point Black Mirror and its writers have earned so much respect from me, I couldn't care less how many episodes are in a season. Whatever they feel works best for the stories they want to tell. I'd rather have 3 amazing episodes than 6 mediocre ones.
Amen, I'm looking forward to it so I can watch it with my kids and say 'see that is what you do to me with your constant wanting to be on your phone'.
It was for the first 2 .....
to be fair MRI's can be scary looking in normal lighting. hey I want to lock you into a coffin of loud whiring, clacking machinery and you have to hold really really still.
Same feeling here. I even agree with your assessment of the specific episodes (except Nosedive, I rather liked that one but largely because the star really drove home how alienating it is to fall out of grace). The whole direct brain/machine device bit has worn exceedingly thin after five or ten episodes flogging it to death, especially since The Entire History of You nailed it on the first go. I don't know why they insist on doing the same basic premise over and over again with different plots. I don't know if it's failing creativity on Brooker's part, which would be tragic, or the network demanding MOAR CONTENT and stretching out the writing team. I hope it's the latter, because that would mean shorter seasons might deliver a return to the peerless excellence of S1 and S2.
Maybe I'll try watching again. The relations-with-a-pig episode was a rather large turn off.
Black Mirror is doing the Lord's work for my disconnected generation.
Absolutely. S01E01 turned me off for a long time, 4 years I believe. I started season 4 and then worked my way back through each season. That's the order Netflix played them for me. I now love Black Mirror.
You're not visible to those who aren't looking. It surprises me that more people don't die in NYC from failure to be aware of their immediate, corporeal environment. I've eyed tweaked-out meth heads and half-dead heroin addicts in my proximity, and they at least have the perception and presence of mind to avoid walking into me. People on smartphones, nope. And then they apologize. I've actually stopped and stood still at a ten-foot distance as someone walked directly and obliviously toward me; he still walked directly into me as I simply stood there in plain sight. Like you, I'm not at all ""hard to see.""
Have to remember it was originally a British tv show, and they don't get turned off by the discussion of such things. We in the US tend to be kind of prudish in a lot of ways about discussing what we consider taboo topics. That's just a societal/cultural thing though. It's why the episode was so well reviewed in the UK because frankly it didn't shock them or make them uncomfortable. I mean you have to keep in mind that like 3 or 4 years later it came out that there was a possibility that the sitting Prime Minister had actually done something similar in college as part of hazing, and then of course you have Wales and Scotland (I jest).
I am not shocked at this. I mean, some actually being blameless and pointing finger elsewhere. A show is not responsible for your relationship issues: you are. The show is merely reflecting the probability and irony with fiction. If its close to home, you need to get help. I mean, that, sincerely.

No Pigs were violated in the making of this Season.
Hot take: What if technology was bad tho
Ah, so you're in the 'I'm so unique cause I see past the ''Technology bad !! So Edgy!!'' spiel. Even that has become a cliche in itself. I agree not all episodes are great and the basic concepts aren't always original but just because other people have been saying the same things doesn't make it 'not good or thought provoking'
For more far-fetched stories, you only need to follow current US politics; available for free on any network, everywhere on this planet.
I'm pretty sure Booker has commented that one of the show's biggest problems has been him coming up with a great idea, writing it, and halfway through production...what's posited in the show actually happens in real life.
It's not clear from this article, but are they planning on any more CYOA episodes? Bandersnatch was enjoyable enough.
Um so where is the good? I mean hell just look at the articles here on Ars. We have Uber and Lyft taking advantage of drivers, now luckily their share price is being reflected with that. We have Facebook, probably the largest social outlet in the world presently influencing elections, selling user private data, and generally being bad actors. Turns out they all actually have access to 70% of all of your credit card purchases and details. Game companies employing psychologists to increase addiction triggers and get people to buy skinner boxes. Everyone glued to their phone nearly 100% of the time. And now even the capability to shut down any device, even health care devices such as pace makers, remotely greatly increasing risk to people. So again where is the benefit? I mean other than the fact no one ever has to step foot outside their door to do pretty much anything.
Uh,... it's about the bad because that's what makes for interesting, compelling watching. A story about how Facebook was so helpful when aunt Thelma lost her poodle just isn't as good as pig fucking. Also, Netflix wants numerous episodes. If they went with the good about our connected society, they'd only have half an episode.
I'm perhaps being a little internet hyperbolic, but there's something about the show that consistently sticks me wrong, and it usually boils down to: either a rather rote take on the central thesis (""Nosedive"" grates me in particular); or they introduce a nugget of an interesting idea and then don't do anything about it (""hey look at this"" END EPISODE). But nothing will ever ruin my love of San Junipero
Was Cyrus in the Mickey Mouse Club? I know she starred in Hannah Montana on Disney and I think it was one of their most popular shows.
I used to watch (and enjoy) the Jerry Springer Show for the ridiculous farce. But no longer: since 2016, US politics is far more farcical than Springer.
If anyone is waiting for new Black Mirror episodes, maybe check out season 3 & 4 of Inside No 9.
Obviously you're not from Mississippi.
Looking back I think we'll all realize Season 3 was the best.
Well, shit! Here you go with the start of a story that's sure to be interesting and leave it at that? You and your partner had issues that were toxic to your relationship that !Black Mirror! touched on!? Inquiring minds want to know.
Not having to set foot outside our door is arguably the point... Many see this as being inside our house all day, not doing exercise, being antisocial, etc., (which can be also true in some instances, but not remotely all), but it also means being able to speak with your family without going broke or spending a loooot of time traveling, being able to work from home without wasting 5 hours on the car/train, being able to buy things that you couldn't otherwise, being able to save lives on time, having a lot of knowledge available about almost anything without having to basically travel the world to find experts, and a loooong etc. Also complaining to others about how horrible is our connected society via voluntary participation on such connected society, I guess? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The federal government won't change their marijuana laws until either Big Pharma gets some type of patent on THC, or RJ Reynolds switches over to growing marijuana instead of tobacco. Regardless of what the states do, money always drives politics at the higher levels.
It seems to me that the increase in opioid deaths are independent from the use of marijuana. I would say that its likely that fentanyl and the timing of it increasing correlates pretty closely to the increase in deaths. Which could mean the drug market became more dangerous despite the use of medical marijuana, and that could skew perception of the interaction between the two. If you look at death rates alone. Makes me wonder what the relapse rate, and usage rate was in relation to all this, unfortunately it looks like the study is behind a paywall.

Now all they need to do is tax Taco Bell and they'll really start raking in the money. There's a real shitshow of variables involved with the opiod abuse breakout. The rise of depression in the US, the rise of therapists using chemical therapy instead of counseling sessions. Downer music has become more mainstream, and from that genre of music certain artists glorify opioid use. And that's just touching the under 30 crowd mainly. When you get to older people you have doctor's getting told ""hey this does nothing for pain, you have something different?"" And they go straight to the new hotness that is synth opoids.

Personally, I find the most relevant piece of data is that when patients are given the option to use medical cannabis for pain, they favor it over opioids. This really distills the argument down to its purest sense, an A/B comparison of medications for a specific purpose. We cannot control the social or economic factors that may lead* a person down the road of addiction (or any of the other number of countless variables we deal with when studying human behavior) so it's impossible to establish causation on any greater scale.

One problem that I've seen first hand is the cost of medical marijuana for patients. It can cost upwards of $50 for a week's supply of capsules, none of which is covered by insurance. You might get 10% off if you're on Medicaid. I don't know how much income the average opioid addict has, but my guess is that the addiction is far cheaper than the treatment; I don't see how anyone expects to curb deaths from opioid abuse with cannabis when it isn't affordable. Edit: I've been recently informed that a bottle of 30 capsules costs $200, which could be anything from a 10-day supply to a month's supply, depending on the dosage you need.

At the very least, the federal government should reclassify cannabis as something other than schedule 1. I prefer full legalization similar to alcohol, but rescheduling cannabis would allow more scientific studies.
An opioid addiction costs a lot more than $50 a week.
Agreed. Decriminalization would need to happen before we can even get a comprehensive study of benefits and costs. I don't believe that cannabis is as addictive as opioids or even alcohol, but there are too many things that we don't know specifically because of the schedule 1 classification.
It depends. Some opioid treatments are covered by insurance if you have coverage, and there's no lack of unscrupulous doctors willing to write up a prescription for cash under the table.
Mom and Pop Job Creators Pharmacies, in their boundless generosity, have been trying to limit opioid deaths by increasing the price per pill by several thousand percent. God bless those heroes!
We really should have federal ballot initiatives just for issues like this. Congressmen are incentivized to wait to legalize just because the longer it takes means more money spent lobbying from the weed industry & their opponents.
Opioids are narcotics. Cannabis is not a narcotic. There is a scientific definition of narcotic, and cannabis has never qualified to be classified under it, which has been long proven since the 70's, when the addictive affect on the brain was studied to understand the receptors that define what is, and what is not a narcotic. Washington however has not cared about science and has acted like a narcotic is whatever the hell they want to call a narcotic without any comprehension of what a narcotic even is and how science determines if something is one or not. What is a narcotic is -NOT- a matter of political or law enforcement opinion, and never has been.
Chinazo Cunningham seems to be intelligent, informed, and well-spoken person.
At least in NY, you also need to go through the additional barriers of getting a medical marijuana recommendation from a doctor specifically registered to make such recommendations, and then you need to spend another $200 to $300 (also not covered by insurance) to pay for a certification and patient card before you can even walk into a dispensary. On top of that, if you're the kind of patient that would benefit from MMJ to treat mental health issues, you might not have any doctors near you that could write such a recommendation. I currently live in Rochester, NY, and literally all of the registered MMJ doctors in this city specialize in pain management. If you need an MMJ doctor that specializes in mental health, you'll need passage to Syracuse, an hour and a half away. Edit: You also need to pay to renew your certification every year.

Or, y'know, vote Democrat.
That doesn't seem like enough info on it's own. Multiple states have legal ""recreational"" use too, and why would I bother seeing a doctor about a problem I can manage on my own? (I put recreational in quotes because it's perfectly possible for someone to buy it with the intent to use it for a medical condition under those laws too - all the laws really say is that anyone over a certain age can buy it, AFAIK none of them require that you must have fun using it.) I mean, I don't go to the doctor every time I have a headache that I can easily manage with an over the counter painkiller, but a lack of prescriptions doesn't mean the headaches aren't happening and being treated.
Opioids are pretty out of control to be honest. I mean, my vet prescribed Tramadol to my 20 lbs beagle. Is that really the only pain killer? It was from one of those late night ER vet's so maybe that's what they tend to use. (For those curious she didn't react well to it. She kind of had a panicky melt down we assume because she was so doped up. She didn't understand, and she was afraid. This led her to try and run and hide, which led her to hurt her injury more and led to a big cycle of crying, yelping, and running. We basically just held her for a few hours until it got out of her system. Not doing that again.)
Vote as far left as you can. If it takes death squads flaying pharma execs to prompt change, so be it.
Oddly that sentiment doesn't really make me want to want to vote for anyone on the Left. Just the opposite in fact.
Pharmacologically cannibinoids are not narcotics, but legally (not just in Washington state) it is a narcotic. Despite having no ""narcotic"" effects amphetamines and cocaine are also legally classified as narcotic under the Act. (that would be the controlled substances act). Stupid? Yes. But that is what you get when you have lawyers writing the laws....
Deaths is the wrong metric to measure. Death by opioid measures the impact from years ago: when the deceased was originally hooked. If the life expectancy of an opioid addict is 5 years, measuring the overdose rate is really measuring data from 5 years ago, when that group was likely introduced to their addiction. In this sense, trying to tie pot to a reduction in deaths would need to be offset to appropriately line up. Yes, this incorrectly treats opioid addiction like a disease similar to cancer or an auto immune with predictable patterns, but the theory is the important part. Substituting pot for an opioid is trying to prevent the addiction in the first place; it's not going to help curb deaths from people who've been addicted for far longer than pot has been legal. Edit to add: Dr. Cunningham spoke to this by noting that new prescriptions of opioids have decreased in states that legalize. Just wanted to include some credit where it is due.

To do so sounds just as much as a knee jerk reaction as his statement was. Say Bernie wins. There are regulations to keep things in check. Consider we are no longer separating families at the border despite what trumps hard core fans and administration want. Also liberal left individuals do not generally support suppression of speech, or violence to achieve progress. /edit for final thought
There was an article on cbc.ca or somewhere else not too long ago with a clinic in Vancouver actually prescribing medical grade heroin or some injectable to addicts. They get just enough to satisfy the craving but not to get high. It is a daily dose that they come into the clinic for. This has worked for those where other methods of harm reduction has failed and has enabled these addicts to regain control of their lives and an attempt at normalicy.
Youd be voting right anyway. Dont worry. We will get you too. The games going to end soon. The political looting cant last forever.
You echo my thoughts exactly...pot versus opioid deaths aren’t operating in a vacuum. In my case, as I’ve posted here in some detail, my wife was diagnosed with ductal and lobular breast cancer 3.5 years ago and was at Stage 3+...and then had a positive lymph node dissection. So, she was 50/50 at that point; we had to do the planning for the bad 50 while doing chemo and 5 surgeries. And of course, they gave her opioid prescriptions like candy. After nearly putting her in a coma one weekend, I broke a slew of laws and started her on cannabis butter then oil. Pitched the REAL dope in the trash. We live in a medically legal state now, so we can get cannabis a zillion places. We still make our own oil and use that and ‘store bought’ edibles. Currently testing a Pax Era device...like it for acute/emergency situations. Anyway, first...the wife is about to get her 2 year survivor pin next week. She’s in remission but still on major suppression drugs...which cause arthritis type pain and mobility issues. Again, the ‘standard’ course is NSAIDs and/or opioids until your liver and kidneys fail or you OD. Yay. We think that’s insane. And that’s typical of our ‘cancer ladies’ group we work with...those who dumped DOPE - about 80% - are in far better overall health. Admittedly a tiny sample with no controls or hard data, but it makes me think articles like are illustrating the demand and crucial need to LET PEOPLE STUDY THIS AND GET TO THE REAL STORY. We teach classes for cancer patients now on how to use medical cannabis and navigate the minefield. The 4 pillars or table legs or foundation are: Disease / condition you’re treating Strain / terpene profile ‘match’ (works for pain, works for nausea, etc.) Dosage Delivery method My wife is like this: Post cancer treatment side effects / pain Sativas like Super Silver Haze 3-10mg THC = 6-10 hours of relief Oil or edible Took us over a year to dial that in...BECAUSE THE DATA JUST ISN’T THERE YET. I’m am NOT saying the studies are right or wrong. I am saying it underlines the need for a LOT more work.
There are some misconceptions in that statement. The Class 1 designation is not for narcotics, it is for any drug that has been determine to have high abuse potential, no medical use, and severe safety concerns. Then there is a list of other classes with different addiction potentials. Also, while narcotics are addictive, not everything that is addictive is a narcotic.
There were 2 things about this that I thought were important, but couldn't squeeze into the story without wrecking it. So, i'm leaving them here. One is that studies often get dinged with ""correlation != causation"" without looking more deeply. And that's really unfair, because in most cases we have lots of additional relevant data that helps us judge whether the correlation is likely to be informative. In this case, the additional data as cited by the paper and Cunningham don't really give us a clear picture, but they do indicate that doing the work to get some clarity's going to be valuable. The second thing is that this is an example of a failure to replicate being potentially informative. There's been a real tendency to look at these failures and just say ""this researcher was crap"" or ""this field is garbage."" But there can be perfectly valid reasons for results not to replicate, as illustrated here. And, more importantly, finding out why something hasn't replicated can often provide very valuable information.
I believe they are all classified as ""Controlled substances"", of which narcotics is but one classification.
There is far too much hype over cannabis today. It's being touted as the cure for everything. If one study says one thing, and another study says the opposite, maybe cannabis use and opiod use are simply not correlated.
I thought, pharmacologically speaking, narcotics were drugs that can induce sleep? In which case, cannabis definitely qualifies. (I don't disagree otherwise, because there are plenty of narcotics in the legal sense that are known to do the opposite.)
I sometime wonder if how much of a correlation there is between people's reaction to opiates and abuse. Some people are prescribed opiates and describe the effects as dulling, gray, out-of-touch, etc. Other describe the effects as liquid sunshine, happiness in a pill.... I suspect the former group would be less prone to addition. It would be interesting if we could determine why.
I struggle with a variety of health issues, for which I took opioids from about 2012 to 2016. An increase in enforcement enthusiasm made filling a prescription a Kafkaesque nightmare, with both doctor's office and pharmacy terrified of a DEA bust. About that time, it was made known to me that an assortment of cannabis products could be delivered to my door like takeout fast food for a price comparable to the less desirable opioids. I am disillusioned by the ""medical recommendation"" racket that was spawned by the enabling legislation. It is transparently cynical about its single purpose to extract a fee for a certificate.
Little overlap between opioid junkies and marijuana users.
Sleep agents are termed soporifics (things like ambien, halcion), narcotic is the pharmacy term for centrally acting high potency pain relievers like morphine, codeine, heroine, methadone et al (basically mu agonist type agents though that was not identified until much later).
Also notable is that the number of marijuana overdose deaths before and after legalization remains unchanged.
There have been some recent studies that hint that interpersonal differences in reactions to opiate agents are likely due to differences in the structure of the mu receptor itself.

I read the comic book. ""Grognak and the Jungle of the Bat-Babies"". One of my favorites!
We sorta do that. Lots of people take low-dose aspirin daily, for example. Those with arthritis and other ailments take more powerful anti-inflammatories as palliative treatment. I don't know that any significant lifespan improvements have been noted, though.

Quit trying to kiss up to the commentariat!
It should be noted that the 'size/age' thing is really just a broad trend. Consider dogs.. the larger the dog breed, the shorter the lifespan on average. Cats, on the other hand seem to ignore breed sizes entirely and moreover, live longer than dogs regardless of the dogs' breed.

I'm at work, so I can't follow the DOI (and probably shouldn't be on Ars, but there you go), does it say how they maintain chromosome ends without using telomerase?

It would be cool if this could be done in vacuum rather than alcohol.
But... alcohol makes everything better!
I don't think it works. I think the Casimir force is always attractive in vacuum. The way you make it repulsive is to attract the liquid medium more than the gold flake.
""Before you get excited about riding a quantum hoverboard, it's important to emphasize that absolutely none of this scales up. You can't make bigger plates and get a larger repulsive force."" Ah, darn. I was already imagining near frictionless bearings ... well ... maybe for nano-machines?
The DOI link appears to be broken. Here's a link to the actual paper: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/ ... 84/tab-pdf ...not an open-access article though!
Couldn't you still get frictionless bearings? Even if the gap is only 40 micrometers, it's a gap, there's no friction.
The link to the paper seems to be broke.
No, because the gravitational force on those bearings would overcome the Casimir effect. It's only useful for interactions at a nanoparticle scale. So yeah; bearings on a nanomachine, but once you start interacting on a macro scale, the forces here get subsumed by gravity, etc.
Isn't this the same scale at which we manufacture the components of CPUs? No wonder Intel's having so much trouble with their new chips of late. Bizarre quantum effects popping up all over the place.
That's normal, Ars often gets access to the articles before the DOI officially goes live, hence the 'About DOIs' clarifying link right next to it in the article, as this gets brought up by at least one person almost every time.
I'm sure they have ruled it out, but can someone explain to me that is the quantum effects of the vacuum (or in this case alcohol), and not the quantum effects of the atoms on the surfaces?
Who else saw Casimir effects and got excited? Wow, 40 nm repulsion range is much farther than typical range of the Cashimir force in a vacuum. Usually it's under 10nm. I think around 4nm, but that might just be in Silicon?. Article from 2017, but Hong Kong and Princton, not Berkley. https://phys.org/news/2017-04-harness-m ... vices.html
""Quantum Suckage"" is the new name of my disillusioned rock band.

IDK, maybe this wouldn't be an issue if you didn't mention hoverboards in the headline for clicks?
I was entirely too amused trying to figure out what the term Quantum Suckage would actually mean. The minimal quanta that something could possibly suck?
I'm calling shenanigans on the thread title. Came for microscopics, got... even smaller results.
""Wow, what a band! Could they suck any less?"" ""Funny you should mention that... ""
Why does most of my reading about the Casmir effect indicate the plates have to be in a vacuum? As outlined in the article, suspending in ethanol is fine. Likewise, every time I see material about quantum particles popping out of empty space, it is implied this only happens in the vacuum. Is there any particular reason why quantum particles don’t spontaneously form around us and inside us? If they do form inside us, I believe the teaching materials would be at pains to point this out, yet I don’t see why not.
Great Scott!

Actually, the reason I asked is that space, with its vacuum and lack of gravity, could be an ideal place for small self-aligning noncontact bearings.
This looks like it might offer an opportunity for measuring gravitational attraction for VERY small mass. Right now they are working in the 10 gram range and this gold flake is surely an order of magnitude better. This is an important measurement to determine (possibly) if gravity is continuous or granular (quantum).

But the strength of the forces involved is very small. While you might make a non-contact bearing, it wouldn't be able to withstand much of any useful load. What this might to is enable non-contact sensors for various applications because the holding force is so small. Very minor forces could be recorded.
Could the material be shaped or prepared in such a way that it not only dips up and down, but moves in a circle while it does so? And if so, could it move thus forever?

""∆32/∆32 has an approximately 21 percent higher aggregated death rate before age 76 than the other genotypes."" I find this a bit hard to process in terms of the real world. Does the paper translate this into adjusted life expectancy? i.e. how many months / years would we expect this to reduced one's life expectancy? In any event, I think this guy should be prosecuted. Performing a medical intervention that has no benefit to the patient, and is not part of a research programme, with ethical review, is normally regarded as assault. At the very least he should be struck off from practicing as a doctor.
So after the engineered baby is born without HIV use CRISPR to fix the mutation back to normal. Simple! /s
Not to mention he lied to the parents and everyone he worked with. However he's not a physician. He's not even a professional biologist. And that was part of the problem.
Wonder if the affected babies or their families would be able to sue the guy. Anyone knows?
I suspected the Chinese government or some China apologists might take a page from the Putin playbook and hire trolls to burnish its very soiled ethical reputation. Based on a couple of posts already (great that China is taking the lead? Really?), seems that it is happening.
Prosecute? Your post reads like it misunderstands where this took place, which is in CHINA. It may be morally wrong (and I certainly believe so) but prosecution only works in places where the law is broken. It's not clear that this was illegal where it happened.
Statistically, how does this analysis work? Whilst the Biobank may cover ~500,000 people, it's only 14 years old - so I'd imagine the sample size of people who were sampled and then have died to be dramatically less* - let alone once you factor in a double mutation in one gene. On a *much* cruder basis and with no background in stats, I've done some population analysis on items moving through a workflow and - whilst I was processing a notable about of items - I felt the fact that a large chunk of them had not yet completed their lifecycle introduced some significant issues for the confidence I felt in the outcomes. * Edit: I note the sample age was ""40-69 years in 2006-2010"" which does up the probability of mortality compared to a UK population matched sample.

I'm not chinese but have had some interaction with them. Those interactions started as business and later some of us stayed friends. What I've heard about their methods in similar cases is different than western societies'. For crimes/incidents that would upset a sizable population, China takes one of two roads usually. If the actor is a nobody - s/he gets quick and publicised legal proceeding followed by life sentence or death. For other cases where the actor is some political hotshot or family member of a political hotshot - s/he usually disappears and her/his family gets a much more incovenient relocation.
Many see ethics review boards and other similar institutions to be excessively onerous and stand in the way of progress, but it's exactly shit like this why they're needed. I don't think Jiankui's heart was in the wrong place, but you don't get to inject your misguided experiment into the human germ line just because you don't see the consequences.
But why is your life expectancy only 58? What are the elevated risks for high-functioning autism? I'm in the period of irreversible decline, but I do what I can and usually enjoy life. I don't scrabble.
Just think if he had tried it on Huntington's...better understood genetics, a much worse fate

Risks that would be acceptable, especially for a disease that almost certainly terminal if left untreated, are not acceptable when you don't have the disease. We wouldn't let aspirin on the market for headaches if it caused as many birth defects as thalidomide. But thalidomide is still available as a treatment option for people with certain blood cancers provided you're told about its side effects.
Many ethical questions come down to a balance between risk and utility. The work described in the article provides risk, but no utility.
This mutation reminds me of sickle-cell anaemia: one copy of the mutated gene provides protection against malaria; two copies means that you have a really bad time.
I wouldn’t expect there to be significant mortality rate increases caused by autism by itself, but autism often correlates with having other conditions that impact lifespan. These other conditions are much less common in people with high functioning autism. Low functioning autism also affect the ability of the person to communicate about health needs and get appropriate care. The 58 year life expectancy is probably based on a study with few high functioning participants.
""Move fast and break things!"" is not a good model for medical research.
I think one of us is very confused.
Next up: Zombie outbreak
I'm shocked, totally shocked! (*Actually, no I'm not, lock the fuckwit up )
I don't think there is a higher risk of mortalility to those of us who are fairly high functioning. As far as I'm aware there is a higher rate of mortality for the spectrum as a whole but it is related to accidental deaths from things like drowning. I've not seen anything that indicates autism its self affects life expectancy. Last edited by biohazard918 on Wed Jun 05, 2019 7:36 am
Here's an idea - don't intentionally break a protein without knowing everything it's needed for, just because one specific disease has subverted it. This was a ""kill a fly with a sledgehammer"" kind of thing, only it was better to not even kill the fly. ""Move fast, break stuff"" shouldn't be a motto for genetic engineering. I'm worried that idiot ""biohackers"" pulling shit like this will cause some horror (think Thalidomide) that will result in such knee-jerk regulation that actually curing previously intractable diseases will suffer in the long term. Gene editing is the future of our entire species. Don't fuck it up. Edit: Wow, I think every sentence here was already written by someone else. I guess I should have read all the comments! Sorry about that.
It's worth mentioning (as most news articles about this haven't) that a probable unmentioned secondary objective in this gene engineering was to increase intelligence, since there is evidence for improved cognition with disabled CCR5. I mean, kind of coincidental, isn't it, that he decided to target this particular modification that happens to have that particular side-effect.... Exactly the kind of super-sketchy goal that is genetic engineering's worst nightmare. CCR5 is a suppressor for cortical plasticity and hippocampal learning and memory
Forgive me if I'm wrong - statistics and medicine are light years beyond my areas of expertise - but I'm not sure you can make that inference. Suppose a control population has a death rate of 100 deaths per 1000 people before age 76. Then the death rate of the population with 2 copies of the mutation is 121 deaths per 1000 people before age 76. Thus, the likelyhood of a member of the control population reaching 76 years of age is 90%, while that of a member of the other population is 87.9%. That doesn't sound like the members of the latter are ""20 percent less likely to reach the cutoff age of 76 years old"" than members of the former.
Thanks for the substantive reply! Not.
Thank you. That's what I thought. Down's syndrome, that's different. There are children with low intellectual function and a variety of diagnoses who have a short life expectancy. But high functioning autism spectrum? I don't think so.
One would certainly have to look elsewhere for illumination. In your posts, there's none to be found.
That's a very nice write up. It's a shame about the luddites destroying what could be life-saving plants because they're afraid of scientific progress.
It's a shame that people are so against GMO foods without the understanding of what it actually is that they're scared of besides some vague idea that their burrito will stand up on it's own and start rampaging through the town with all the other Frankenfoods. Show them that there isn't a single plant they eat today that hasn't been modified in some form or other through selective breeding or hybridization, and that GMO foods are just an accelerated version of what is already the result of decades or centuries of trial and error, and watch them get right bloody grotty about it. Not that it ever changes their minds, but it *does* show that they don't really understand why they're so against it in the first place.
I don't know why, but this was more lackluster than I had imagined from the title. Not bad, mind you. Still interesting. I was just expecting more. Of something. IDK what.
Tomacco. It tastes like Grandma!
It almost doesn't matter how well these technical problems are solved when luddites keep dragging down GMO crops and demanding all food be ""non-GMO"". I even noticed a non-GMO label on my dog treats this morning.
Ironic as your dog is, itself, a GMO.
Holy Moses, it does taste like grandma!
I want this movie. NOW.
I know you mean nutritionally, but having food becoming drastically more affordable because it is more available is not ""nothing"".
Because they are only engineered to make profits better.
I'm not anti-gmo at all. I think that most people who are really don't know what they're talking about at all. That said I think there are reasonable arguments against them: 1) Yes - we've had selected breeding forever. But the slower pace and rollout always meant the effects of something ""wrong"" with the crop would be relatively limited. 2) There HAVE been unintended consequences before (see the origin of the butterfly logo on GMO free foods). 3) It might not be crazy to worry about the loss of non-gmo crops due to cross pollination. Although whether that matters is a different story. 4) Regarding number 3...due to that possibility and the proprietary nature of the gmo crops, I think you can get into situations where the maker sues you for growing the genome you didn't pay for. I don't think any of those are convincing arguments, but I think reasonable arguments beyond ""No frankenfoods...chemicals are bad"" baloney.
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes [1978] One of the Best B-Movies ever.
I welcome any articles like this that share a nuianced analysis of specific research and it's progression. That is something missing from our public discussion on GMOs and has led to the fear we see today. I'm for using this technology to increase nutrition and yields. This technology coupled with other practices in sustainable farming is our best shot to address the issues of: malnutrition, global warming, and water table depletion. The key hurdle in my mind to overcoming those challenges is the beliefs and additudes of our society. Both in society as a whole & in the corporations and research facilities working on the technology.
I shouldn't call names, but it angers me that people can't see past their quinoa or over their bottle of kombucha, my mom included. Monsanto? Terrible. But GMOs themselves have the potential to help so many with proper research that doesn't, you know, get destroyed. Even in America, many people can't afford to buy themselves anything but the cheapest food and can be ridiculed for doing so. Most can, such as myself, and since right now GMOs don't really provide extra nutrition I'll often chose non-GMO, if it's not tons extra. But god, let poor people eat! Not everyone can have the privilege to pick and chose their foods like you do, you wet doorknob. Maybe mass-produced is EXACTLY what the poverty-stricken need, especially in developing nations.
Slate wrote about the uphill battle GMO crops like the Golden Rice faces: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_an ... rrors.html
Sausage Party: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1700841/
I was watching a short (<5 minutes) Vox video this morning that outlines one of the major downsides of modern farming practices: the loss of genetic diversity in our agriculture. Many species of plant have been permanently lost over the years. As much as GMO should be a part of our future, there is much value in preserving the plants of our past. It's worth a quick watch for anyone even mildly interested: https://youtu.be/LwBUfB7hU6A
Opponents to GMO foods never have legitimate scientific reasons to be against them. Corporations developing these organisms and then restricting open usage in the name of IP and profits are not helping. The only way humanity is going to feed the billions of people on this planet in a sustainable, efficient, and economical way is to embrace GMOs and their usage. These same GMO processes, advanced and refined will allow us to take agriculture to the Moon, planets, and other stars. It is very frustrating when ignorance dominates the conversation with catchy one-liners like ""frankenfoods"" to scare the moms into falsely believing all GMOs are terrible to feed the kids.
Its crazy to me how people will actively fight a crop that uses a GMO which helps it grow more, healthier food with less chemicals, and couldnt care less how much monsanto style pesticides are used in non-GMO crops
3 & 4 are huge problems with the corporate culture around GMOs. By IP law those genes can be patented. There is a high degree of cross pollination between farms. Some (but not all) of the major GMO seed producers have gone after farmers for infringement. There used to be an entire industry in the US dedicated to helping farmers gather seeds for use on their farm the following year or to resell. That has largely died off as a result of patent enforcement. Unfortunately this hurts the biodiversity of plants and crowds smaller players out of the market. - Source - I used to work for one of the major companies that specifically did not enforce those patents on farmers.
We’ve already had this issue with bananas, which are all cloned — and the entire population has already died out and had to be replaced with a different banana which tastes worse. Aside from IP issues, this is one of the major issues with GMOs.
Commenters here are focusing way too much on a handful of protestors and way too little on corporations and capitalism which have done radically more to hold back beneficial GMO crops than the protesters.
My personal feeling is that people are looking at what is happening to the supply chain, namely ever increasing storage times and centralization of transportation, and they see a decrease in food quality. People don't take the time to understand why and GMO as something favored primarily by big agra in the US gets caught up in what is largely a logistics issue driven by our supermarkets and other middlemen. The disconnect between consumer and farmer is what people are acutely aware of, GMO is a handy scapegoat.
The reason that the public is so against GMOs is that one of the major commercial uses of GMOs was to make crops “RoundUp Ready” - that is to make them impervious to the insecticide RoundUp so that you can use the chemical on your fields and kill off the pests without worry about it killing your crops. That forever connected the concept of GMO with the concept of poison in the public consciousness. In an alternate universe where GMO technology was never used for RoundUp I don’t think we’d see anywhere near as much resistance to it. It’s a shame really because GMO is useful for so much more than just making it easier to use pesticide... ugghhh... Last edited by wrylachlan on Tue Jun 04, 2019 11:50 am
There is also the cost and regulation to consider. To get a new trait approved in the US it costs between $100-150 million to get through the process, and making a plant transgenic automatically excludes it from export to Europe and huge hurdles to export to many other countries. And that’s on top of the R&D costs to find the thing and get it transferred to begin with. So if you want a transgenic crop, it needs to be a huge market and a guaranteed home run trait - that pretty much limits you to corn and soy and the like. And unless the growers see a big profit increase to planting the transgenic version of the crop, they are unlikely to pay extra for it. There is some indication that Crispr crops may not face the same regulatory costs, but Europe recently said they count as GMO, so there are still export problems. You also can’t insert new genes that way, so your “palette” of changes is limited.
No amount of abundance can overcome greed. As long as billionaires own the sole rights to genes and seeds and choose to maximize profit from them, people are gonna suffer and starve.
Point 4 is where the problem ly's in my opinion. I remember watching a documentary about farmers getting sued for growing Monsanto's crops even though they never planted any of them. Monsanto's agents would find a farmer that was unfortunate to have a neighboring farmer that used Monsanto's crops. The wind picked some of the seed up and spread them to near by farms. Those farms would than get sued for infringement of Monsanto's patents. Farmers would usually keep some crop seeds for next years seeding. If they were Monsanto's seeds, these farmers would get sued because Monsanto doesn't allow for this kind of farming. The farmer must buy seeds every year from Monsanto if they want the disease resistance seeds. Monsato's behavior is a problem for all people that need to eat. I am all for gmo crops, I just have a problem with the methods used by these companies.
I don't see how the banana example demonstrates anything particular to GMO crops. The bananas weren't GMO. They were a result of plain old selective breeding and asexual reproduction techniques. Genetic diversity and the potential for mass die-offs due to disease is an issue endemic to farming in general, not just GMO crops.
Not to mention how valid concerns about companies like Monsanto have been a large part of spreading irrational anti-GMO sentiments. But of course no politician or company is going to go and say ""GMOs are fine it's capitalism that's the problem"", so harmful ideas will be allowed to fester
I don't understand why they didn't submit their golden rice to more Southeast Asian countries for approval. I would assume that getting golden rice approved in that area of the world where the dominant staple food is rice would be important.
It's not an example of GMO, it's an example of why a lack of diversity can be bad. (And thus, if GMOs lead to less diversity, it is also a problem with GMOs.)
I realize that the point of the article is additional or specific nutritional load in certain foods. Possibly there will be a significant future benefit to engineering that content. But it still seems that by far the most valuable contributions of modified food production is volume and volume in hostile environments. Crop yields and resistance to the environmental threats of drought, insect, and weed damage is feeding millions.

Titter ye not ! Back in the mid-90s one could buy GM tomato puree in the UK. As I understand it, this had a gene deleted that in normal tomatoes caused spoilage, so no addition of 'foreign' DNA. It was cheaper and more importantly much more tomato-ier (is that a word) than the ordinary tomato puree. Then the anti-GM lobby got to work and it was removed from sale. Really pissed me off.
Maybe the reason GMO crops benefit farmers more than consumers is because farmers are the seed producers customer, not food consumers.
People who destroy experimental crops are not 'activists' or 'protesters'. They are vandals. But, more to your point, the concept of GMO gets a bad rap from the behavior of corporations in the name of GMO. We've been genetically modifying plants and animals since the dawn of time. However, like the vaccine 'controversy', uninformed people are easily mislead by those with an agenda.
we may not gain full appreciation of the GMO efforts until those same efforts are applied to the consumers. evolution takes pains to exclude 'failed' modifiucations by way of slow extinction and failed replications. humans continue to hold strong to the concept that they must alter everything else in the quest for our own 'glorification' and ascent to some supreme, ideals. so we tweak the food supply, enrich the energy available for caloric intake, even improve the crop resistence to (what may be deemed disease/loss/failure) the perceived needs of our own specific requirements, the eventual long term impact may be so far in the future (cataclysms come in many forms) we may be unable to 'tweak' the environment back to a stable and quiescent balance. we aint the last word and surely were not the reason for life here on gaia anyway. for better or worse seems to apply to plenty of choices as we stumble ahead in time....

How much information did the bot have regarding the position of it's teammates and humans? Was it limited to character field of view?
Someone at the Pentagon is scratching their ear right now
No military application here. Nope. SkyNet edges closer. The best part happens when rogue powers learn that they can just steal the software, as they currently do with NSA cracking tools.
Having AI master chess is all fine, and defeat humans at Go was interesting. Having AI master Quake III Arena is intriguing. But I sure hope they stop before someone creates WOPR as the successor to FTW to see how it does at playing Global Thermonuclear War.
There is no stopping them. Eventually they will conclude that they can ""win"" 99% of time in simulation and then we are in for a rough ride.
Big deal. Bots have been kicking my ass at Quake for 20 years!
Still want to see them try this on TF2. Restrict the AI's information to the screen visuals and game audio. I just want to see an AI actively try dumb ideas that work. Like 5 going fish scout and rocket jumping. Odds of the AI suddenly spawning a conga line?
It would be fun to see them playing csgo too.
Dashelgr wrote: How much information did the bot have regarding the position of it's teammates and humans? Was it limited to character field of view? The paper appears to state that it was given similar information to a human playing the game. A couple of relevant quotes from the paper: The Paper wrote: In contrast to previous work (13–23), agents do not have access to models of the environment, state of other players, or human policy priors, nor can they communicate with each other outside of the game environment. Each agent acts and learns independently, resulting in decentralized control within a team. The Paper wrote: It receives raw red-green-blue (RGB) pixel input x_t from the agent’s first-person perspective at time step t, produces control actions a_t ~ p(·|x1, ..., xt) by sampling from the distribution given by policy p, and receives r_t, game points, which are visible on the in-game scoreboard.
How much of Quake III CTF relies on strategy and how much on aim? I am quite sure a good strategy and knowledge of the map is key but perfect aim I think has more power.
One less game I need to play now.
Did the AI use an Aim Bot? Or it would be funny if it figured out some keypress that unintentionally give you an advantage that the developer of a game never intended it to be part of actual gameplay.
In CS:source, all you had to do was turn up bot strength to max, start a match. Walk around a corner and get shot in the head half a dozen times before you even recognized bad bot.
And how accurate were they? Did they adjust their accuracy to that of your average or ""expert"" humans? Would have a hard time beating any bot that had 100% accuracy and wasn't a complete dimwit as a computer can aim infinitely better than a human can via mouse.

From the article: Quote: That's not to say that FTW excelled in every aspect of the game. For example, humans visual abilities made them better snipers. But at close range, FTW excelled in combat, in part because its reaction time was half that of a human's, and in part because its accuracy was 80 percent, compared to humans 50 percent. They did an experiment where they hindered the bot's reaction times and the bot still won, but I don't know if they also tried hindering accuracy.
BOOOOOOO! AI is about teaching computers to reason like (or, ideally, better than) a human. But reaction time is a very important aspect of FPS games. When an AI is given a mechanical advantage like this, it becomes very difficult to separate it from the effects of the machine's ability to reason.
""Bots"" have been beating players in FPS games since the dawn of FPS games... Sometimes simply by spinning around and looking for them. It's pretty well known that mechanical skill heavily outweighs strategy in these games.
Yeah, but can it learn to taunt like in Unreal Tournament?
Danny Hillis has written about Genetic Algorithms a bit, and I found his analogies pretty compelling. It's great to see those approaches being put to practical use! Particularly he writes about the ""local maximum"" problem - where a GA rapidly evolves to find a successful strategy, that is more successful than any small mutation can overcome. So he introduced ""viruses"" into the GA environment, which would cause ""sickness"" that pushed the genetics of the local algorithm out of its local maximum. The viruses would then evolve and the GA would evolve against each other, and this competition would allow the GAs to find more successful ""regional maxima"" that had better fitness (success). I think he describes this work in Pattern On the Stone, which is a great book in any case. IIRC, he says something along the lines: ""If I had to trust my life to a sorting algorithm, I would definitely prefer the algorithm I evolved using these methods, over any algorithm coded by hand. With this algorithm, even if you disabled parts of it, or flipped bits randomly, it would still produce a decent sort, if not the best one. Try that with any hand coded solution, and you just get a crash."" Last edited by unequivocal on Thu May 30, 2019 3:51 pm
Given enough permutations, these bots will eventually learn to crouch-rape as a form of taunting fallen foes, as it leads to psychological torment that (slightly, but measurably) affects how they perform the next round... (Infinite monkeys with typewriters, and all that)
At the level they are talking about, these players are likely really good at both.
How It Should Have Ended: Wargames ""Joshua, play tic tac toe against yourself."" *Joshua plays many games, figures out it always ends in a tie* ""Okay, now try Global Thermonuclear War."" *Joshua plays many games, figures out it always ends in a tie* ""Do you see the lesson, Joshua?"" ""Yes, Dr. Falken."" *System moves to Defcon 1. Imminent launch sirens sound* ""Joshua, what are you doing?!"" ""Launching an attack before the enemy is able to develop their own WOPR, while I can still win."" *Armageddon ensues*
If your route os known and ""blue"" successfully intercepts forwards (towards your cap) and reverse (towards their cap) you get stick in a crossfire and that almost never ends well. Sure a well aimed shot can turn a 2v into a duel but thats assuming it was a perfect senario where you gobbed the first person and have time to react to the second. About the longest a duel can last is 5 seconds unless a proper disengagement happens (the flag carrier breaking on their terms) or the flag gets dropped. TL:DR Even a better player is gonna get bagged if they get properly mobbed.
Interesting, we're now moving beyond layers in deep nets by stacking the nets themselves each with their own intention. That intuitively feels what needs to happen. My fingers close on the spatula, my arm moves it to stir the food as I path find through the recipe to make a meal to get the girl to raise kids together ... Whilst another part listens to music, another thinks about work, another chunk lets me stand in front of the hob. Damn we're complicated. Now, if we can just reduce the training time.
AI does not have to perform any hand-eye co-ordination. Let's see an AI with robotic arms outperform a person. Not saying AI isn't good but it's apples and oranges until the machine is autonomous and moving about, at which point you now have a budding Terminator, congratulations.
It's not understanding the game or generalized learning, but like search and translation it has some impressive practical outcomes. Until you put it into the ED-209: https://youtu.be/Hzlt7IbTp6M
Interesting. It took awhile for the ai to learn killing was beneficial. A human player learns first by trying things, where any affect is positive stimulation, even if not immediately positively affecting their goal. The ai only learns behaviors that directly influence it's goal.
Hmm teaching AI to shoot/kill humanoids. Nope nothing wrong with that. Do they want Skynet? Because this seems like a good way to get Skynet.
I'm wondering if maybe somebody can put the computing power required for this in better perspective. How long would it take for someone with consumer-grade hardware to accomplish something like this? How much would it cost to do it in the cloud? Could a small business, or god forbid, a terrorist organization afford to do this? Or is it strictly in the realm of governments and supercomputers?
More to the point, humans don't enter into a game in a complete void of knowledge. Even if they've never heard of Quake, even if they've never seen an FPS or any other game with guns, any person would bring enough outside context into the game with them to immediately get that the thing sticking out from the bottom of the screen is some kind of weapon and that therefore the game is about shooting people. Even if the kinda weird looking weapons of Q3A threw them off for a moment, they'd figure it out when they got shot by another player. That's sort of the beauty of these AIs -- you don't need to reproduce all that context for it to figure out the game. But at the same time it means something inherently obvious to a human -- ""this game is about shooting, shooting is good"" -- needs to be figured out. And maybe it decides differently than humans, who will tend to engage with the game on the terms it presents given all that context. It's neat.
Certainly an interesting question(s) But to all the 'skynetters', the hardware* required to make any of this AI effectual in meatspace is likely a magnitude more complicated and expensive than all software resources combined. *hardware meaning actual, physical components to be manipulated by the AI
But that means they do communicate, using in-game chat? Does that mean they had to develop their own signalling?
Good question, and if so: Human audio chat is slow to speak and then hear and understand. Was this communication at those speeds or was it some ultra-fast exchange of data?
My interpretation of this, especially since they had human and AI players on the same team for a number of matches, was that the AI was inferring what the other player might be doing based on their actions. So if one player is heading in the direction of the flag, the AI infers that it is going to fetch the enemy flag and positions itself accordingly.
I really want to see this kind of technology used to build a bot for Super Smash Bros. Melee. Seeing an AI's idea of ""perfect play"" here would be incredibly interesting, and it could even affect the modern competitive meta. In particular, it has the potential to absolutely dominate doubles matches, which I feel have a lot more untapped depth and strategy than singles matches right now. While competitive players will generally refuse to play tournament matches on anything except a real console, you could probably train it with a modified Dolphin emulator, and then use it on a real console by plugging it into the audiovisual feed and a controller port. The game has so many advanced techniques you can take advantage of, more than humans usually are capable of, so an AI could create some fascinating strategies, even if they aren't the best ones. If it were also (manually) taught the restrictions of modern tournament rulesets, it would be fascinating to see what it believes to be ideal picks or counterpicks for stages and characters in difference situations. Someone has already attempted to make a ""perfect"" Melee bot called SmashBot, but it was restricted to Fox vs. Marth on Final Destination. It was also programmed manually and had full access to the game's RAM, and as such wasn't terribly interesting, because it just looked like every other TAS that humans have already made, just in real time. I wonder if it could be trained with some of the additional knowledge from the debug modes like the collision data displays somehow. Competitive players certainly train using tools like this, but similarly aren't allowed to have access to this data during an actual tournament match.
I'm also interested in the potential use of these AIs as helping (or maybe replacing) balance teams. If you can just let a simulation train itself on your game for a week and have it figure out all the OP strategies, you can potentially make games with lots of complicated interactions much more balanced.
How good is it at Dance Dance Revolution?
I'm really looking forward to reading the paper, having spent quite a bit of time with both Quake and RL research. It seems really tricky to separate mechanical from strategic skill though, as mechanical skill is such a large threshold to cross in real-time games. 80% aim accuracy is well into super-human territory in Quake, even though it varies from weapon to weapon. Aim was also a very noticeable confounding variable in earlier work on e.g. learning to play Doom. That basically ended up being an aimbot with some navigation capability, instead of playing like a human. I actually think duel would be a more interesting game mode than CTF. You avoid the suspicion that the agents are just better at coordination because they were trained jointly and don't actually have to talk to each other. Duel is also the primary e-sport version of Quake, and requires quite a bit of strategy and reasoning under uncertainty. Last edited by Sill on Thu May 30, 2019 5:29 pm
I think this is cool and all, but my pet peeve still stands. This is not Artificial Intelligence, it is another expert system that has been taught to play Quake. Now, let's look how it did that. It had to play over 200,000 iterations/variations to handle one aspect of a complex game. An amazing feat and I love the proof in concept approach, but let us call this what it is...expert learning. Let's take our awesome Quake Champion and plop it into World of War Craft, Everquest, or thavoc's favorite: My Little Pony, Everfree Forest without any further input. Now that would be intelligence since it could adapt without external programming. I am a little worried about a skynet potential, but on this path, it could be defeated, just by changing the rules outside what had been seeded at the start. Having it adapt outside what its initial programming allows....now that is scary. When they introduce an intelligence that if asked, figures out how to play any game like millions of innocent neophytes experience, if it can learn ethics, morality, not just the goal to win...then I'll consider it AI. Joshua expanded to that level on his own in the end....the only way to win is not to play was an moral statement, not a goal oriented statement.

Does this process reduce the *number* of transistors, or merely their size? Or is the potential reduction in number related to the ability to convert the gates from one type to the other?
""But there's a mismatch between these logical operations and what we can do with silicon: a silicon transistor can only take input from a single source instead of the two required here. As a result, these operations require two transistors on a processor. Transistors made of an atomically thin material can have fundamentally different structures, though. To test some of these, the researchers used molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which forms graphene-like sheets slightly thicker than its component atoms. Like silicon, MoS2 is a semiconductor; unlike silicon, putting input gates both above and below a single layer of the material is relatively easy to do. This allows for the layer to take input from two different sources, making it a direct match for the logical operation's input.""
this is interesting. wonder if this can be applied to 3d nano stacking and other exotics martial
If graphene sheets are 200x as strong as steel, then presumably running into a single layer of graphine would be similar to 200x the thickness of steel? So, one sheet of graphene is 0.0000003 mm thick; the equivalent strength steel would then be 0.00006 mm -- presumably similarly invisible to someone coming at it head on and I'm guessing would be torn through by anything as massive as a person, let alone machinery.
I recall us translating most logical functions we implemented in hardware to use as many NAND gates as possible because of spatial efficiency, but maybe that's not an issue here? Also, a very important part of modern circuitry is CMOS, is that (or something similar) doable with this technology? I have a hard time seeing any technology that has a constant current flowing succeeding.
Technically correct, but that's using bipolar technology. You would probably want to avoid that in chips, because it would use far too much current (and produce too much heat). Implied in the article is that we are talking about MOSFET technology. It's actually somewhat explicit by the use of ""gate"" rather than ""base"".
I didn't see it mention NOT, NAND, or NOR operations. You have to have one of those to be able to perform all logical circuits. Is that a current limitation of this material? Seems like it won't be replacing computers ever if that is a hard limitation.
Apparently, yes. This seems to be a form of FET technology, as evidenced by the use of terms such as ""channel"" and ""gate"". MOSFET is a specific type of FET (one that has an insulating layer between the gate and the channel), and CMOS is a way to arrange multiple MOSFET transistors so that always only one or the other is conducting. Theoretically, CMOS would never allow any current to flow. BTW, FET stands for field effect transistor. MOS stands for Metal Oxide Silicone (although it is used for any kind of insulating layer, not just what the name would suggest) and CMOS stands for complementary MOS.
Thanks. I read the story twice and missed that paragraph both times.
It's not a hard limitation. In fact, the underlying paper mentions NAND etc. You can build an inverter by placing the output transistor between ground and the output, instead of between Vcc and output.
Logic gate efficiency in the dimensions of size/packing/current draw (which is directly proportional to heat dissipation)/speed of propagation all depend on the underlying processes and gate materials. NAND gates tend to be faster in speed of propagation, but less efficient in packing and that is generally the reasoning behind using NAND logic to build up logical computational units that are capable of reaching a target clock cycle rate. They also have a fundamental property of easing issues with p-channel and n-channel circuitry i.e. ""pull-up network"" vs ""pull-down network"".
Technically wrong because diode logic is lossy (diodes require a forward voltage to work) and requires load resistors and inverters, since the minimum unit required to create a full spectrum of logic operations is a NOR gate, not an OR or AND gate. Field effect devices ended up being faster than bipolar ones, but those of us who remember TTL logic will also know that practical devices could be made with one or fewer transistors per gate. A 4 input NAND needs 4 transistors, for instance. That's because the input to a TTL gate is an emitter and it is easy in planar technology to fabricate a multi-emitter transistor. Another low part count technology was i2l, which made use of multicollector transistors where the output of several gates could be combined into a logic function and a single gate could supply several distinct successive logic functions. It was seen in the rad-hard SBP9989 processor, among others, and the power consumption was comparable to CMOS. The article is not clear because it uses ""gate"" interchangeably for the equivalent to a gate electrode, and its earlier and common usage in ""logic gate"". So I think the original poster, though incorrect (pure diode logic is impossible) in one respect, was not wrong to exclude bipolar technology. It isn't pointed out in the article, but the OR gate is really just equivalent to two MOS transistors in parallel (the gates just affect the layers closest to them) and the AND gate carries the implication that the signal applied to one gate must affect the other gate, due to cross-capacitance. So this isn't quite as simple as stated.
""but wait, there's more!"" If I call within the next 10 minutes, will you double my order for free?
Thanks for clearing that up, it's been a while since I took hardware classes
But compared to CMOS you cannot build a useful one. The difference between TTL and CMOS from a circuit design point of view is that TTL (and IIL) have an input that basically switches from zero current to a sink current, but CMOS presents a capacitive input which suffers from Miller effect (the switching of the output opposes the input signal by transfer capacitance). Therefore, the single ended output stage typical of TTL that you are describing (sink current or a small source current) does not work well with CMOS, which requires a positive current drive to initiate a change from high to low or vice versa. In TTL, which is current heavy anyway, traces can be driven using pull up resistors to give fairly consistent impedance. In CMOS, the use of pull up or pull down resistors obviates the entire use of CMOS - that static power consumption is very small. In the dates of the switchover from LSTTL to HCMOS, where some circuits had to be mixed, driving PCB traces of any length could be a major problem, and some exciting bugs were tracked down to things like an inadequately specified connection ringing and producing, say, a 20ns pulse big enough to induce a switching current on an adjacent track. tl;dr this semiconductor design may or may not be useful but, as it stands, there doesn't seem to be any way for it to produce a complete circuit on its own.
nice idea, but pity the physical strength is not up to good cling film...
Ahem. ""silicon"" -- ""silicone"" is the stuff one uses in clear adhesive sealants (like bathroom sealant).
The simplest logic concepts to understand may be AND, OR and NOT, but the most atomic gates are the NAND and NOR; they are functionnaly complete and can be assembled to constitute any logic operation. Notwithstanding their particular capabilities, I'm curious to know how these new devices compare to AND-OR-INVERT gates when it comes to transistor count.
Also, the S in MOSFET stands for ""semiconductor.""
Your guess is correct. Graphene's reported strength is naturally per weight. It is obviously not ""absolute"" - that wouldn't make any sense. If a we passed through a single atomic layer of graphene we wouldn't even realize it. However if we used it as a coating for a compatible very thin substrate things would start to look different. If we wanted to get serious we would coat a layer of graphene on a super thin compatible foil, then we would alternate between very thin insulating coatings and graphene coatings. We need insulating layers to prevent graphene from turning into graphite and to provide structural support to the graphene layers. A few hundred graphene layers (along with the intermediate insulating layers) would probably be enough for our devious Lovecraftian scheme. The thing wouldn't be invisible though, so we would need to use clever deception to lure our victim to pass through it. Some kind of distraction should suffice. For best results our lethal thingy should be placed at neck height. Last edited by Korios on Tue May 28, 2019 4:16 pm

Thanks for clearing that up, it's been a while since I took hardware classes I believe it's also an ease of manufacture thing. NANDs are universal gates (you can make anything out of them) and you can lay them all down at once. Given how expensive a set of masks are that's a pretty big manufacturing savings, not to mention the quality improvement.
Not trying to be annoying, I think it matters if this is an OR or XOR gate. An OR gate produces a value of 1 if either input, or both inputs are 1. The article doesn't clearly state that this is an OR or XOR: Here: Quote: Computer instructions can be distilled down to a series of simple logical operations. Of these, the simplest are AND and OR. AND produces a value of 1 only if both of its two inputs are also 1; OR does so if either of the two inputs are 1. And here: Quote: The authors compared it to having two ""channels"" on the same device. If either of those channels was set to ""on,"" then some current would flow through the device, making its global state ""on."" This was a perfect match to the logical OR function. And also here: Quote: As a result, you only need one of the two input gates to be in the ""on"" state for the transistor to conduct. From those 3 areas it didn't clearly state what happens if both inputs are ""on"". If the result is 0 it's XOR, if it's 1 it's OR.
Given the description of the mechanism, it seems pretty clear that it's an OR gate.
I thought it was Metal Oxide Semiconductor.
It slices, it dices, it Julienne fries.....
A variety of materials. The S in MOSFET stands for semiconductor. Not all are made from silicon. Though the vast majority are. Certainly silicon CMOS is the technology to beat for basically all computing applications.

The article is a little odd in its omission of the NOT gate, as someone else mentioned, which is required for a complete logic. Also the comment about requiring multiple transistors was odd in a similar way: making a multi-input NAND gate (self-complete) in some logics is simply a matter of one transistor with as many gates as inputs. Additionally, while using light to flip a gate from AND to OR doesn't seem likely to be very useful generally. While it could make some few components that would be very difficult to manufacture in silicon (or ...), there are very few things that would be useful for overall, as any source of light for modulation would require its own control(s).
As I've always understood it a transistor is a gate over an active region, not a continuous section of active region regardless of how many gates. LVS always agreed with me, so... That's a bit of a nit, but then again in a way it's not because the area still scales linearly with the number of inputs but in this tech it doesn't. And in CMOS you can only use that trick for one rail side of the gate and the other requires parallel transistors. Not that layers scaling with number of inputs really seems inherently better. Kinda depends on how the manufacturing pans out I'd think. Last edited by wyrmhole on Tue May 28, 2019 6:49 pm
Not a comprehensive list, but gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, silicon germanium, silicon, and, according to the article,molybdenum disulfide.MOS is not specific to silicon devices.
Moore's Law not as dead as we thought? Fascinating...
Thanks for your corrections - much appreciated. The way I read it, the AND comes about because there is a single channel, and either of the two gates can, by itself, pinch off the current.
In the end, it's really not relevant. MOS has become a generic term for any kind of insulator used between a gate and the channel. The first ones were oxides, and the name stuck. Today, it's barely even recognizable as an acronym (which I got wrong, to boot).
I have a simple opinion. I can take only so many clothes off before I start breaking public decency laws. Ideally the thermostat should be set to the closest possible happy medium between the sexes. Other things should be taken into account to make the environment more comfortable. Such as changing the rigid dress code to allow people to dress more appropriately to feel comfortable in the office. If women work better when its warm, and men do not. Perhaps allowing men to wear shorts a a t-shirt are actually good because they can stay cooler in a hotter environment that way. Personal vents under a desk that can pipe in direct hot air or direct cold air to make workers more comfortable in their immediate surrounding.
Or women can wear warmer clothing instead - no one is stopping them.
Maybe I'm missing this, but don't the results show that, essentially, at the kind of reasonable temperature differences most offices operating range enclose there is statistically little difference? What's the big difference between 72°F and 75°F? There isn't one and we should all just be thankful we're not roofers busting our ass on a hot roof in the middle of an Arizona summer.
Unexpectedly? Really? That's almost on the level of ""unexpectedly, we got wet, standing in the rain"". Almost.
I'd be interested in seeing a similar study, where it's controlled for amount of clothing worn, as well as body mass to skin surface area ratio (helps with cooling). By any chance is there an easy way to measure total skin surface area? Also curious whether men and women have slightly different body mass to skin surface area ratios?
My wife and I are actually opposite when it comes to temperature preference. (I have no idea which of us works better at a given temperature). Her preferred temperature is about 3C below mine.
Men and Women are hormonally very different, and there's also the clothes factor, where as for the make-up, cultural expectations mandate different clothing and even ""appeal"". There are a lot of factor here, that might be studied on the long-run. For myself, I learned that we have all different needs in room temperature, and we have all to take accounts the others and not only our own needs.
More relevant in this context is probably the skeletal muscle mass and distribution. https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10. ... 00.89.1.81
As a dude who often wears sweaters in overly air conditioned offices, I can tell you that isn't sufficient. [edit] and office dress codes are still a thing. My last employer only dropped their dress code last year. One that was specific enough to ban peep toe shoes. Last edited by thegrommit on Sun May 26, 2019 8:54 am
Would be curious to know if the study looked at a specific factor: how were the men and women dressed? Having worked in an office environment for years, I would generalize that men liked the temperature a bit warmer than women. That never surprised me. Many (most?) men wore a long sleeve shirt and possibly a T-shirt. Many women wore sleeveless tops, often a thinner fabric than a man's shirt, and <ahem> undergarments that didn't have the same insulation as a man's T-shirt. Fashion and custom differ for men and women in ways that I suspect affect what temperature they find comfortable. I would kid my female colleagues with space heaters to put on some more clothes. I kept a light blanket in my office for visitors (my office was particularly cold because the ancient system couldn't be adjusted, but it was fine for me). Or, men could make the adjustment. When I was in academia before retiring, the dress code was much more relaxed, and male colleagues would often wear polo shirts, shorts, and sandals. Further to this point, I've seen more offices go more casual, with the shirt-and-tie giving way to polos. P.S.: Surprised a bit by the down votes. I asked a question regarding something that might influence the outcome and gave a rationale for my question. Last edited by rpearcemoses on Sun May 26, 2019 10:47 am
As a consultant, I've worked in a lot of different office buildings. In some cases, most employees wore suits, in others sweaters. It makes no difference when your hands are too cold to type comfortably.
So we have a super weak correlation coming out of super noisy regression data (look at the graphs), they got to choose whether to look at error rate, total number correct, or total number incorrect and we know that the researchers collected other variables including: Age Major (in Econ/Biz) Native in German Also the result they report *only* controls for gender (they claim it is robust against inclusion of other controls but it's not clear if this means it is still significant or even what this means). Also the result is only significant on *some* sub-tests not the whole data set (and indeed different subgroups get different directions of effect). They also made the choice to include experimental session (i.e. use a multilevel model with per session effects) in at least one model (not sure if that's in the model they report results for). So the paper is basically a giant billboard yelling forking paths (i.e. many researcher degrees of freedom relative to power of test) and giving us little to no reason to trust the conclusion.

The hormones part is going to complicate the hell out of the follow-up to this study. For men, the test group here are almost at peak testosterone levels and hence their highest metabolic rate of their lives. No surprise (to me) they perform better when it's colder. For women, the changes through menopause are broad-ranging but many post-menopausal women prefer a warmer environment. I suspect that a repeat of this study with 50- and 60-somethings will show less of a performance difference with temperature change for either sex.
You know that undergarments part how?? 🤔 I always find offices way too hot, even though I'm a guy and I wear only T-shirts. But I generally wear T-shirts all the time even in winter. I just hate having anything on my sleeves when I'm typing. Even when I go to a 'formal' meeting the most I'd wear is a sleeveless shirt, I'd never ever wear a suit. And really this is what I hear from most men in our office.. they always find it too hot and the women too cold.
I hope researchers look at age related performance as well. This study shows that college age men and women have temperature related performance differences. As we age, I'd guess we'll see differences from this study (possibly a more stark disparity between the sexes but who knows). I'd also be curious if this is about gender norms or biological differences.
The charts show solid lines labeled Predicted, are those just best fit lines? Maybe a translation issue. I'm more concerned with how there are way more than 5 percent of the data points falling outside the 95% confidence limit lines. Not sure how to explain that.
I came to post just that. What is their 95% limit confidence of?
When I see this sort of thing I think- ""Well, they had to find something...""
Fair amount of scepticism here, but I think this is quite nice for an initial study. It proves precisely nothing, but the sample size is adequate for a first attempt, and I like the way the tests distinguished between speed and accuracy. It ought to be enough to whet the appetite and justify further study, to see whether this holds up. Further study needs to look at other variables, not just clothing, but also different age bands - college students represent a very particular (ahem) hormonal point in life ...

What's the difference between 72 and 75? That's 22 vs 24 degrees C, so a difference of two degrees C. The data in the article says that increasing the temperature from 72 to 75 will result in women's math scores increasing by 3.6%, women's verbal scores increasing by 2%, and men's verbal scores dropping by 1%. It's not a huge difference, but a net difference between men and women over 3% could matter if, for example, there is competition for promotions, raises, etc. That presumes these results generalize to other types of performance, which is unclear. This is a very interesting study, but there are a lot of unknowns and it's obvious other people will need to replicate and expand on it. But no one could do that if it wasn't published; that's the point of getting the study out there, so people can follow it up from multiple angles.
It would be the 95% confidence limit for the predicted relationship between temperature and performance. It's not necessarily the interval in which 95% of the data falls. You could have 100% of the data falling within a narrow range and still have a very wide 95% CI on the slope of the graph if the relationship is inconsistent. There is high variability in the individual data points (which actually represent groups, not individuals), but the prediction is that on average a group's performance would have been shifted in a certain way if they were tested at a different temperature. There's no in-group repeat testing though (because it would create its own biases).
Man here. In the winter, I'm almost always comfortable in the office; in the summer the AC is typically cranked too low. It seems impossible to educate Those Who Control the Thermostat that it should be warmer in the office in the summer. There are cost savings to be had on the AC bill by letting the temperature rise a few degrees, and your office workers will be more comfortable and (I guess mostly if they're women?) will get more work done. If you walk out of an air conditioned building, and experience a sense of relief when the warm (or hot!) air hits your skin, you're wasting money. My solution - keep a hoodie in my office and put it on when the AC's too cold. It also communicates quite clearly to Elsa or whoever it is that controls the thermostat that they've set it too low.
Age is another factor that's not measured here. The test subjects were college students probably mostly in a narrow age range. Old people are kind of notorious for liking the temperature hotter. They tend to compensate as best they can by wearing more clothes.
I have to have a cool to cold room to sleep well. Otherwise, I'm just in a basting oven. The interesting thing about temperature is how we interpret it based on seasons. For the most part, what feels ""good"" at one time of the year will be too hot or too cold for another time of the year. AC usually keeps things ""comparatively"" cool at about 78. But when it gets that warm without AC, we open the doors to cool things down even more (assuming it's cooler outside, which it usually is if we open the doors. In the winter, we'll have space heaters, which keep things a toasty 72 or so, which would be pretty cool in the winter. I've noticed that unless one is in a controlled environment and has no idea how hot or cold things are outside, they tend to be much more subjective about how they feel temperature-wise with respect to comfort levels. I realize this is one more twist on the experiment that wasn't taken into account (at least by my read). But they could have asked afterward what each participant subjectively felt while doing the tests and noted the weather. So, although the results are interesting, it's way too small and exclusive of a sample to be definitive as to the extent of the differences. We can acknowledge that they exist, but not really to what degree (no pun intended). Doing this study repeatedly over the course of a year on a much larger and more varied group would yield more definitive data from which a greater understanding of the impact of these differences could be drawn.
There's a truism in there.
It's technically closer to 1.5°C, but either way you're talking about confidence interval levels of error. I can understand there might be a reasonable difference between 60°F and 80°F, but I don't think I've ever been in an office where it was kept higher than the mid 70s or lower than the high 60s. Is there possibly a difference? Maybe, but it's it really going to stop someone from typing as I've seen some commenters here imply? Seems ridiculous. If you're a man and you feel like 75° is too hot then maybe get thinner slacks or don't wear a jacket all the time. If you're a woman and 69° is too cold maybe wear a sweater, or even get some thin gloves. Office temperature problems unrelated to malfunctions or sociopathic managers seem more like passive aggression than a real issue.
Fascinating. More than anything, this is just a really good reminder that people are freaking complex entities that are extremely difficult to reduce down to simple statistics when something as benign out-of-mind as the thermostat setting can affect performance to a quantifiable measure.
Gee, if only they could invent something warmer than a sweater. Shame such a thing doesn't exist. If it did, maybe humans could colonize places like Russia or Canada, and finally end the control the bears have. /s
Yep. That's a simple concept (indoor temperature should be higher in the summer, and cooler in the winter) that seems really hard to understand for some people. It's hot outside so I need to set the AC to 20°C (sometimes 18), and it's cold outside so I need to set heating to 24°C (or more) are prevalent around here. And when it gets too cold (or two hot) turn it off, that's how you save money.
Just anecdotal, but at my last job, the thermostat discrepancy was worsened by the fact that in the summer time, the dress code was somewhat less strictly followed, particularly for ladies. Women were wearing light summer dresses, skirts, sandals and other warm weather clothes. The men were still having to wear dress clothes and ties, which were uncomfortable and hot. In my office, there were two men and two women. The guys were always hot and wanted the AC up. The ladies were cold and wanted it turned off.
But what do we do about the drop bears of Australia?
So our last hope to fight climate change is IKEA.
The end result is that, if the treated wood absorbs some of the heat of a structure, wood can radiate it away so that it leaves the planet entirely. Great. So now instead of global warming, we'll have solar system warming. /s (This is really neat work. I assume they've filed for a patent.) Last edited by LesDawg on Thu May 23, 2019 6:00 pm
End global warming... with wood?
That cooling effect would only help if you don't paint or weather seal your wood. Or if it grows fungus because you didn't seal it. Here in Florida, untreated wood last about 6 months before it begins to decay into a sponge.
It's late here so I haven't processed this fully. I'm not building any structures anytime soon, but I'm always looking out for a cool computer case. Is there an application there that's better than metal and perspex?
Cutting down forests and regrowing them is actually a great form of carbon capture. Forests that stay untouched are mostly carbon-neutral. New wood absorbs CO2, but decaying wood emits it at the same rate.
Mental image: Treebeard at day spa, getting a blond dye job and a massage, then being sarcastic to the police.
I'm guessing that if removing the lignin and keeping the cellulose makes better biofuel, it also makes the product more flammable. Compression might help with that but I have to wonder whether the net result is less safe than wood.
Interesting how everyone else here seems to have gone with construction, and buildings. The mention of Aluminium made me immediately think of application to computer manufacture. A strong, light material that effectively wicks away heat? Build your 8 core MacBook Pro out of that, and maybe they can get rid of those annoying fans. (Probably not, but, hyperbole for rhetoric effect.)

If they are removing the lignin and leaving the cellulose, could they not use other sources of cellulose, maybe something that grows faster than trees?
How flammable is it? Mind you, I’ve been told that heavy wooden beams for example tend to lag in a house fire, so it’s a relative concern. Strangely enough, when we start thinking about energy reduction systematically, all sorts of ideas pop out of the woodwork and the sky doesn’t fall economically: assuming all the kinks can be worked out, even climate skeptics ought to enjoy their lower utility costs.
My understanding is that this is not the case - pressure treated wood is more environmentally survivable than untreated wood. As someone else mentioned though, the question of whether this stuff would make a viable cladding is important. Seems like leaving it mounted on a building side for a year wouldn't be too difficult to get some rudimentary data (e.g., ""after a week of exposure still radiated as effectively"")
Brilliant!

If this is workable in any large-scale scenario and can last for any significant period of time in real-world scenarios, these folks should be given the keys to every city in the southwestern United States. Imagine putting siding on a house in Arizona that not only keeps the heat away, but actually cools the place while you're away. Shit, I'm in a relatively northern city and I wish that I had this. Brick houses are great for many things. Cooling isn't one of them. Though it does make it possible to entirely passively heat some rooms in the winter. My pops used to live in a house that had a south-westerly facing window with a partial brick wall approximately 6 feet back. Provided a nice bit of warmth in that area and to the room on the other side.
Can't we use a sealant that is transparent to both visible light and most infrared?
All I want to know is... When can I get a MacBook Pro with a wooden case?
Even living in a fairly warm climate, the strength seems more interesting and practically applicable than the admittedly neat cooling characteristic.

Here in Florida, untreated wood last about 6 months before it begins to decay into a sponge. This isn’t really “wood” anymore. It sounds like removing the lignin and compressing the remaining cellulose product causes the individual cellulose chains to bond together, creating a single, massive, almost crystalline structure: Quote: Based on the description of lignin, you'd expect the resulting wood would be weaker. But the chemically treated wood is then compressed. With no cells or lignin to keep them apart, the many oxygen/hydrogen groups that hang off sugars are free to interact with each other, creating a dense hydrogen bonding mesh. This ultimately makes the material much stronger than wood (though the researchers don't compare its strength to that of pressure-treated lumber, which is also stronger than untreated wood). While the end product may have been created from wood, I’m not sure a fungus could break it down and eat it.
How do I put this in layman’s terms you can understand easily? You don’t understand Planck’s law. Hmm, that should do it.
Well, nothing behaves like a perfect blackbody, so no need to invoke Planck's Law. All molecules have their own absorption and emission spectra. It just happens that the molecules in the air are transparent at certain IR wavelengths. Here's a figure from their paper illustrating how this works: Figure A shows the absorption of the ""natural"" (black line) and ""cooling"" (red line) wood with respect to the solar spectrum. The shaded reddish area is the solar radiation after interacting with the atmosphere (ie., atmospheric transmission). The idea is that the solar spectrum peaks in the visible, so that's where most of the energy would get absorbed. However, because the wood has a high albedo (it scatters most of that light), it doesn't absorb visible light from the Sun very efficiently; most of its absorption occurs in the IR, where the solar irradiance is low. In addition, the wood has a high emissivity (Figure B) in the mid-IR (5-25um), so it's efficiently radiating away its internal energy. There are large swaths of wavelength range where the atmosphere is transparent, so those photons will radiate off into the cosmos unless they hit some intervening object. So, given that the only other source of heating is thermal contact with the air (which is not as efficient as radiative heating), this is why the wood generally has a lower effective temperature than the surrounding air.

Maybe it doesn’t matter but do they start with a specific wood like oak? Or is it like particle board made from scraps?
Wait for it.. MacBook Paper.
They’re relying on the existing structure of the wood. You don’t just need cellulose, you need cellulose that’s already organized into the shape you need. They can turn a wood sheet into a treated “cooling wood” sheet, but that’s it. You’ve got to grow something you can cut into sheets or planks before you treat it.
Sounds cool. Questions I'd like answers to: - What is the final density? How much more dense is it than, say, pine? - What kind of wood is used? If lumber pine can be treated this way, great - we've already got an abundant supply. If it only works with, say, ebony, then it's just an interesting novelty. - What about other properties like resistance to warping, or paintability? - What about longevity when exposed to the elements? - Most important, how much would it cost per board foot?
Now if they can make the treated wood unpalatable to termites -specially the Formosan Termite- they'll have a seller product in their hands.
Radiative cooling, non-metallic, light.... I wonder if it might be useful for making spacecraft?
Bamboo springs to mind.
Not unless it's also air-tight.
Couldn't find any specifics in the paper. Just says ""natural wood"" throughout.
Depends on the sort of spacecraft. That's a serious concern for manned craft, but unmanned craft would be fine. Maybe. As the article notes, there are lots of material properties to measure, so things like how thin it can be milled, how well it stands up to machining and vibrational stress, how resistant it is to radiation, all come into play.
The beginnings of the Crystalline Entity.....
Very interesting
Most people, being a bit self-centered, would point to the Ediacaran and Cambrian, when the first animal life appeared and then diversified. Yet studies of DNA suggest that fungi may have originated far earlier than animals. Yes, like most people, that is exactly what I was thinking. Dude, you read us common people like the weather.
A billion here a billion there and pretty soon we're talking real time.
I dunno about that. When I read the first part of that first sentence, I was wondering why ""self-centered"" was used with respect to those eras, because when it comes to ""life"", I always assumed bacterial, single-celled, primitive, starting from amino acids and such kind of life. After the comma it made a sort of sense, but I'd never equated ""life"" with human life or animal life. TIL Shroom ancestors ruled the world a billion years ago and that my confirmation bias of myself being ""common"" is seriously whacked with respect to my way of thinking about the origins of life. I honestly thought everyone else thought of it the same way as I did. Color me surprised.
Personally, (I'd never presume to speak for anyone else) I'm surprised that fungi preceded other forms of multi-cellular life since it is-generally- a land form and not a sea form of life. I would just assume that the ocean was where it all began. Color *me* surprised.
The authors hint that animals may date back that far too (or else, what are the fungi eating?)
Potentially plants or assorted unicellular eukaryotes. We'll handle the decay side of pretty much anything with enough chemical energy to be worth the trouble; and there's a fairly limited difference between bulk unicellular and multicellular organisms from the perspective of waiting for them to die and then breaking them down for energy.

Given some of the chemicals that you produce, I suspect that the ""waiting for them to die"" is a bit disingenuous. Next you will be claiming that you had no idea penicillins do really bad things to bacterial cell walls, and were made purely as training exercises for fungal chemists.
So I'm reading this right, and the microfossils being discussed are thought to be the non-mineralized remnants of actual chitin? And nearly a billion years old? I need to sit down...
Someone told them to build a (cell) wall....

Many credit your group (for better or worse) with instigating religious experience.
Also there is the current genocide against the amphibs that has many observers quite concerned.
According to Wikipedia (I know, grain of salt), the previous record holder for oldest preserved chitin is a 25 million year old insect encased in amber. Talk about blowing through a previous record.
It is not just a wall but four walls, ceiling and floor, so more like a box......
People routinely dis Wikipedia but a close friend had his botany class try to add to it in about 2010. If the student managed to get the information to ""stick"" it was worth an A. Only one student managed to make it happen. He has edited pages and had the mods come back and ask for credentials, only then would the info stick. Its not like the early days when any idiot could put some junk in there and make it stick (a positive outcome of the evolution/creation battle! religious nutters are every fuckin' where!) Wikipedia is a pretty good source now.
It’s a pretty good source, but there is still plenty that is simply wrong. Typically not out-of-left-field wrong, but something like the oldest surviving chitin specimen could easily be wrong, in my experience. Especially since it’s sort of an aside in the article on chitin, so not necessarily on someone’s radar to update when new specimens are discovered. Frankly, I’m a little surprised if someone couldn’t make an edit “stick” in Wikipedia. My experience is that credentials are unnecessary if the information is properly referenced. But, of course, the culture in different areas of study does vary. My favorite is that the classical music guys use info boxes on their articles, except that the opera guys think info boxes are ugly, so refuse to allow them on opera-related articles (as though “ugly” is a reason to leave out useful data from an encyclopedia article). :shrug:
I'm completely unsurprised that opera nerds get all melodramatic about style over substance.
Although not quite an opera nerd (merely a buff), I would prefer an uncostumed cast on a unadorned stage of a good opera sung well than see a lavish production of a mediocre opera sung well. Substance does matter, at least to me and my wife.
I always knew fungi are completely alien to us and shouldn't trusted. That is why I can't stand mushrooms
Juffo-Wup is the power of life... hot warmth in the cold Void. It flows through all things, binding them together, making them one. You are Non-Juffo-Wup, you cannot understand. We look to Juffo-Wup for direction, and it provides the pattern -- endless expansion with purity of achievement and intolerance of error.
Don't forget the (occasional) yeast! Back on topic, this is pretty astounding work.
First, we're not quite certain when multicellular life really begun. Grypania fossils are about 2bn years old, although we 're not certain what kind of organism it was. It is generally accepted it's an algae, so the answer to your question is that multicellular life indeed begun in the oceans - as what we now call protists. Second, Fungi aren't really a land life form. Even though most species now live away from water, they are generally very sensitive to sunlight, drought, dust etc. Yet, they are the masters of symbiosis and it's this trait that enabled them to colonize the land. They form extensive and very complicated symbiotic relations with pretty much every other kingdom, always depending on their partners for the essentials of land survival.
Also, as we learn more about soil fungi we realize that most of them aren't saprophytes at all. They 're actually hunters. Until very recently we could only watch their eating habbits in sterilized petri dishes, where they appeared as decomposers of dead matter - because that's what we fed them. When we observe the same fungi in the soil, we almost always find that they're actually fierce predators of worms, protists etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHgxM2HVnkQ This doesn't mean that dedicated decomposers don't exist. It just means that we have only started understanding fungi. And of course, they 're among the most prolific parasites. It's the flip coin of their symbiotic abilities and, again, we are only beginning to understand the impact they have on Life in general. For example, there's a theory that warm bloodedness evolved under the volutionary pressure of fungi. Mammals and birds have the warmest bodies and are seldom infected. Reptiles and amphibians, on the other hand, are often decimated.
I wonder what these would taste like, fried in butter...
Yes, that's what I assumed ""life"" in general originally was. I wasn't speaking of the shrooms being the original life. It was only a billion years old, and I figured that was one of the first multi-cellular forms like you said and the quote stated. I didn't mean that the shrooms were either the original life, nor the first multi-cellular life (just possibly one of the latter). I figure there was probably an abundance of multi-cellular life by the time the shrooms came on the scene. Only finding evidence of that in the fossil record is going to be very problematic. It seems were it not for the chitin in the shrooms, they, too, may have gone unnoticed in the fossil record. Apologies for being unclear. I was trying to keep my post word count below 1000 like I usually do.
This is interesting also from the point of view of Fermi paradox. If complex, multi cellular life arouse earlier in history, it makes it more likely that such things happens in other planets too. And it makes it less likely to be (one of) the filters that make other civilizations less common in the universe. Also, it would mean that complex life did survive even the snowball earth periods.
Quote: Shrooms' relatives beat us to multicellularity by a healthy margin. Quote: When did the first complex multicellular life arise? Most people, being a bit self-centered, would point to the Ediacaran and Cambrian, when the first animal life appeared and then diversified. Yet studies of DNA suggest that fungi may have originated far earlier than animals. I can't, obviously, speak for ""most people"" but I needed a reminder that multicellularity arose more than once, and arose separately in plants, animals and fungi - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicell ... ry_history But I'm finding it hard to reconcile this with the notion that *all* animals are multicellular by definition (as per the Wikipedia article on animals). Yeasts seem to be classified as unicellular fungi. How should I understand John's ""fungi may have originated far earlier than animals""? Multicellular fungi only? Or have yeasts lost multicellularity at some point? Struggling here!
Now, it makes me wonder what they tasted like, sauteed in butter with a pinch of garlic...
Hi John. I think the article should point out that fungi are thought to have first evolved in the ocean (possibly as early as 2.4 billion years ago) and that finding early aquatic fungus fossils is therefore less surprising than it might seem without that datum. Fungi were definitely around during the (mid to late) Cambrian. That's when it is thought that they began colonizing the land masses and beginning the slow process of soil formation, preparing the environment for the later appearance of land plants and animals. Finding 1 billion year old primitive fungus fossils in an estuary doesn't really surprise me in that context. Rather it's a fascinating piece in the puzzle of the evolution of complex life on Earth, and it fits the emerging picture well.
Google ""protists"". They are the verified ancestors of both animals and plants, although their relation with fungi is much more obscure. It's a polyphyletic group, which means they don't all share the same ancestry, so the term itself is a bit of misnomer. They 're mostly unicellular eucaryotic organisms and their diversity is astounding. You 'll find them everywhere there's water. The important thing about them is that they always form colonies and mini ecosystems. In some cases the members of the colony become so entangled that some cells begin to diversify and play the roles of organs. Check out ""Volvox"". It's a spherical ""social"" photosynthetic algae. When the colony reaches a certain size (typically some hundreds), the inner cells begin to diversify and produce either male or female gametes. What was once a unicellular algae effectively becomes a (very) primitive plant. We 've seen similar things happening with protists that come together and become (very) primitive ""animals"". It's possibe that something similar led to the evolution of fungi (although to my knowledge it hasn't been verified yet). The important thing here is to remember that multicellularity is (evolutionary speaking), nothing novel. It happens all the time but only a few combinations work effectively enough to be permanent fusions. I strongly suggest Margulis' book ""Acquiring Genomes"". Although very long in the tooth by now, it remains unique in describing how natural selection and symbiotic relations pretty much pushed life to increased complexity, sex and even invented death.
Yet studies of DNA suggest that fungi may have originated far earlier than animals. DNA suggests that fungi and animals are sister taxa, neither could have originated earlier than the other. A lineage literally split into fungi and animals
After all these years, probably tastes like shitake....best to eat fresh not billion year old, that's the morel of the story.
FWIW the classic formulation of the Drake equation doesn’t include a coefficient for “complex life,” it basically treats it as embedded within the “intelligent life” factor.
That date makes it nearly as old as the oldest plant fossils of red algae at 1.6 billion years [ http://www.sci-news.com/paleontology/ol ... 04700.html ]. As linked to, multicellularity evolved many times independently - 30+ if you count spore forms - and complex such a handful of times - 6 or 7 if you arguably count a clade of cyanobacteria diversifying some non-replicator nitrogen fixating cells within its sheathed colonies. ADDED: I checked the current best fossil/genome integrated tree [ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0644-x ], and it has the Animal/Fungi split at 1.3 billion years old and plants split out at 1.6 so is roughly consistent so far. Of course more details would improve the dates, but not too bad as far as these things go.   And for good measure animals produce plant homologous cellulose and fungi homologous syncytia (poly-nucleated cells) as well; IIRC we do both in our larger muscles.
I accidentally did this the other night in my kitchen with an instant pot, it was delicious.
Cool
When I first read about this, I said, ""oh, we've gone from low temperature superconductors to high pressure superconductors!"" But, the physics is still pretty neat.
It's actually starting to look vaguely possible that we could have room temperature semiconductors. Like John said I think the most impressive thing is that they were able to predict the material before trying it, and the material matched expectations. That's huge because we don't fully understand superconductivity yet. But we're augering in.
That's awesome we are finally making some progrwss on higher temp superconductors might finally lead to something where we don't have to use liquid He in MRIs.
But how would you relax for your scan without that high pitched whooshing lullaby in the background?
A million atmospheres of pressure? Easy. The way we jam stuff in the freezer at home, and by the look of some of the....more exotic states that our frozen veg has taken on I'm sure we passed a million atm a few years back.
Maybe the theoreticians who predicted that metallic hydrogen would be a superconductor were smoking the right stuff after all, both for the metallic phase, which may well have been observed, and for the superconducting, which gets at least an honorable mention here even with the 9.09 mol% lanthanum contamination, which may be screwing up the transition temperature for superconducting, whilst lowering it for metallization.
My ice chest is so packed I'm sure whatever is at the bottom has turned into ice II by now.
Isn't compressing hydrogen how you eventually end up with fusion? Time to look up if there have been any studies about superconductivity in stars...
That's easy! Just make the gradients louder to compensate. Realistically though even just being able to switch to liquid nitrogen would be a massive boon.
As long as its not ice 9....
The DOI doesn't work, so here's a URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01113.pdf
Just stop before you get to ice-9. Edit: ninja'd by Veritas super omens.
I would think the temperature would be far too high for anything like that to happen. Interesting idea, though.
Had nearly the same thought but about Jupiter, though after a little researching I came to the same conclusion that someone mentions below about the temperature probably being too high.
I was thinking more along the lines of cold fusion, er, low-energy nuclear reactions. Regardless of whether that actually takes place, the first step is to deuterium-load the metal (eg palladium) lattice. I wonder if something similar to super-load the e.g. lanthanum hydride with extra hydrogen would be equivalent to squeezing it under high pressure. Probably not exactly, but it might be an experiment worth pursuing.
Don't worry, the keening of thousands of diamond anvils under pressure couldn't possibly bother anyone...
Could be a soultion to global warming!
https://physicsworld.com/a/neutron-star ... luid-core/ There is also a concept known as color superconductivity that involves Cooper-paired quarks rather than electrons and that may possibly be going on in the cores of neutron stars, but that's a lot less understood and a lot less certain.
Wouldn't this fall under type 1 superconductor that is quite well explained by the BCS theory rather than type 2 where cuprates and co hang out?
This is an exciting discovery. Conversation at the dinner table should be interesting tonight... Dad: Researchers have discovered a form of superconductivity that occurs 250 Kelvins. Kids: I found a new cat video on YouTube. Dad: Ugh
I know; Dads' priorities can be so out of whack sometimes.
Hmmm, lets rotate the entire setup and rotate the deuterium then (swap) magnetism polarity by adding more magnets and then spark it with the hydrogen fusion. Could I levitate??
Type-I and Type-II superconductivity are both consistent with BCS (the distinction has to do with how easily magnetic flux lines penetrate vs. the typical size of a Cooper pair of electrons), and both are seen in normal metals (niobium, for instance, is Type-II). You're probably thinking about s-wave vs. p-wave pairing, which has to do with the radial symmetry of the pairing and indeed is one of the reasons that conventional BCS doesn't work well for explaining the cuprates. For this material, they weren't able to measure magnetization curves (sample volume was too small, unsurprisingly given the constraints of the high pressure environment) but at least in principle determining Type-I vs. Type-II would be straightforward by looking at magnetization vs. field curves. Determining the pairing symmetry would be a lot more difficult. The usual way, of imaging a single crystal with a scanning tunneling microscope, is obviously impossible.
Nice but as far as practical applications, high pressure is more difficult then low temperature
""The catch? You need about a million atmospheres of pressure."" That's kind of a big catch.
A few years back, researchers found that a high-pressure form of hydrogen sulfide would superconduct at 203K (-70°C) Just for the record: as pretty much every laboratory molecular biologist can testify from first-hand experience, a -80°C freezer itself ain't no big whoop. Pretty much standard equipment for a molbio lab. Back when I was buying such things, a ""minus-80"" the size of a typical kitchen refrigerator/freezer would set you back about $6K. I personally would call a minus-80 ""a good freezer."" I'd call a minus-20 a ""home freezer.""
The DOI works for me (but I am following it within an academic library, so that might make a difference). The paper on arXiv is not the same paper. None of the authors are the same, none of the participating institutions are the same, the abstract is different, and the length is different (28pp on arXiv, 13pp on Nature). It's almost like there are two groups who discovered this almost simultaneously. When I have more free time, I'll have to read both papers and see how their results differ. [edit] The arXiv paper (Kruglov) cites an earlier paper by the authors of the Nature paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07039, Drozdov) discussing lanthanum hydrides superconducting at 216K, and cites a subsequent paper by a third group (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07695, Somayazulu) saying there was evidence of 260K superconducting in superhydrides (like LaH10). I think the two Drozdov papers are experimental, and the Kruglov and Somayazulu papers are more theoretical. I haven't really read them yet. Last edited by Buddha Buck on Wed May 22, 2019 2:06 pm
My workplace just bought a laboratory type (thermo-fisher) refrigerator. It might go to -80 , I don't know, but the reason we paid $7K for it was the temperature recording and verification feature. Its important for some vaccines and other biological medications to stay within very tight temperature tolerances.
""as superconducting materials are difficult and expensive to manufacture, requiring a constant bath of liquid nitrogen to keep them cold enough to operate."" - I think you meant to say liquid helium. Liquid nitrogen is not cold enough for most super conductors. Also this is cool to hear about new discovery's in regards to supper conductors. As far as I know currently this is nothing that says we can't have room temperature supper conductors. If we get something close I can't think of any reasonable discovery in the next few life times (other than ai) that will propel us into a true comic book si-fi future with hover boards and flying cars.
But it doesn't require continuous power input... unlike cooling. It's static.
I assume the amount of resistance in the diamond anvils and wiring all the way to the meter is measured and removed by calculation, to say there was no resistance between them when the material started superconducting. Maybe a stupid question but how do they know the compound went superconductive rather than the anvils just squeezing the material out of the way and making direct contact? Is there an obvious gap between the anvils at that pressure?
Pretty sure they know the displacement of the anvils to within a micrometer or so.
Well, if you really want to go for blindly optimistic futurism, find a way to mass-produce muon-antimuon pairs. Swap the protons with the antimuons, and you get muonium (which has about 1/8 the mass of hydrogen IIRC, and therefore vibrates at higher freqencies), and as a bonus you get muon-proton pairs to use for muon-catalyzed fusion. ((Twice as blindly optimistic when you consider that the ability to produce that many muon-antimuon pairs whenever you want means fusion reactors and room temperature superconductors would both be comparatively useless toys by comparison))
My complaint is I tell mine to stop spending so much time on on their phone with stuff like tumblr and Facebook and their response is ‘dad I don’t even have those on my phone’. My only thought being ‘out of that collection of words that is what you took as the important part requiring comment?!’ Though thinking back to some of my recent pedantic posts I see where they get it from.
They used a four-wire resistance technique (the van der Pauw method to be precise), which eliminates lead and contact resistance issues. Re the second question, there is a gap between the anvils, of a few tens of microns. Diamond cells work by having two opposed diamonds and then a metallic (usually hardened steel or similar) gasket in between. A small hole drilled in the center of the gasket forms the pressure chamber which is filled with a liquid or gas (hydrogen for this experiment), which converts the uniaxial force from the diamonds into a hydrostatic pressure. You can look through a microscope and check for deformation of the hole, which is an early warning sign of a failure like the anvils hitting each other (which is Bad; it usually leads to getting emails that start with ‘one of the diamonds just exploded’...)
Exploding Diamonds would be an awesome name for a prog rock band....
I like to tell people that this line of research proves that the famous deBeers advertising slogan is a lie.
Wow. I'm glad exploration on the Moon is international. The Chinese have developed a novel and clever way to explore the far side. Credit where credit's due. I hope cooperation is the result of nations venturing out past LEO.
I was about to say something similar. Let's not argue about national pride and just be happy science is happening on the moon again.
It's not really 'novel', just a bit trickier and daring. It's not something that couldn't have been done before, it's just that nobody wanted to do it. Kudos to the Chinese for a fine accomplishment.
So NASA got it backwards, rather than ""seeking a Grail"" its GRAIL is seeking.....
No, I'd say they got it right. How'd that seeking the grail stuff turn out?
Last I heard they were running away from the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog....
Sorry I can't give up hope that we'll find a way to make peace. I used to be as cynical as you seem to be, but looking into a bottomless well doesn't comport with my present outlook. I agree that H. sapiens likely acheived supremacy by the standard you posit. You might be right, but I sure hope not. edit: On the other hand, I recall Bullwinkle Moose stating, ""Let a smile be your umbrella... If you like to gargle rain."" Guilty of hoping...

Just pointing out the DOI link is to Nature, not Science.
It is exciting if we have access to the moon mantle and can verify and refine Moon/planet models. But I want to have the material for dating the lunar impact record, which is a proxy for dating old surfaces throughout the system. If it turns out later craters reset/contaminated the impact clocks of the Aitken basin, this will be a problem.
Exactly. Unfortunately because it's a Chinese achievement, you won't see anywhere near the same number of comments here at Ars, and Eric Berger noticeably has nothing to do with reporting it as usual... But science is science is science. We should cheer any peaceful achievement done in the name of gaining knowledge, no matter who does it. We should if nothing else cheer this because of China opening up it's scientific results, something they previously haven't been too keen on doing. And you should be more, not less appreciative if you think China is a totalitarian, militaristic state: this can prove to them that there's another way to get credit and respect... as long as it is indeed genuinely given. Not that China doesn't know this themselves, they're busy scooping up as much of the soft power we've abandoned that they can, in Africa and elsewhere. But with more and more warning bells that we're going to make the same appalling, mass murdering mistake as in 2003, but this time on an even bigger scale, whilst simultaneously starting a trade war directly with China, we shouldn't be so certain we'll have much to cheer about ourselves for ever either... So science folks? Wisdom? Knowledge? And settling our differences in less fatal ways please? Let's hear it for Change 4 then...?
I humbly submit that the definition of novel is that no one has done it before...? Otherwise agree.
So, we shouldn't have any political notions about this story but you bring up politics anyway. You have a strange concept of 'we'.
Putting a relay sat in halo orbit to make a landing on the far side of the moon is novel. Novel doesn't mean something nobody else could have done it means something new that nobody else HAS done.
Don't mind Hobbit he will find any way to both bash the US and throw personal insults at Eric in any article related to space. If nobody does what he wants he just makes up strawmen in order to get his attacks in.

What the fuck are you talking about? We had lunar orbiters in the 60s, but they had all crashed into the moon or gone dead by the time humans got there (they were used for mapping potential landing sites). The closest thing to a lunar communications relay satellite was the command/service module. I guess technically you could call that a relay satellite, though the lunar lander could and usually did talk directly to Earth. The Chinese have done a damn fine job, and in a road-less-traveled way. Give them the credit they deserve.
I don’t care about the flags waving so much as the fucking cool fact that we can see mantle rocks on the surface of the moon. It’s not exactly a surprise; we had spectra of the basin by 20 years ago. But we’d never seen them up close like now.
NASA:. ""Its impossible launch and navigate a rover on the far side of the moon."" Space X then secretly donates a few starlinks, and launches them around the moon, and therefore sealing future moon missions with NASA.
The moon: The next Atacama, but for geologists. ...ok, we can have a few telescopes up there too.
If it's half pyroxene, half olivine, ""most of the other half"" instead of ""nearly half"" could be less confusing. Both pyroxene and olivine are complex groups of minerals that have very different compositions within each group, some have magnesium, iron, aluminum, sodium, chromium, manganese, vanadium, lithium, calcium, some don't. And some have other trace elements too. I am not sure how the Chinese spectrometer model could recognize all of these varieties of pyroxene and olivine rather than specific minerals in these groups, or several different minerals with the same elements altogether. I understand that their model exclude minerals that are not likely to be found in these mantle samples, but it seems an extraordinary feat to achieve such precision on such imprecise minerals. But then, scientists of any nation are not ordinary people...
Why is there an obsession with the Moon & telescopes? It appears to make little sense until humanity can make them there, and it may not even make sense at that point. It takes an additional approximate 5.67 km/s Delta-V to go from LEO to the moon (from a circa 250km orbit that requires around 9.4 km/s Delta-V). So without in-orbit refueling any telescope that lands on the moon would be very small and relatively immovable (compared to a telescope in space either orbiting a Lagrange point or Earth) due to the rocket equation & because the moon has no atmosphere. And if in-orbit refueling has been mastered then it'd be easier & less expensive to just refuel the station-keeping propellants (if the telescope wasn't placed in a stable orbit) and so extend the life of the larger more easily maneuverable (and so more capable) in-space telescope. Maintenance isn't an issue in space any more than it would be on the Moon - it'd be difficult in both places. I don't get the attraction of the moon over space for telescopes? Any help you could give on this would be much appreciated
This is an excellent question. I believe there are pros and cons for both space based and Luna based telescopes. One of the huge benefits of space based is a nearly full view of the “sky”. However, gyroscopes and reaction wheels are a life limiting issue with telescopes. With a Luna based telescope, there is a firm foundation allowing much simpler and cheaper tracking motors. Ground based mounting and tracking hardware is significantly more mature as a technology and as a result cheaper. One can argue that size will be a limiting factor Luna based telescopes versus space. In theory this is true, but Hubble is still the largest non-secret squirrel space based imager out there, and has been for decades. In those intervening years “we” have built many telescopes that are larger than the James Webb will be, and cheaper too. Maintenance is also an issue. While we have had several repair/upgrade missions for the Hubble, The majority of space based telescopes are not repairable. This is also a main issue with the James Webb Telescope. Part of its insane build time and costs is because it will be going out to an orbit that is currently unaccessible to humans, and it has to work properly from the beginning and cannot be fixed if anything goes wrong. While the same can currently be said of Lunar based telescopes(no current human access), if/when we go back to the moon maintenance issues would be simpler. Also, due to current technology the support structure of space based telescopes have to withstand being launched on a rocket fully assembled, so there are no savings in mass due to zero/microgravity.

You don’t recognize individual minerals with a spectrometer, you just get a curve. Now you have a curve, and you know you were looking at rocks, so you can assume it’s made of minerals. You can also assume a uniform Italian uniformitarian view to say it’s going to be mostly minerals we know about. Ok, now we have spectra from the lab of samples carefully prepared to be all one mineral, and we know how mixed minerals combine their spectra. Now make some guesses as to the components. That’s all automated, at the end you get some possible guesses. This was standard practice you’d give an undergrad lab to do, 20 years ago (expect you’d make them do it by hand and you’d know the answer).

Unless we all destroy ourselves, I think that, eventually, we will have research stations and activity on the moon just like we do in places like Antarctica. This research will include telescopes on the far side of the moon that never have to worry about radio pollution from the Earth as well as other kinds of observatories. Perhaps we could make a much larger LIGO style gravity observatory there. With less gravity or atmosphere, I’m sure that would allow much larger and more sensitive instruments.

I think we may have already screwed up the notion of ""radio telescopes on the back side of the moon"". With the Chinese Queqiao relay sat. in lunar L2 along with NASA's ARTEMIS P1 & P2 , and the James Webb going into earth L2. Lagrange points seem to be so useful, and already accessable, that by the time we get around to installing a radio telescope on the moon, it might not be viable. (unless we could all agree to have all communication equipment in view of the back side of the moon be laser based only)
One of the paths to an upgrade to LIGO & VIRGO is planned to be space-based- the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) project. In space it'll be possible to place the various instruments much further apart (proposed 2.5 million km) which will improve accuracy/sensitivity much more than is possible on both Earth & the Moon. As this concepts accuracy will go beyond even the 3rd generation replacements of LIGO & VIRGO and as it can be implemented in a shorter time-frame, it's doubtful that the 3rd gen. Earth-based concepts will be implemented. There has even been preliminary testing of the space-based concept - which passed with flying colors.
Don’t you mean “orbiting colors “? I’ll see myself out.

I'm looking forward to the time, not very long in the future, when we'll fire big pyroxene lozenges from a mass driver to a rotating hab at EML1, where we'll refine the material into various finished metal products and ship it to other habs under construction around cislunar space. Bwahahahahahaha! (rubs hands together)
They'll use ionic liquids to extract metals and water from the regolith.
Hey! At what point did it visit my ex?
I think there's a unit error in there, probably meant to write ""50 m across"".
typo ""which allowed it to capture images that could resolve features 50km across (and, in some cases, even smaller)"" I'm assuming it's 50m. As the whole object is ~50km in size Edit: Ah ninja'd. I'm too slow
I suspect that resolution number is perhaps 50m or maybe 50cm and not km. Otherwise wouldn't photographs of Ultima Thule be a single pixel? Edit: also ninja'd twice.

Apologies if this is a noob question, but can anyone explain the mechanism by which Ultima and Thule adhered to each other? I get that gravitational forces (though small, as stated in the article) were enough to attract the two initially, but how did they become fused? I'm aware of cold-welding, but from everything I've seen, it's only been observed/performed on various metals (iron, gold, silver, etc.). Is that what's in play here or is it something else? Edit: ""Gently fused by gravity"" --Thanks Stuart! Last edited by Glossome on Thu May 16, 2019 6:19 pm
""The team unveiled new images received late in the day yesterday, and it’s now clear that Ultima Thule, a distant, icy Kuiper Belt Object lying 4 billion miles away, is a contact binary. That means it is a single object, with two lobes, but the lobes are gently in contact. The scenario to form such a body is that probably numerous small planetesimals came together in the outer solar system in a small region early on, the two of them more or less nudged together, gently fused by gravity. This created a snowman-shaped, two-lobed binary object."" http://www.astronomy.com/news/2019/01/u ... aft-images

No it isn't. Nitrogen melts at 63K and boils at 77. Methane at 91K and 112K. Perhaps we need remedial work in vapor pressure and sublimation pressure, hmm? -signed: Your physical chemistry TA from hell. /jest
Stupid question: do these melting and boiling temperatures apply in a vacuum?
Not so stupid. Melting temperature does, boiling point is pressure dependent. I'll post a phase diagram in a bit, and invite further discussion. Edit: Here's a phase diagram for methane: As you can see, methane requires at least a tenth atmosphere (~76mm Hg) to exist as liquid. Vacuum of space doesn't qualify, so on Ultima Thule methane would behave more like dry ice we're familiar with here on earth's surface.: as a solid that sublimates directly to gas. From Methane thermodynamic properties we find more precisely, Methane's triple point is 90.67K at 0.117 bar, with critical point 190.6K at 46 bar. The latter means that methane cannot exist as liquid at any pressure, at temperatures above 190.6K; at Ultima Thule we could only see solid or gas. Since it's a comparatively small body, and no methane (or nitrogen) was detected, one assumes that any primordial deposits of these ices have long since sublimated. Pluto of course is much larger; give it sunshine and time. But speaking of nitrogen, the article mentions both, and both it might expected to be. In which case the phase diagram becomes a bit more interesting: Phase diagram for methane-nitrogen ice mixtures Now, aren't you glad you asked?

From hydrogen fusing to helium and then to higher and higher elements in the belly of a star, to being spit out in that star's eventual explosion and swirling around in a dust cloud until they formed into two rocks who slowly embraced each other, the atoms that make up this object have seen some amazing natural phenomena at work.
Nova had a good show on the efforts to find something for New Horizons to meet up with after it's previous job. It was interesting how difficult it is to find small rock objects in a given path.
They also did a marvellous job of airing the program very shortly after the flyby when the event was still in the news cycle. We need lots more programming like NOVA.
On Ultima or Thule Og can throw the spear many planetismal lengths, assuming he gets his throw in before being freeze dried.
Well,now you know at least three Arsians think that your aunt is hot.
Spoiler alert for those of you reading this 200 - 300 years from now, when a giant space cloud threatens to destroy the Earth: N'orizons is really New Horizons
I am curious about what dynamic process produced the pancake shape Ultima. One would suspect that rotation might do that, especially with a poorly consolidated body with very low gravitational energy. However Thule appears to be attached to the rim, suggesting very little if any rotational energy by the time the two bodies merged. One can speculate that perhaps before the collision Ultima had rigidified somewhat, possibly due to a process analogous to crystal growth in cement hardening, or possibly loss of volatile nitrogen or methane ices removed the lubricant required for easier flow.
Can anyone explain what this means? Is there a word missing? Is the author saying they are similarly sized? (Maybe this is some idiom with which I'm unfamiliar?) Also, I'm a little surprised the 50km typo hasn't been addressed by now.
I would love to see more of these types of probes launched today with today's technology.
They have to freeze the designs before a launch, years in advance, and prefer to use well tested hardware that can exist in the operating environments required and work. Spacecraft that don't actually meet the specifications have failed in the past. There are usually a few unmanned projects in work at any time around the world. Lots of countries are doing very cool work, usually with partners. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of ... xploration Anyway, by the time any probe is launched, it has at least 4, perhaps 10 yr old technology.
Nice theory. Are you a retired planetary scientist? Or just speculating? As you said, the disk was spinning at one time (almost certainly). Accretion, at an early stage, could be flattened by this (long before gravity takes over as the shaping force). Thule's presence may have slowed and stopped the spin ""freezing"" Ultima in it's present shape. Water ice ( and some other ices) accrete on the object, further solidifying it's shape, etc..

I believe it is referring to the joined area between the objects. As in, there are no large possible craters in the neck of Ultima Thule. Edit: dwrd's explanation sounds more plausible... Last edited by eldowr on Thu May 16, 2019 10:27 pm
It's in reference to the Maryland crater and the 1 km pits. That's all there is, there is nothing in between the big crater and the little ones in size.
Why do they need to be renamed?
""That crater has been nicknamed ""Maryland,"" and other surface features have been tagged with the names of states where the New Horizons team works. (All of these names are temporary and will almost certainly be replaced.)"" Why do they need to be renamed? Because we haven't picked a theme yet, and I somehow doubt 'US states' will be in the running when we do. Quote: When the first images of the surface of a planet or satellite are obtained, themes for naming features are chosen and names of a few important features are proposed, usually by members of the appropriate IAU task group. Ref: International Astronomical Union edit: punctuation fixes
Well when the error is resolution is so fine as to only allow imaging objects larger than the entire object, it is a rare reader that misses it. I think the first two got it right and 50m resolution is right, given that closest approach was 3,500km. An NRO reconnaissance satellite might be able to resolve to 50cm, but I doubt that this probe carried optics that sophisticated. --another one very late to the party
Don't you mean she is cool?
Missing a specific size for crater Maryland. This was in reference to crater Maryland and smaller pits that are around 1km in size. The sentence says that crater Maryland is much larger and there are no pits with intermediate sizes between Maryland diameter and 1km diameter.
But that's not strictly true-- is there any theory covering that circular feature so apparent on Ultima? It looks almost like an ancient weathered impact crater, but may be related to some other process. It kind of looks like another ""neck seam"" like the one between the current bodies.
Are you looking at the same feature? It is obviously a hatch (poorly) disguised as an impact feature.
As I (an amateur) first looked at the hi-res photos of UT, I was most amazed at the ""blob"" which seemed to cover most of the facing-side of the larger lobe (Ultima). Slightly-darker than the underlying surface, it appears to have almost melted and 'oozed' outwards like a Kilauea lava flow. It has height, and definite boundaries. I am curious whether it was somehow a 'mushball' object which gently impacted Ultima and spread out before losing its fluid-like properties. Also, there is a semi-circular, lighter-grey 'band' near the volumetric center of the ""blob."" Could this be the location of the original contact-point? (Ultima does seem much too small to have any form of gravitational-separation of elements.)
The problem is that the path is projected against a really dense star field and you're looking for objects substantially fainter than the average star ... on the other hand, this does mean that there are likely to be good occultation opportunities for any object we do find, so we will have some sort of vague idea of the shape (and a very precise measurement of the position) before the encounter.
I do wonder if the ""redundant"" DNA serves as a genetic ""error buffer"" of sorts... Namely, a certain number of genetic errors occur over time, and ""harmless"" errors in non-functional genes absorb some of those chances. Also, it's not clear if errors in non-functional genes would lead to a block in transcription into a new copy, thus preventing error propagation. Perhaps this explains why the genetically altered bacteria with fewer genes reproduced more slowly...
Redundancy is probably important for evolution. Some changes become more likely than others, some might tweak the DNA a little bit without actually altering the proteins. Safe variability provides different starting points for evolutionary experiments (in the sense of random mutations that undergo selection pressure). Also, I think that picture looks a lot more like E. muppeti than E. coli, but maybe that's just me.

Yes, but did they actually pay for WinRar?
It sounds like Earth DNA is the x86 of DNA: ugly, inefficient, poorly thought out... and yet the most popular architecture by a wide margin. And, attempts to replace it come with performance penalties
It would make manufacture of proteins with unusual properties much easier. Not a huge deal just yet since designing proteins (let alone unnatural ones) is still very hard to do. Could also be useful for isolating transgenic individuals from a larger population since their genetic codes could be made incompatible. Not important for e coli, but I guess if you're going to eventually design more complex organisms making their genes incompatible with nature might be useful.
It's a hybrid of gzip and ogg vorbis stuffed into an mkv and then run through Pro-C.
From ""compress"" in the headline, I thought they had shortened the genome, throwing out non-coding/regulating and redundant stretches, rather than what it turned out, of turning something like ""axbxcxdxexfxg"" into axbxcxdxexaxb (where codons f and g code for the same amino acids as a and b, and x doesn't code for anything).   Just curious: Were those ~18,000 all of the instances of those two codes in the genome? Most?
We know some (few) organisms use additional amino acids, e.g. http://www.yalescientific.org/2009/10/e ... ino-acids/ Work has already been done on freeing up some codes, e.g. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/819 Some longer discussion: https://www.quantamagazine.org/is-a-big ... -20180102/
I think also that there is something called gene expression so certain parts can be turned on and off. So the redundancy is important and it may be key for organisms to adapt to changing conditions so they dont have to reinvent the wheel each time that environment changes over generations
All of them, since they were able to then remove the corresponding tRNAs without any impact on viability.
This is some fantastic engineering work. A simple-to-describe achievement that takes what was a thought experiment not so long ago into a reality. The perspective or reusing the codons for synthetic amino acids is so powerful too with such a strain. Thanks for the report, John!
I swear we are going to see the first genetic CVE any day now.
As an example, a synthetic amino acid with useful fluorescence properties could be introduced. This would be beneficial for studying protein/ligand binding interactions (currently we use the inherent fluorescence properties of tryptophan, which is not always convenient, or modify the protein with a dye after isolation).

Careful. Apparently suggesting fucking around and making E. coli better isn't popular among the ""but it's cool science"" crowd.
The article asked: Quote: Is this redundancy useful? The answer is ""sometimes."" For example, many DNA sequences do double-duty, encoding both a protein and regulatory information that controls gene activity or allowing specific RNA structures to form. The flexibility of redundancy makes it easier for one sequence to serve two purposes. The redundancy can also allow fine-tuning of gene activity, as some codes are translated into proteins more efficiently than others. These factors suggest that the genetic code's redundancy could have evolved to be essential for an organism. There are numerous additional reasons for there to be four different bases and three bases per codon. I don't know the full basis for all the reasons, even the following three: 1) With four bases and three bases per codon, there are 4**3 = 64 possible amino acids, as the article points out. Cut the number of bases per codon to two and there are only 4**2=16 possible amino acids, yet life uses 20. Two is not enough bases per codon. 2) OK, cut the number of bases to two and wind out the number of bases per codon to five. Now you have 2**5=32 possible amino acids; enough. Here I'm bereft of a full explanation of why two bases would not do. I suppose complimentary strands of DNA could be made with two bases (for stability, it's critical for DNA to be two strands wound together and one base couldn't form complimentary strands nor could it encode anything). However, with five bases per codon, transfer RNAs would have to expose five bases to add amino acids together: could they get close enough for two acids to condense to a peptide bond? Would they be more complicated in order to stabilize the face of the bases? The DNA and RNA would be five thirds longer; would this be a problem? 3) The Wobble hypothesis. Ribosomes, where mRNA is paired with tRNA to make protein, can only check proper alignment of the first two of the three bases in a codon. So there are multiple codons per amino acid. The rules are: Quote: If A is at the 3rd position in the codon it can base pair with U or I, if either of these is present at the 1st position in the anticodon. If U is at the 3rd position in the codon it can base pair with A, G or I, if either of these is present at the 1st position in the anticodon. If G is at the 3rd position in the codon it can base pair with C or U, if either of these is present at the 1st position in the anticodon. If C is at the 3rd position in the codon it can base pair with G or I, if either of these is present at the 1st position in the anticodon. [5] I is the nucleoside Inosine that is formed in tRNA by the removal of an amino group from adenosine. [6] A process that is carried out by an enzyme called anticodon deaminase. There are 32 possible amino acids after accounting for wobble. The redundancy can also increase the effective copy number of tRNAs that encode for a particularly prevalent amino acid.
Three, actually. Two serine sense codons, which made up the bulk of the 18000 codons, and for good measure, a few hundred instances of the UAG / amber stop codon. The latter of which had been done before. Last edited by wschmied on Wed May 15, 2019 7:13 pm
I agree with Dr. Schmied. Basic idea: actually not that shocking (no offense). Alter DNA: Impressive. Order chunks of revised DNA from synthesizer: impressive budget. Stitch together into functioning organism without developing a whole new technology: Wow.
There is really interesting and readable blog entry ""Things You Should Never Do, Part I"", April 6, 2000 by Joel Spolsky, for CEO now Chairman of Stack Overflow. It analyzes the costly mistake Netscape made in rewriting from scratch and losing market share while time flew by.   That could well apply to bug design as well. Those old bugs with with the redundant code? That redundancy could serve some purpose, cover some failure mode that is not currently understood. Trying to rewrite the bugs from scratch could have introduced new bugs into the new bugs and buggy bugs could be the result. Comparative survivability testing in stressful environments (bugs for lunch?) is on order.
I don't really find it surprising that DNA manipulation of this magnitude could be done easily. It sort of stands to reason that nature does it all on its own, albeit on a much smaller scale over time. On a microscopic scale, it pretty much has to be ""easy"" in order to evolve a species on a macroscopic level. I liken it to a Lego's set. Each piece is a non-unique individual, and can have many of the same kind of piece showing up in a work. But they only fit together in certain ways in order to create a specific organism. Even then, there are variations in the organisms depending on the complexity of the organism, and the number of pieces it takes to get it to build into that organism. Extra pieces would likely play a role in the viability of the thing. It's one thing to build something. It's another to keep it maintained, which seems to be the case in this experiment in that the extra pieces might have had to do with facilitating growth. So when ""building"" with these Lego's, it's not just the structure, but the function as well that's being built. We each carry around a lot of extra genes that don't express in us, but might when put together with other genes. E. coli reproduces itself, so it doesn't combine with outside genes, which makes this kind of experiment possible (even if on a ridiculously expensive level). It's a relatively simple bacteria in structure and relatively simple in function. So I'd expect DNA to be rather easy to manipulate. What it does to an organism, however, may not be so simple to predict. And removing extra ""pieces"" may well end up being catastrophic to the organism. I'm fairly certain, based on the law of averages, that catastrophic DNA alignments happen all the time, and result in non-viable organisms. Only that's done by nature, not man. At least, so far. I can see a good sci-fi story from this, but I wouldn't want to live it. I only hope researchers are prudent in what they develop. Given human nature, that's not necessarily a given. But given the apparent expense and difficulty in doing this in a way that produces a viable organism (if not necessarily one that thrives as well), it's unlikely to be a sci-fi horror story for mankind anytime soon. As long as evil genius billionaires don't get involved, it'll take a while before we start creating the perfect human beings.
Perhaps only two bases would not do because they would offer too many (or not enough) handholds for epigenetic modifications. Another cause I can think of is that two bases make only one base pair; having either AT or GC would make DNA duplexes either too unstable or too stable for enzymes to work with. Interestingly, the human genome contains fewer CG repeats than could be expected from random chance. Regarding the 'why only 20 out of 64' question referred to in the article: I favour the explanation that anticodon selectivity plays the most important role. You need good selectivity (meaning higher affinity over mismatches) to reduce error rate. Apparently, only 20-22 out of 64 possible codons are sufficiently different from each other. Last edited by jade1234 on Wed May 15, 2019 7:50 pm
The lower growth rate could just be an effect of the increased demand for the the tRNA that matches the codon the used to replace the ones they edited out. It would be interesting to see if growth rate is restored if the re-introduce the variants of the removed tRNAs that match the replacement codon.
Who needs redundancy, anyway? I mean why go through the trouble of checking both angle-of-attack sensor readings when one is all you need?
In a sense, asking whether redundancy is ""useful"" is beside the point. It's inevitable. There's no way to avoid it. With 64 possible combinations that get mapped to 21 possible results, you get a lot of redundant mappings. You can carefully engineer a genome where some of those 64 combinations never appear, but as soon as the cell starts reproducing you'll get mutations. That will make them appear again, and the cell will need to interpret them in some way. If you delete the corresponding tRNA so the cell can't map it to any amino acid, then by default it becomes a stop codon. Having 44 different stop codons would be really bad for the species. Over 2/3 of all mutations would produce a stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated. Mutations like that are much more likely to destroy its function than ones that just change the type of a single amino acid. So mutations would become much more likely to be fatal, which would make it much harder for the cell to evolve. Of course, that could be a useful thing if you've created an engineered organism, and you specifically want to prevent it from evolving. Less likely to get out of control if it escapes from your lab.
I think that the obvious thing to do is to let this run through a few hundred generations, and then try to reduce another set of the redundant codons, and see if one can end up with say 10 unused triplets. Meanwhile, one will start to engineer tRNAs, and their loading proteins to incorporate new amino acids, which may not be totally artificial, but say including some of the normal postranslational modifications, such as hydroxyproline, selenocysteine and pyrrolyllysine. This might allow us to manufacture medicinally important proteins with the desired modifications already built in. For more blue sky stuff one would go to incorporating entirely unnatural amino acids, also aiming eventually at medicinal proteins, or perhaps tougher silks, better enzymes for artificial photosynthesis, etc., etc..

Soo WinZip/WinRAR eColi? Very interesting concept indeed. Makes sense. Curious to see what other realms this carries us into!
Since you're all here perhaps someone can explain to me why arginine (which is one of the less abundant residues within proteins) has 6 codons. Did the evolution of biochemistry from chemistry back in the day favour strongly basic amino acids?
Once again, Scandinavia has the answers. Look at how they treat their criminals as a model for how we should treat ours.

It's a much better use of funds to put buying power into the hands of many, rather than for the few to hoard in offshore accounts tax free. The smartest people in the room realize UBI is coming, may as well do it proactively rather than reactively and minimize transitionary hiccups. So go ahead, downvote me in your daze of myopia. In Iraq we paid locals in cash to not shoot at us. This is similar. It's gross but it works. UBI is the solution to disparity, which causes most crime.

I recommend reading ""NewJack"" , https://www.amazon.com/Newjack-Guarding ... 375726624/ , for a view into one of the more benign prison settings and how even that ruins prisoners' psyches. Ditto ""Orange is the new Black,"" the book and not the tv series.
It's a sociological problem, essentially the sort of people that end up in prison for violent crime, if they weren't already socially disenfranchised prior to that, definitely are once they've been to prison. The problem with incarceration in the USA is it's not a means to any solution, it's simply an end to mollify the masses, who don't care about solutions and only want to have their intense anger vindicated. To put it another way, our justice system isn't designed to benefit anyone that needs it to be beneficial, it's to benefit those that demogogue and those driven by animus.
Prisons are for-profit institutions. Less prisoners means less profit. The capitalist motivation in that circumstance is to encourage repeat offenders.
Yeah but who will replace all that prison slavery i mean labor?
I find it increasingly telling that many of the worst issues arise from local governments using fines for revenue generation. When you basically hammer the poor with unrealistic fines for minor infractions, and punish the fact that they can't pay it with jail time, it's clear that the use of prison is not about ""rehabilitation"".
You forgot pseudo-slave labor pool and captive market that can be exploited and milked for as much as possible with no repercussions. These are arguably the most important roles as far as government and prison industry is concerned.
It's not uncommon to read a biography of some successful person from a hundred or two hundred years ago and find that they really fucked up early in life and had to go reinvent themselves elsewhere. That's a thing you could do back then: escape your own past. Information just wasn't disseminated so broadly and effortlessly. Now your past mistakes live with you forever, no matter how far you try to run from them. I think this is a bug, not a feature, but I have no ideas for how to improve it short of actually policing what information can be retained by third parties, an idea I consider a morally abhorrent non-starter.
Point of clarification: in the opening paragraph, you list ""a deterrent to future crimes, and an opportunity for rehabilitation"" as reasons for prison. What is the distinction between these two meant to be? If you're rehabilitating someone, doesn't that deter them from future crimes pretty much by definition? I ask partly because when I see the term ""deterrent""in this context, I tend to think mechanisms that dissuade someone from committing a crime initially. It appears that the rest of the article uses the term to mean something more like recidivism.

""Obviously true"" conclusions to complex, multivariate questions are the conclusions which are most in need of sober, rational study.
If death penalty was an actual deterrent, a state like Texas should have a murder rate way lower then states without capital punishment. Unfortunately the facts prove otherwise.
If being tough on crime worked, my home state of Texas would have absurdly low crime due to its liberal usage of the death penalty. Crime still occurs there, shockingly enough. Also shockingly enough, treating prisoners like human beings and not like animals results in them acting better. Too bad so many of my fellow Americans believe in the just world fallacy and a spiteful and vengeful take on punishment. Last edited by Deputy Cartman on Tue May 14, 2019 3:13 pm
There's a big difference in not doing something because you think it's wrong (rehabilitation), and not doing something because you're scared of the consequences (deterrent). The result may be similar, but differ in cost and duration of effectiveness. There are also ethical concerns with deterrence. It's the difference between Singapore and Sweden. They both have low crime rates, but I'd rather live someplace where they don't beat people for littering, regardless of how effective a deterrent it may be.
I do think it's extremely misleading to call this ""deterrence"", even if the paper does. Deterrence is almost always used in the context of punishments harsh enough to prevent people from committing crimes initially, where as this is talking about recidivism. As far as I'm aware there's still no evidence that deterrence is an effective strategy at all.
I think the Scandinavian model is worth a great deal more consideration than it receives in the United States, but it is tempting to over-interpret or over-weight their results. Those societies are comparatively homogeneous and lack some of the interesting and complicating features of many other societies. For the sake of argument, let's assume that black people in the United States continue to fight lingering after-effects of their second-class status from the days of slavery and then Jim Crow, and that this has a major effect on their interaction with the modern criminal justice system (I think this not an outlandish hypothesis!). Applying the Scandanavian criminal justice model would be operating, if you will, out of sample. That system has never been tested in a highly heterogeneous society, and we should be careful before we declare it would be successful. It might work better in the US than the current US system. I think it probably would. But I wouldn't say so conclusively. You see the same thing with Japan, another highly-developed nearly-monocultural society.

You understand with the exception of murder* that per capita crime has been on a major rise since 2000 Scandinavia: Sweden - Since 2004 per capita rape has more than doubled. Murder is still historically low, but up 30-40% since 2000. Oslo, Norway - 7x the per capita theft of Berlin, massive crime increase since ~2000. Recently listed as unsafe for female tourists by Dumont travel guide. Though it is well documented that a large portion of Norwegian crime is committed by foreigners**. Denmark - Crime rates more like Germany (logically) and like Norway, criminality is more common among foreigners. Obviously I am cherry picking statistics, but there isn't evidence that Scandinavia has some magic formula as much as they have a different culture. *The Scandinavians simply value life a lot more than the poor and disenfranchised in the US. The same comparison holds when you isolate by income levels and observe same race murder by race -- certain races clearly have a less defined value for life at the same poverty levels. **Because as no one wants to accept it but, the native Scandinavians are monoculture by US standards with vastly less diversity than the US. Probably less diversity of culture and thought than the state of Maine. traumadog wrote: mikesmith wrote: It's a sociological problem, essentially the sort of people that end up in prison for violent crime, if they weren't already socially disenfranchised prior to that, definitely are once they've been to prison.

In Texas, especially DFW where several suburbs have monetized the roadways beyond just toll roads, I am a huge advocate for a Robin Hood style approach to municipal fines. Otherwise it is just taxation without representation if you live in another suburb and cross one of the ones with 5-20x the normal per-capita traffic fine frequency.

Japan has an over 99% conviction rate, that should give anyone pause. Japan is neat in a lot of ways, but there is some incredible fundamental problems from women's status, to working culture, I'm in no real hurry to adopt things from Japan without a lot of consideration.
Well not in federal prison but then again it's a small slice of the prison population.
Source, thankyou. ""The rate of exposure to sexual offences has remained relatively unchanged, according to the SCS, since the first survey was conducted in 2006, despite an increase in the number of reported sex crimes.[65] This discrepancy can largely be explained by reforms in sex crime legislation, widening of the definition of rape,[66][67][68] and an effort by the Government to decrease the number of unreported cases.[67][69][70][71]"" The doubling of rapes and the high instance is a myth, which comes from not understanding how the statistics are collected, what is reported etc. ""Widening the definition of rape"" is also the explanation why Assange is wanted here.
Your 'stopgap' is exactly the status quo, which has been NOT working for over a century.
One of the things that’s really troubling about the isolation justification for criminal justice is that it works regardless of whether the people in prison committed a crime in the first place, let alone a crime worthy of incarceration. 9% of all young black men are incarcerated. Decimating a population of young men, particularly socially disadvantaged young men, will, through the cold work of statistics prevent some crimes from being committed. But it’s terrifying how easy it is to get the cause and effect backwards here. If the criminal justice system “works” through isolating “criminals,” then putting “them” in camps works too.
Kind of missed a point in how much its a deterrent for people to not commit crimes, not sure how you'd measure that though.
End for profit prison industry and end the war on drugs. Both affect the poor and minorities disproportionately with no positive effects on society.
Rick Sanchez C-137 is the last person I'd listen to when trying to fix social problems...
+1 / Agree. While there is a component to crime of moral failing, what I think we often miss is that most petty crime has its roots in economic problems. By treating your fellow human more humanely - UBI - I think it's possible to reduce crime down hugely. So, yes, by paying more in taxes to give everyone a base level of pay, it's possible for our society as a whole to ultimately pay less in a number of fields, and in so doing, profit.
And don't forget District Attorneys who use these easy targets as a means to build a public profile so they can go further into their politicalc careers.
The lingo in criminal justice circles is specific deterrence and general deterrence. Specific deterrence is the “I’m not going back to prison variety.” General deterrence is society signaling to people that *blank* is a serious crime. General deterrence is the, “I better not sell loose cigarettes, or I might be executed variety.”
Prison--aka higher education for criminals--is not a deterrent. It's more like an all expenses paid vacation. And, frankly, there's little difference these days between the people who get sent to prison and the ones sending them there. The majority of convicts don't belong in prison to begin with. Our legal system is based more on job security for so-called law enforcement personnel. The single biggest problem is that punishment does not fit the crime. As such, it's all just a never-ending vicious cycle.
We’ve known for some time that deterrence doesn’t work particularly well. Deterrence theory has been borrowed by other disciplines too, including Information Systems, where for example, it’s used to predict effectiveness of security policies. Much more effective is measuring social acceptance and likelihood of rationalizing behavior. While these are better than deterrence, there still isn’t a great solution for predicting incidence of violation (and thus preventing it).

So what are all the event species? Just BH - BH, BH - N, and N - N? Can we detect a star going in? Or does a star get spaghettified etc. because it is not dense enough to survive the approach?
I would imagine that spaghettification happens regardless, but perhaps to a lesser extant or differently than if they collide at high speeds directly instead of twirling around it, and falling in a decayed orbit
""A few years of this and we'll understand the afterlife of dead stars."" - from the article headline. A few years of this and we'll have more questions than answers like in most fields of scientific endeavor. That's generally how things work.
The frontier of knowledge is like the inside of a sphere. As we expand our understanding the sphere gets larger.
Yep, the universe guards her secrets and only rewards your probing with new questions...
It is really amazing to have watched gravitational wave astronomy go from a complete novelty to almost routine science in such a short period.
If there was a direct impact between a star and another large object, it would probably make some big waves, but space is so big that I don't think that ever really happens. Neutron stars and black holes make waves because they're so dense that it's not possible for another object to slowly siphon off any material from them, so they end up orbiting very close to each other while still intact. Stars would just slowly bleed off material to the other object from a much greater distance until either the star is gone or some kind of supernova event happens
I would love to see a N getting destroyed by a BH. I bet there's all kinds of data that can be gleaned from that.
I know it's confirmation bias to say that blackhole mergers are ""common"" given that it's about the only type of gravitational event whose waves are powerful enough for us to detect-- still it makes me a little uneasy that our universe is already in the ""blackholes eating each other"" phase. That's how the universe ends given our current grasp of physics, is it not? Edit- I know we'll all be long gone by then. Last edited by gandalfSVG on Thu May 02, 2019 3:55 pm
And that is freaking AWESOME! I mean, science's triumph over superstition is being able to admit ignorance.
I believe the current theory is the universe ends when Galactus has devoured all available energy, which is then released into a new universe when he explodes into the next big bang.
LIGO publishes its candidate detections publicly via grace db. The most interesting result is still most likely a pair of neutron stars merging. The only thing LIGO is currently certain is that it was not a pair of conventional (5+ solar masses) black holes: 49% Binary Neutron Star 24% Massgap 14% Terrestrial (false positive) 13% Neutron Star + Black hole 0% Binary black hole Last edited by DanNeely on Thu May 02, 2019 12:27 pm
After the merger with the neutron star, did the black hole said ""burp"" ?:) Last edited by academic.sam on Thu May 02, 2019 12:26 pm
What does Massgap refer to here? I'm aware of the definition from QFT, but it's not really clear to me what that would imply here.
Yes the sphere gets bigger, and the densest, heavier materials fall to the center. That is why flat earthers, anti vaxer's, and other conspiracy idiots all gather together.
Lots of science is mind-blowing, but the fact that we can measure changes in the very fabric of space and time as these waves pass us blows my mind the most.
It was mentioned in the article. The heaviest known NS we've seen is 2 solar masses, the lightest black hole is 5 solar masses. Anything between those two values would be a mass gap object which we can't be certain (from its mass) what it was.
So.... it's the internet?
I need more coffee before posting.
Lets not get into another species designation war.
(Caveat: not an astrophysicist.) For supermassive black holes, tidal forces are low enough that spaghettification is not a thing, but an infalling star would probably be ripped to shreds in the ergosphere and accretion disk anyways by gas and dust. Stellar mass black holes would spaghettify matter, but they're going to be fed by streams of matter first (see below). Stars would also stream any matter that was outside of their Roche lobes even before they physically come into contact with the accretion disk, making the disk even larger and denser. Stars are unlikely to be swallowed whole in one gulp, but the size and composition of the stellar remnant that ends up getting swallowed by the event horizon probably depends a lot on relative masses, velocities and local conditions.
Even so, I'm not sure it's on a timescale humanity needs to worry about.
As you suspect, a star is just too soft. What we see in a BH/BH/N/N merger are first the gravitational waves emitted by two massive bodies rapidly circling each other. In Newtonian physics they'd just orbit each other eternally, but in Einsteinian physics they distort space and lose energy in the form of gravitational waves - the lost energy means they spiral in towards each other, moving faster and now closer, which means they radiate stronger and stronger gravity waves until they merge. At the last moments, there is a little bit of stringification if you have a large BH and a small BH (say 60 and 5 solar masses). Simulations show the small BH can get warped into about a 180 degree arc around the big one just before contact, but by then there's been a lot of emission. At that point they merge and what we see is the 'ringdown'. The merged black hole rings like a bell till it (rapidly) becomes spherical again. That ringing also generates gravitational waves. In total about 5-10% of the mass is converted to energy in this process. That's a hell of a lot of mass for a black hole! In the case of a black hole eating a star, it starts stripping it before it even gets very close. They don't start rotating rapidly around each other - rather, the star gets converted into a very fast moving stream of gas around the black hole. Most importantly, the black hole fails to be jerked around significantly, so no strong waves are created. There are gravitational waves created, but far too weak for us to see unless we had a sensitive detector near the hole.
A substance so dense and heavy that not even light can escape its pull, a teaspoon weighting trillions of tons, and it gets stretched and pulled into a thousands mile long string. That’s my mind boggled for the day. Thanks very much.
When these events have some probability of a terrestrial origin, does that tend to just mean vibrations, seismic activity, etc? Or does it actually mean gravitational waves from events on Earth? How does the intensity of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger 10^21 miles away compare to what you would get from a couple of small masses in a centrifuge one mile away?
True, but at least by then we'll have some answers instead of pretty much only asking questions, like we are at this stage.
The former.
""The consensus seems to be that, over time, gravitational wave science will shift toward a focus on events that are either very rare—and simple mergers won't be among those"" Something more for the 'meh' pile? Orbital boosters landing and being reused - meh. Electric cars outperforming ICE - meh. High speed internet direct to your home, or out on the go - meh. Star-trek-style tricorders, except far more fully featured - meh. What a time to live and be completely underwhelmed, living in a world of what used to be fanciful science fiction. At least black hole images are going to take a little while to join the heap.
You are right. This process is now common in science. A new technique provides a single case. The technique gets applied and, simultaneously, improved until there are a few more cases. Then so many cases are reported that they are not worth noting until someone either finds an exception to the events seen before or can pull a new concept out of the data. I first experienced this phenomenon working in a laboratory that isolated a few cold sensitive mutants for Escherichia coli DNA synthesis. My task was developing a faster, easier method to find cold sensitive mutants. The idea was that, once enough mutants for each location of DNA synthesis had been found by this technique, based on Poisson statistics, now new ones were likely to be found except by a different methods. Once the method was developed, a graduate student was asked to create a big group of cold sensitive mutants using this method and then look for many more DNA mutants in the group. At fist, the student was reluctant, wanting to get his research done really fast. I and another post doctoral fellow, doing the genetics on such mutants, told the student that this was actually going to go really fast. Within 2 years, the student had isolated and mapped over 100 such mutants, got his degree, and was on to a bright future. The most recent example is whole genome sequencing. The time and cost for the complete sequencing of human genomes has been reduced from years and maybe $100 million each (after initial costs for the method) to weeks or days and $1000 to $2000 each: https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/f ... enome-cost. The result is a focus on statistical and functional analysis of the components of genomes. We do live in interesting times, but in a nice way.
Put it this way, at one point they detected birds chipping ice off some cooling pipes next to the detector.
A Swarzschild black hole with a mass of 60 solar masses has an event horizon radius of only about 110 miles.
I'm not going to do the math for these specific examples, but as an example the famous GW150914 merger had a merger of two ~30 solar mass black holes 1.34E9 light years away. The signal for that was a change in the length of one LIGO arm relative to the other ('Strain') of 1E-21 at peak intensity. The only way this works at all is by having multiple detectors (the more the better) and only considering signals that show up at the same time (adjusting for speed of light) in all detectors after they filter out all known local sources of noise. And they're only looking for patterns that look something like the chirp + ringdown we see in mergers - so we may be missing interesting things just because we don't know what they look like but we can afford to miss them for now. So this is where the terrestrial origin signals show up. Turns out an earthquake can easily register on all detectors worldwide (even seismographs can pick up large ones on the other side of the Earth) - depending on where the epicenter is one can show up at a couple of them near simultaneously, and it the increasing undulations can look like a chirp. Later on it's pretty easy to correlate that with known earthquakes and check that the signals don't make sense for a merger, and go 'sorry!' FWIW I think your small masses a mile away would be an even smaller signal than GW150914. Gravity is weak as hell compared to other forces (put your hand on top of your head - you just beat gravity), so we only see these mergers because they're so insane. The false positives aren't measuring gravity waves, they're measuring vibrations.
The masses involved are insane, but so are the distances. If the amplitude of the wave falls off with the square of distance, then the event a billion light years away (around 10^21 miles) would be a factor of 10^42 weaker than if it was just 1 mile away. Then if the amplitude of the waves scales linearly with the mass involved, you would need only need a mass that's a factor of 10^42 smaller than the black holes. 60 solar masses is in the neighborhood of 10^32 kg, so you should only need.. less than a microgram of mass doing a similar dance to recreate the same amplitude of wave. That doesn't sound right at all though. What did I get wrong? edit: I suppose the key is density. No earthly material is dense enough for two pieces to get close enough to actually produce the same type of interaction
That is the essence of science. Questions lead to answers which in turn lead to more questions and so on. In science, it's the journey not the destination.
Yes, good question. The other thing you're missing is the speeds. Those black holes are not only insanely massive, they're moving at over half the speed of light when they merge, and it's masses moving through space that causes gravity waves. It's only in the last fraction of a second of the merger that they're even going fast enough that we can barely detect it. And of course your two low mass items in a centrifuge are never going to approach light speed. Multiply that by the low masses (small gravity wells) and it's two gnats farting in an F5 tornado.
I am waiting for Nibblonian poop meets BH.
Oh sorry dude, did not know you were a survivor of the dwarf planet designation war of August 2006. I should learn not to run my mouth like that.
Gravitational waves (as opposed to static gravity) fall off at 1/r, not 1/r^2. This is kinda technical but, see, e.g.: http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave.html
We had a magma ocean? Huh.
That time course illustration is fascinating (and terrifying). Is there a more granular version, or, dare I hope, an animation?
No problem. We had niobium boats with tungsten props.
There is no ""typically"" to it... Science is devise hypothesis, test, observe, record data, discard what fails, adjust hypothesis, repeat - for as long as it takes. Somewhere along the way, discoveries and insights are made that advances human knowledge and technology.
So this is slightly different from the theory that came out recently, that the collision created a synestia...basically, both the protoEarth and the impactor were vaporized and then cooled and coalesced into the Earth and Moon we have today. Either way, it would have been an awesome show. Just another reason to get better looks at solar systems that are currently forming!
Wait, I didn't realize that the Earth/Moon setup was unique. Huh, I wonder how different a planet would be without a large moon creating tides like we have come to expect as normal.
What a fun simulation model to work with. Instead of simulating traffic flow and traffic light behavior during rush hour, or climate/pollution models, this is a planetary collision involving literally astronomical kinetic energy. It's helpful that the end result-- the actual Earth-Luna system-- is so well constrained; you know the total mass of the two bodies, you know the angular momentum, etc. I wonder what the phase phase of related variables like impactor mass and angle of incidence of the collision look like.
Columbium, and get off my glowing lawn, whippersnapper!
There are some theories that say life would not be possible without the ocean tides raised by the Moon, but I am somewhat skeptical of that, as that would mean that life on most of the exoplanets we have found would be unlikely.
I think history shows that advances in Science depend more on Technology than vice versa. Galileo's telescope surely advanced science, but telescope making depended on the ability make clear glass, and the ability to grind that glass. John Dalton's Atomic Theory depended on his ability to weigh stuff accurately. His balance relied on the ability of people to make clocks and other fine instruments using beautifully machined metal. Thermodynamics owes more to the manufacturers of steam engines than the other way round. and so on
What an amazing sight it would've been. The biggest splash in Earth's history. edit: Speeling. Last edited by Cervus on Tue Apr 30, 2019 1:34 pm
So..where did that mass come from? The trajectory...the orbit plane... seems really amazing.
It does provide a pretty neat solution to the Drake equation, though. I.e., f sub l is vanishingly small.
""Aliens"". More seriously, it must have formed in the vicinity of Earth's orbit, before Earth was old/big enough to have cleared its orbit.
As best we can tell, when a protostar forms into a single star, most of the leftovers remain aligned in an orbital plane containing the equator of the newly formed star. It's reasonable to assume that the Lunar impactor got nudged into a collision by Jupiter's influence. You could make some reasonable generalizations about orbital velocities and angles from Earth-crossing asteroids which have had the same thing happen to them.
The Late Heavy Bombardment makes the Armageddon scenario look like child's play.
Saturn was popular I guess.
I thought it was generally accepted that the impact occurred while the Earth was still fairly gooey, which explained why a substantial amount of the lighter non-metallic mass got knocked into space. It's interesting looking into the history of this research though and see how astronomers eventually figured out where the Moon came from. Laser measurements detected that the distance of the Moon is increasing in tiny increments, and someone decided to model that shift and then run it backwards.
I've nothing but admiration for modeling like this. Orbital dynamics is already a bitch; to add things like impact obliqueness, density boundaries and play around with the depth of magma oceans... /goes back to doing very non-abstract and easy-to-understand things to cool off brain.
A very nice study with some interesting results. If their work holds up, then it adds a much tighter constraint on when the Moon formed as well as how.
While there is reason to believe a moon like ours isn't necessary for life, your particular stated reason for skepticism doesn't make logical sense. One can't currently work backward from the exoplanets we've detected to argue against moon necessity, as we haven't identified life-bearing moonless exoplanets that would falsify the hypothesis. (So far, we've neither discovered biosignatures on any of the detected exoplanets nor, to my knowledge, ruled out exomoons circling any of the exoplanets far enough from their stars to have stably orbiting moons.) (As a side note, life As We Know ItTM is unlikely-to-impossible on the vast majority of the exoplanets we've detected so far, anyway, due to detection bias towards giants and planets very close to their stars.)
Those would be great for running the lava rapids on Kona....
I think a stronger argument can be made that without the tides there would have been less movement of life from the oceans to the land. Tide plains are a perfect environment for water organisms to evolve and adapt to land.
They would be smaller but we'd still have solar tides. They're about half as high as todays lunar tides (or 1/3rd as high as when solar + lunar tides are in phase).
I always wondered why the isotopic similarity between Earth and Moon was even considered a mystery in the first place. Chances are the Earth and Theia had both formed in the same region of the solar system, from the same population of planetesimals. There would have been many similar collisions during the time leading up to proto-Earth/Theia, which might have simply been the last of the really big ones.
Until we have the ability to detect exomoons, we won't have a real grasp on whether the Earth-Moon system is truly unusual or not. Sure, we don't have anything exactly like it in our solar system, but then again, we don't have any hot Jupiters, mini-Neptunes or superEarths, and we have found plenty of them elsewhere. I wouldn't be surprised to find Earth-Moon isn't terribly unique once we have the tech to find analogs in other solar systems.
The Sun creates tides too, so there's that. More significantly, having a massive moon helps stabilize a planet's rotation so the inclination of its rotational axis doesn't go wonky, as Mars's is believed to. Massive changes in inclination are not good for a planet's climate, nor its biosphere. (For what it's worth, all the terraformed planets in my T-Space novels have large moons. Whoever terraformed them had scary technology available.)
One theory (based in part on the near identical isotope ratios) was that it formed at the Sun-Earth L4 or L5 points, then (due to perturbation by Jupiter, etc) drifted forward (or backward) in the orbit until ... splash! That takes care of the orbital plane issue.
Large moons aren't that unusual in the solar system. Earth has one. Pluto has one. It's likely that Mars used to have one, with Phobos and Deimos being tiny pieces of its last remnants after it got disrupted into rings due to orbiting too close. On the other hand, Venus never had one.
The Early Heavy Bombardment (ie, original planetary formation) even more so.
If I had a time machine, or even just a window, two of the things I most want to see (safely) would be Hadean Era Earth, and the Theia impact. Oh, and Chixhulub. But again, safely.

Rather, it is the fact that the Moon is so proportionally large compared to the planet it orbits. No other planet in our solar system has such a proportionally large moon.
We got a moon because the floor was lava!

I stand corrected. Thanks DanNeely!

If was an ocean, and therefore on the surface, wouldn’t that make it lava rather than magma?
The out that geologists use for this is that lava is erupted magma. Since this wasn't erupted, it can't be lava. The truth is we just think that magma ocean sounds cooler...
As a Canadian, I already knew this.
I find it a little unfair to divide the countries like they did. If you are going to divide the United Kingdom into England and Scotland, why not divide the US into states and Canada into provinces? Five million people live in Scotland. Over three hundred million live in the US. Maybe they bullshit less in the Midwest compared to California or New England? Or maybe it's the other way around. Would have been nice to know, I guess. And I'm Danish. I gather only English speaking countries were surveyed. So are québeqois included in this survey for Canadians?

Do you understand declarative fractions? I half do. Do you understand subjunctive scaling? I might.
As a fellow Canadian I clearly know everything!
From my experience, guys from Queens are the worse.
Scotland and England are countries. If you divide the US and Canada into provinces then you need to break down England and Scotland into their equivalent counties. I want to see Angus and Aberdeenshire represented.
Quote: Researchers trace BS back to an obscure 1986 essay by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, Obscure? I've been recommending people read it for ages! It's well worth a look. Quote: Her statement is grounded neither in a belief that it is true nor, as a lie must be, in a belief that it is not true. It is just this lack of connection to a concern with truth — this indifference to how things really are — that I regard as of the essence of bullshit. ... Telling a lie is an act with a sharp focus. It is designed to insert a particular falsehood at a specific point in a set or system of beliefs, in order to avoid the consequences of having that point occupied by the truth. This requires a degree of craftsmanship, in which the teller of the lie submits to objective constraints imposed by what he takes to be the truth. The liar is inescapably concerned with truth-values. In order to invent a lie at all, he must think he knows what is true. And in order to invent an effective lie, he must design his falsehood under the guidance of that truth. On the other hand, a person who undertakes to bullshit his way through has much more freedom. His focus is panoramic rather than particular. He does not limit himself to inserting a certain falsehood at a specific point, and thus he is not constrained by the truths surrounding that point or intersecting it. He is prepared to fake the context as well, so far as need requires. Here's a link: http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/f ... llshit.pdf
Sorry.
No need to gather; it’s stated in the article that they focused on English speakers to clearly state the bullshit and minimize confusion with real mathematical concepts. But because immigrants were also included, presumably anyone who spoke English proficiently in those countries were permitted to participate. The Quebecois were probably sampled, but of course that’s just an inference made by me. Last edited by The White Tiger on Sun Apr 28, 2019 9:26 am
The question I have is, how many of the respondents believe they likely would understand the concepts even though they are not familiar with the specific term? That would be more of a (delusional) self confidence indicator than a BS indicator. Last edited by ThinkingMore on Sun Apr 28, 2019 9:27 am

Children (and many adults) need to learn that being wrong is okay... and not knowing everything is okay. Your ego can take a few hits every now and then and use being wrong as a learning experience. Fake confidence hiding a fragile ego is an epidemic in most of the world.
The ""proper number"" one might have confused me if I were a test taker at that age, because proper fractions and proper form are common math concepts, and the phrase is also applied when talking about significant digits. The other two terms are more usable for testing because they're completely made up.
Well, I'd say the correlation there is a bit more than ""tempting"". In tech business especially, bullshit and hype, aka vaporware, is king. 5G anyone? How many times has the marketing folks sold a product that you, as an engineer, didn't even know your company offered? And how else did Theranos become a multi-billion thing? Fake it till you make it -if you are lucky. Or till you go burst, if you are unlucky.

How sure are they that the people who said they were familiar with these concepts weren't just assuming that the question was poorly worded? God knows I've seen enough surveys and questionnaires where, going by the wording used, the question that was actually asked was not quite the same question they meant to ask, but it's usually possible to figure out what's really being asked. If I were asked how familiar I was with ""proper numbers"" on a survey like this, if I knew that there was no such thing I'd probably assume they meant rational numbers or something, and answer yes, I am familiar with the concept I *think* you're asking me about.
Over the past few decades many of the provinces in Canada (education is a provincial responsibility) brought in the latest and most fashionable so-called innovations in teaching math under the umbrella new math. Part of it was buying kool-aid from high priced educational advisers and part of it was to make math more subjective and talky to appeal to girls and reduce grade disparity. Many of the traditional ways of understanding and describing various century old methods were changed, renamed and retreaded. Younger people going through the system were being taught math in ways that were opaque and bizarre to their parents. Huge numbers turned to tutors and even private schools that used traditional methods in utter frustration. The mix of new and old led to even more confusion. I suspect the study is not uncovering intentional prevarication among Canadians but reflecting the mass confusion and disruption in the names and methods in math education in the country over the past few decades.
True. Fear of failure occupies a significant portion of my student's minds; so much so that they will frequently choose inaction over being incorrect. I usually take this opportunity to introduce them to some sci-fi literature and quote the Bene Gesserit litany against fear.
""Fake it 'til you make it"" is the motto we all learned. Bullshitting is a required skill.
""Most of us have come across an individual so skilled in deploying it to advance their goals that we refer to them as ""bullshit artists."" Sometimes we elect them to high office.
I'd question how much of this is intentional, in the US, versus reflexive. Kids are taught so many topics in ways that lead to almost no retention (particularly of topic naming), yet are expected to never show ""weakness"" for anything related to college entrance that they're left unsure of what they know, particularly by given names of topics in fields like math. ""That sounds like something I think I probably know"" or even ""I bet they meant this thing I learned under this other name, I bet those are actually the same"" is very much something they've been trained (conditioned, even) to automatically give a ""yes I know that"" response to. They've also been taught that it's easier to ask forgiveness, that it's easy to claim a mistake once your foot is in the door but the alternative is that no one will even bother with you if you fall below the threshold, so if there's a chance you might know something because it has a ""ring of familiarity"" then claim you do and hopefully if it comes up it will be in a better context to prompt actual recall. And they've learned that nine times out of ten no one is actually paying attention to them in a positive attention sense, but rather just screening them out by rote, so if it turns out to be something they didn't know it's unlikely to be noticed ever. I'm just concerned that by placing their questions in something with a very similar format to the types of exams and questionnaires broadly associated with College entrance at this age, that they may have unwittingly tainted their results by failing to account for domain specific nuance and modality. Using math topic names that have a ""ring of truth"" sound to them would only compound this. Particularly in picking ones that could be considered to vaguely sound relatively simple and likely to fall within the topical domains most of these students have been learning. I'll have to read the paper to see if they better explain their rationale in what they used, but it's odd to me that there's not a clear ""over advanced"" outlier inserted, such as ""matrix integrated differential calculus"". Or even something that's a randomly named theorem, with no shared words with anything they might have been exposed to. Not that what's being measured isn't still bullshit, but it might be a different sort than more generalized bullshit. Note that this would also be different, by degrees, from Dunning-Kruger effects. I'm also concerned as to whether the format used for asking this actually pulled in the student's claimed confidence in their knowledge, which would be useful, particularly when set against non bullshit topics they presumably probably do actually know. I'd also be curious how well their self rating on other topics actually matched their performance, particularly on any topics that might seem ""close"" in some way to the bullshit ones in terms of naming (such as rational numbers or even simply integers/""whole numbers""/""natural numbers""[!!??] vs ""proper numbers"").
What about ""subjunctive scaling"" and ""declarative fraction""? And would teenagers really know there was no such thing? How could they be certain? On the other hand, the main correlation found is with overconfidence in their own ability so I suppose they could just be assuming they knew everything.
Only if you look at the mean bullshitting score. The median filters out that extreme outlier.
The problem is that instead of measuring bullshit when using this format, you may be measuring trust in authority instead. Each of the bullshit answers compositionally use one word that's a real topic they presumably would have actually studied. Numbers. Scaling. Fractions. None of these are advanced. None of them, even when combined, sound advanced. And Math is littered, during school, with weird highly arbitrary nomenclature, some of which is actually made up specifically for labeling topics within school even when there is already a common accepted label in the field. (e.g. whole numbers, counting numbers, natural numbers, probably at least two more I'm not remembering… vs integers… yes we can get into which ones include zero and which include negatives, but that's also part of my point that these are relatively arbitrary and at best only poorly semantic in ways that easily get confused when they're presented together). So if a student trusts that an evaluation instrument wouldn't outright lie to them, then if these ""sound like something I actually know"" they may be more inclined to think it's just a naming disparity.

I don't think the test to distinguish between bullshitting and lying to look good holds much water. Given that the actual attendance could be easily and routinely tested, lying about that would be dangerous. Lying about a specific maths skill is a bit like exaggerating your language skills in a CV. Both are highly unlikely to be put to test if the specific subject is too uncommon to be of much practical use. Also, if you consider yourself good at maths in general, you might well assume you mastered declarative fractions, even if you can't remember exactly how they did work.
here are all of the 'concepts', not sure what percentage of 15 year olds (10th grade) have heard of linear equations or complex numbers the study might have been interesting if they used some general science concepts 1. Exponential function 2. Divisor 3. Quadratic function 4. Proper number 5. Linear equation 6. Vectors 7. Complex number 8. Rational number 9. Radicals 10. Subjunctive scaling 11. Polygon 12. Declarative fraction 13. Congruent figure 14. Cosine 15. Arithmetic mean 16. Probability
As a matter of British law, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are countries. Canadian provinces and US States are not countries according to our legal systems. It looks like the Quebecòis are lumped into the rest of Canada from the PISA website: http://pisadataexplorer.oecd.org/ide/idepisa/ They actually surveyed everyone, but the people who did the study did not put Danish answers in their paper because they figured Danes might say ""I learned Subjunctive something, it must have been Subjunctive Scaling.""
I do recall some of my high school classmates, mainly in non-honors classes, who would refuse to take a quiz they were not prepared for. They would prefer a guaranteed score of zero to an uncertain score that was likely (but not certain) to be low. A strange preference and mathematically insupportable, but it reflects what you're saying.
Except somehow Wales didn't get mentioned?
The difference is which negative outcome offers them a feeling of agency, choice, and control, and which one forces them to (in their minds) humiliate themselves.
The context is also important. Bullshitting on a test comes with little risk and a potential upside. It's a possible strategy to string together some keywords in the hope that the person grading the exam will accept that as an answer and not notice that the sentences themselves make little sense. Doing this with confidence often helps. Maybe with a focus on shallow testing in education and employment it is actually a good strategy to BS. A followup study of the outcome, i.e. if BS artists are more 'successful', would be interesting. My suspicion is, yes, the proportion of BS artists tends to increase toward the top. But the question is, whether BS is more of a cultural identity marker than a useful strategy to get to the top.
Like all studies, this is an interesting data point, but I'd like to see more data. I suspect that more than one person said they knew these concepts because they were not familiar with mathematical terminology, rather than because they were actively bullshitting. My proof is the fact that Canadians and immigrants, came out highest bullshit. Immigrants probably come from a country that does not use English, because only about a third of countries you can come from use English,and just under 25% of Canadians are French-speaking. The canooks are also fairly well-known to have a large immigrant population ( they're 20% foreign born). Does anyone have access to the study data? I clicked through to the link, bt the ables are not avaliable, and it would be fascinating to run their numbers for the countries weighted by immigrant population/percent francophone/etc. just to see what areas should be followed up on. I'm also somewhat surprised that the country that invented ""Blarney"" got a negative bullshit score. Do they have that specific word because they encounter bullshit very rarely and always call it out? Or is this particular measure of bullshit not effective? EDIT: It turns out the tables are at the end, after the citations. The immigration table is particularly fascinating. Natives have negative or zero scores in all countries, but immigrants bring up their averages significantly. This is a fascinating study, but I suspect that what's going on is that immigrants from places like Taiwan got the test, figured ""I don't recognize this, but half the shit I learned was in Chinese, and my mom would kill me if I had not learned it, therefore since I am not dead I must have mastered Subjunctive Scaling,"" and countries like Canada get high scores because they have a lot of those guys running around.

Right, I see that, but for myself personally I think the declaration ""I am a failure and will take a 0 rather than try"" is more humiliating. Different ways of seeing the world. In fairness, I was probably always better prepared, so that also makes a difference.
It did not get mentioned by Ars, but this is the article link. Wales is one of the countries they talk about (it's the 4 UK countries, plus Ireland, the US, Australia, NZ, and Canada, so all white countries). Last edited by NickBII on Sun Apr 28, 2019 10:49 am
Amazing stuff. Thank goodness it wasn't a proton decay.
""1.8 x 10^22 years"" Is this the longest half-life known?
explain like i'm dumb: why liquid xenon for trying to detect dark matter? i'm guessing it has to do with the fact that xenon is a noble gas, but beyond that I have no idea.
Xenon chambers eh? What a noble experiment for such a dark reason *shows self out*
No, Tellurium-128 has a half-life of 2.2x10^24 years.
WHICH uranium isotope? Different isotopes have different decay rates.
When we eventually figure it out I guess we'll finally retire the old image of balls stuck together.
It might just be because I'm baked, but I could not figure out what this title was trying to tell me without reading the article first.
How do you differentiate between a decay of XE to TE from one that goes XE - I - TE in quick succession?
Given it says ""typical"" then I'd guess Uranium-238 seeing as it's by far the most abundant.
In double EC decay the first EC is prohibited by conservation laws (can’t emit a negative energy photon).
The nucleus pretty much only has s electrons to work from, which will leave a vacancy for higher-energy electrons to fall into. I'm guessing they look for x-ray emissions known to occur in Te but not I.
Xenon isn't just a noble element. It's the largest of the noble elements that doesn't generally undergo spontaneous decay (ignoring the incredibly rare events discussed here). The assumed particles they're looking for will interact only through the weak nuclear force so it would have to be a nucleus-to-nucleus interaction. Xenon's got the largest, electrically neutral, stable nucleus we can get. Such an interaction will release a photon so the xenon tanks are surrounded by photodetectors. Edit: Correction: all nucleii are positively-charged. What I meant was an element will full electron orbitals. I think there are nucleus orbitals too that Xenon may have filled.

Now, they need to find a way to capture those handful of tellurium atoms in the xenon bath...
Almost. The release date of Half-Life 3 is slightly longer.
The basic principle of this detector is that when the particle you want to detect goes through your detector's tank, it may interact with the detector material and produce a burst of optical wavelength photons (scintillation light). This flash of light will be then detected by light sensors on the surface of your detectors' tank. For the material inside the tank you want a bunch of properties: - It needs to be dense, to maximize the probability that a particle will actually interact instead of just going through your tank as if it weren't there. Remember they're trying to detect particles which usually go through the entire Earth as if it weren't there. - If and when the particles interact, the scintillation light produced should be as intense and short as possible. - The material should be as transparent to optical wavelengths as possible so that as many optical photons as possible reach the optical detectors. - The material should not as few background events as possible. Liquid Xenon is a good compromise on all of these.

Well, if Asimov was right it will be written eventually - but after the end of the universe... Quote: Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man. All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness. All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected. But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships. A timeless interval was spent in doing that. One presumes that HL3 must be one of those possible infinite combinations of energy, right?
The Last Question, but every instance of 'how do you reverse entropy?' is replaced with 'when will Half-Life 3 come out?'. There is insufficient data for a meaningful answer.

The idea with xeon seems to be isolating it from normal particles - put it fairly deep underground (cut down on cosmic rays?), keep it clean (no radioactivity as mentioned in the article). Then any interactions observed are evidence for dark matter. So... what is an interaction? From the XEON1T Detection Principles page. Quote: Any particle interaction in the liquid xenon (blue) yields two signals: a prompt flash of light, and a delayed charge signal. Together, these two signals give away the energy and position of the interaction as well as the type of the interacting particle. XEON1T detection diagram: The LUX (Large Underground Xeon experiment) writeup at wikipedia describes a similar process and goes into more depth about the analysis. edit: added my handwavey speculation about isolation / evidence for dark matter added link to LUX, also an interesting read.

Interesting that they have a scintillator to create photons from electrons - only to have those photons then be converted back to electrons at a photocathode in the PMT's. It seems you'd have been better off just continuing to cascade the electrons into your drain . Or perhaps it's a dual-purpose detection system. It's capable of detecting photons from any DM-xenon interaction as well as electrons that are freed?
[deleted by user]
This whole article reads like science fiction, but it isn't. The future is pretty friggin rad. Glad we finally got here.
Jefe, would you say I have a plethora of models that describe the behavior of particles inside an atomic nucleus?
If you're smart enough to know there are multiple isotopes of uranium, you're smart enough to know how to Google to find which isotope has a half life around 4 billion years. Or you could make a snarky comment instead.
The interaction of the particle with liquid Xenon produces both photons and electrons. The photons travel on their own to the top and bottom photodetectors. And they want to detect these photons. Through application of electric fields, the electrons are drifted towards the gas xeon and then converted into photons which are captured by the same top photodetectors. To capture the electrons directly they would need to have one more detector type. It would also have to be reasonably non-obtrusive to the optical photons.

Also, original line said 'typical' atom. So, that's got to be the most common isotope, right?
was my thought too. i mean, a half life like that sorta says to me we might not understand everything fully...
So could this be use to provide evidence that some matter existed before the beginning of this universe? Am I totally missing the point?

As someone very uninformed in this area can someone explain to me why, if the half life is so large for Xenon, some atoms are breaking down now?
Totally missing the point. The point is that almost all xenon atoms that have been made in nucleosynthesis are still around as xenon atoms. Some small fraction are now iodine and a much smaller fraction are now tellurium.
They need/want a lot more information. They have measuring direct scintillation photons on top, direct scintillation photons on bottom and photons from electrons on top. They mention some ratios being used. Also, the direct scintillation photons tend to have more accurate time and energy information. Last edited by raxx7 on Thu Apr 25, 2019 1:00 pm
Not really. Nuclear decay is not a deterministic process. A half life of 2 years, for example, merely indicates there's a 50% chance that a given atom will decay. However, if you have several lumps of 100 atoms of that element, on average, all the lumps will have around 50 atoms left after 2 years. Last edited by hestermofet on Thu Apr 25, 2019 1:01 pm
The half-life isn't an expiration counter, it's, well, a half-life. It's a period of time where, statistically, half of any initial population of atoms will have gone through the process. For any individual atom any single moment is as good as any other one.
Because it's a probabilistic process. In any slice of time dT, there is some finite chance of a random event happening. When we talk about decay, particles that undergo that event are no longer that particle, so the number of particles left diminishes. So, we talk about a ""half life"" as the time it takes for a chunk of material to ""lose"" half its mass to decay. (the mass didn't disappear, it's just not the same type it was earlier). But the probability is just based on each atom and whether it ""decides"" to spontaneously decay. And the odds of it happening now are the same as a year from now. So even though the decay of Xe-Te is exceedingly rare, put enough Xe atoms together and you'll rarely see it happen. Edit: Properly, it's a stochastic process.

Liquid xenon, I thought... how cold does that have to be? -108.1C, it turns out, but more interestingly the liquid range of xenon is really short - it then turns solid at -111.7C, a little over three degrees of liquid range. But then checking the other noble gases, they also have fairly short liquid phase temperature range, 3 or 4 degrees in each case.
Hmm, yes, but is that typical-now or typical-then, at the formation of the Earth? In the latter case - which actually makes more sense in the original phrase since we're implicitly including former atoms of uranium that could by now be lead - most of the uranium at the formation of the Earth has decayed away, far more than half.
How are we able to conclude the half-life on such vast time scales? Experimentation seems unlikely .. so maybe it's inferred from the structure of the atom in some way?
Fascinating piece. Are there significant safety differences among the current models of helmets that are available? There are so many designs, but I was told by a bike store employee that they’re all equally safe, which didn’t sound that plausible.
Is this different from the slipping tech called ""MIPS""?
oldArsReader didn't read the article fully, I think, but I agree that any review of helmet technology that doesn't at least *mention* MIPS is incomplete.
No mention of MIPS? Or the crazy weirdos like me that don't wear a helmet?
If you're trying to track these down, Trek is putting these helmets out under the Bontrager brand. edit: Ah, I now see that did get mentioned in the article. Carry on!
As a Dutchie, I am of the firm opinion that only tourists wear helmets. Edit: Alright, tourists and sports cyclists. Then again, if you live in a country with motorists that aren't submissive enough and that lacks good cycling infrastructure, I can understand. Last edited by dj__jg on Sun Apr 14, 2019 8:50 am
I’m a bit surprised that Ars has missed covering Hövding helmets. While traditional helmets are just that, a Hövding helmet works as a skull airbag. It is equipped with motion sensors, to activate it when a fall is detected. Really lightweight and discrete, and much safer than pretty much everything else in the market.
I don't get your thought process. I've known a few people who've hit curbs, potholes, etc. and gone flying and they were glad they had a helmet on.
I'm an avid motorcyclist, and I've commuted near daily on a motorcycle for near 3 years now. I've always been a bit put off at the... simplicity of motorcycle helmets, in that they're just a shell around some EPS foam, almost no different than a bicycle helmet for orders of magnitude more speed and momentum in a crash. Of course there has to be *some* kind of safety/materials engineering, but it always seemed to me as if it could be done better. Seeing this makes me hope they'll incorporate some of this technology into future helmets, I can see how it could work sort of like miniature crumple zones/shock absorbers and you can't get enough of that in a motorcycle.
On brief peruse of the ""paper"" mentioned, part of the Conclusions notes ""Results of SLIP (MIPS) and CELL (WaveCedll) group helmets demonstrated the potential that rotational acceleration of a headform can be significantly reduced by these helmet technologies. Differences in the efficacy between these technologies emphasize the need for continued research and development..."" The paper also noted that MIPS was not as effective in reducing linear acceleration.
Come cycling here in the trash-strewn streets of New York, a city where cyclists and pedestrians alike are sometimes run over by drivers who are then released without charge, or flee the scene, and you'd definitely understand. If it was legal to just kick a nice big dent in the asshole's driver door who almost ran you over, or kick their window out, the problem would go away real quick, but I digress. The helmet in question is here for $240. There also seems to be a Commuter Version for $120.
Or a person who gets away from their good cycling infrastructure paths. As a mountain biker and racer, our needs are very different. When you are threading through the trees at a good clip only clearing them by a small margin, a helmet is a good idea. The last time a helmet saved my bacon I was riding along a log (known as a ""skinny"") and an injured mountain biker decided it was a good place to sit and I didn't see him at first. It was too high up to put my foot down and was running out of space. Ended up falling off and hitting my head on the log. Would I have been killed? Probably not but it would have been very unpleasant without a helmet. The other thing to remember is that you fall vertically at the same rate regardless of how fast you are going, so even if you are barely moving, your vertical acceleration is the same. We had a woman killed a few years ago with indoor rollerblading at a stadium. Great infrastructure, no traffic, etc. She came to a stop and fell backwards and a helmet almost certainly would have prevented this. I've ridden in Holland and love the societal commitment to cycling and I know the pro vs. con arguments for helmets for these settings but MTB'ers, tourist or not, have very different needs.

My mom literally beat it into us that we were to wear helmets whenever we rode bikes. Imagine my disappoint meant when she was on the receiving end of a hit and run while bike riding and cracked her head on the curb without wearing a helmet. Luckily she survived (though it was a near thing according to the surgeon), but just coming off a deployment into having to help take care of a recovering severe brain trauma patient with a chunk of her skull removed for a month was extremely rough. She has recovered, though she continues to have short term memory issues and occasional headaches. I still don't let her live it down as the responding paramedic and neurologist both stated that she'd only would of had a concussion and her cracked ribs had she been wearing a helmet.
That is absolutely true. All bike helmets are required to meet certain safety standards. In the US these are pretty loose but in Europe they are much more strict. Most manufacturers sell their helmets in both places so almost all of them meet those strict European standards. I wouldn’t buy a helmet for $15 online, but if a reputable bike store sells it, and it’s a well known brand, regardless of cost I’d be confident in its safety.
Is there really a downside to wearing one though? Is this just a cultural thing for the Dutch?
The helmets all pass the same safety tests (ANSI and Snell). The higher price, the less you get in terms of material, so lighter and more ventilation. There are the MIPS helmets that others have mentioned and that adds some cost but again, two MIPS helmets, the higher priced one will generally be lighter. Now maybe there is a a difference in a specific companies helmets in the price range but they don't advertise it (and maybe there is a a legal reason for that). I'm not aware of a company that says, ""Hey, our $240 helmet is 28% safer than our $40 helmet."" or even vaguely hints at that.
It's true in that all the helmets meet the current safety standard. It's probably not known the degree to which the helmets exceed the safety standard because that just wouldn't be tested.
You have to lug around a helmet basically everywhere, that's about it. Bicycles are the standard mode of transport here for many people, so it would mean always having a helmet on you. Same with bicycle-specific clothing, also not really a thing outside of sports.
""I've asked around, and all my friend with stories about hitting their heads during bike crashes had helmets on - not a peep from the wind-in-the-hair crowd, though! Clearly, I'm better off not wearing one.""
Thanks, I've been meaning to check up on those. Agree completely that that should've made the cut.
I'm also very interested in seeing a review of this helmet and is the right fit with the type of products Ars covers. A bike airbag helmet some of the benefits of airbags (supposedly supporting head and neck position) and none of the cosmetic issues like heat or helmet hair.
Those kind of accidents are extraordinarily rare in normal traffic in the Netherlands. That's a different story at higher speeds, like if you're biking primarly for sport, racing, or using an e-bike. Accident statistics pretty clearly show that traffic+habits matter more than helmets; I can't find exact figures, but if this is right (https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/ni ... -nederland) the dutch cycle around 10 billion miles annually (around 1.7mi per inhabitant per day, which since even babies are often bike passengers probably implies that a significant minority simply doesn't bike), and fatalities have been on the order of 200 annually for years (https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2018 ... s-in-cars/), so that's just on the order of 20 fatalities per billion miles, or around 100 times lower(!) than in the UK (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/h ... 60291.html) - frankly that sounds almost implausible to me, but I can't see where those numbers are off, so maybe it really is that extreme... Most biking fatalities in the Netherlands are of people over 65 years old, even though they only account for a small fraction of the passenger miles, and over 75 the risk per mile jumps almost another order of magnitude. Assuming that the age distribution in the UK skews younger, the real difference for a comparable person is likely even more than a factor 100. So: on the facts alone, helmets are almost in the noise; traffic + culture matter hugely more. If requiring or heavily encouraging helmets were to significantly reduce the number of bikers, thus reducing the awareness amongst cars and the investment in infrastructure, that might quixotically reduce safetey. Still, that doesn't mean those 200 a year fatalities couldn't be even lower if people in the Netherlands habitually wore a helmet and otherwise kept their habits similar. (I can't help but wonder if fewer drunks wouldn't help too, but hey..., let's be realistic - and at least they're not in cars). Also, the numbers I looked up above are from a few years ago; but e-bikes are taking flight in a huge way, and the higher speed really matters, so the case for helmets in the Netherlands may be strengthening. I guess it should come as no surprise that although helmets help considerably when an accident occurs, it's even more helpful if you can prevent most accidents in the first place, and that appears to be eminently doable.

I bought one of these a couple of weeks ago. Despite the hype-filled skepticism-inducing advertising campaign, the helmet is actually quite well-designed and extremely comfortable. Fortunately I have yet to put it to the ultimate test. I had a 20 year old Bell helmet for mountain-biking. It was time for an upgrade.
In my opinion you should protect yourself if you are doing something where you are likely to get hurt. But I really don't see a reason to wear a [seat belt] in the center of [Atlanta] where traffic is slow and [car lanes] abound. This [seat belt] craze is getting out of hand... You probably wont need a helmet/seat belt on any given trip but the consequences of not having one when you do need one are serious. I (used to, really) bike all the time on trails around Atlanta and I see maybe 1 of every 100 people on road bikes NOT wearing a helmet. Why the hell wouldn't you wear one? Now I don't know if I'd pay the exorbitant asking price for this one. Sure, any head impact probably isn't good but in fifteen years I've hit my head biking twice. Not like I'm playing football.
Amen. To contribute to proof by anecdote :-) , I once went down because I stupidly hit a curb cut at a bad angle. Cursed at myself while going down because I knew what I had done wrong. No cars in sight. I felt my helmet bounce on the concrete. Sure glad it wasn't my head bouncing like that. Scraped up several things and broke a thumb, but my head was one part that wasn't hurt at all. Granted, being age 60+ probably doesn't help. those twenty-somethings bounce a lot better.
You don’t have an order of magnitude more speed and momentum, you have modestly higher speed and momentum due to the higher rise height. Just as with bicycle helmets, the helmet protects you from a fall to the ground. It does not protect you from a fall into a wall or vehicle. That would require a crumple zone similar in size to what is found in a car.
Always Always take your sunglasses with you when you try out helmets. You'd be surprised how often, the shape or curve is incompatible with strap locations on helmets. I ride a lot, road and XC MTB. I've got helmets in the past only to find out that some of my fav riding shades for super hot days won't fit or creates pressure points(not awesome on 5+hr days) Cooling super super important, for big days or racing. Mesh insert!! super awesome for backcountry and in the bush keeps the bugs out..nothing worse that hornet rattling around in your brain bucket. for the Helmet haters.. having cracked, smashed, chipped and destroyed helmets myself, it is surprising how many hazards are out there. A simple low branch on a tree can provide you with a nasty blood gushing scrape, filling your eyes with red ooze. Looks awesome but a pain clean all the blood off your kit and your bike. Protect your brain, protect your eyes and get the hell outside!!!
As a motorcycle rider, I'd say the largest annoyance is that helmets mess up your hair. But wearing them, you look like an astronaut. So I just keep mine on all the time. Problem solved.
I agree. The article would have benefitted from a comparison between this tech and MIPS. Last edited by Mugge on Sun Apr 14, 2019 9:51 am
Yeah, the new helmets are so much more comfortable than the older ones but keep in mind, it's a bad idea to have such an old helmet. The foam ages and stiffens, it's exposed to skin oils and salt in sweat, and also changes due to UV exposure. It's way, way past it's design life. A good rule of the thumb is about every five years and considering how cheap an entry level one is, it's not that expensive. I replace every three years due to frequent usage.
The point is addressed in the article. Honeycomb patterns are actually a bit too rigid.
Come visit your local trauma hospital and then tell me that you aren’t wearing a helmet anymore. I have seen them save numerous lives in low and high speed cycling accidents. Wear a helmet folks. On a side note, I just laid out my bike three days ago and need a new helmet so this article seems very well timed. Great to see my orthopedic colleagues working on advancing safety!
May you never need to do so. My wife is training for a half-Ironman. I think I know what her Mother's Day present will be.
I have a relative who is a neurosurgeon and a biker. It is hilarious to see him tear anti-helmet folks apart at social gatherings.
I'm glad Scott Kelly made it back to earth, and despite the changes, his body endured. Beresheet, however, failed to land safely on the moon moments ago. Space is hard.
What we need is a set of nonuplets, put all of them through astronaut training, send three of them to the ISS, and expose three other ones to the same level of radiation. Easy peasy!
Direct exorcise seems like a temporary solution to the issue at large. I wonder if we will employ suits designed to give constant resistance to an extent mimic the efforts needed on earth. This would give the added benefit of working out the heart consistently as well. Unless we go through a sort of revolution for space ships and habitats to eliminate all forms of radiation leaking that's going to be a persistent threat as well. I wonder if people are going to be confidently traveling the solar system to colonize in my lifetime. Seems likely.
I sincerely hope the mental decline is temporary. This is tough news for any extended human presence in space. If we can't figure out how to effectively shield from radiation, this might lead to future astronauts encountering some of the issues of groups like coal miners and NFL players. I don't think that would stop many of them from doing such a fulfilling job, but if we ever get to the point of wanting a permanent colony on the Moon or Mars, these sorts of health impacts are unacceptable.
Seems like the study should have gone longer. I didn't see any indications in the article whether the changes from the transition back to earth had reached a steady state.
After reading the article, my biggest question is what is the name of Scott's twin?
And superpowers? What about superpowers? (An elevated risk of cancer is a sucky superpower, move over, Aquaman!)
Well, if we can truly exorcise the culprits, it might work out to be a good permanent solution. Demons are known to cause a lot of problems . I think direct exercise will always be needed, as it does help to produce chemicals that increase immune stability, and other complementary benefits. That said, I think your idea of a suit that mimics the forces on earth is a good thought. It is probably far easier said than done however.
Unless Scott's brother spent an equivalent amount of time confined to an ISS mockup, he wasn't ""a great control"". To clarify, this experiment showed that there is some effect from being confined to a small, mostly closed habitat in zero-gee with a 90-minute outside light/dark cycle surrounded by electronics, with a slightly elevated cosmic-ray background. Now, which of those factors caused the problems?
It's good to finally see NASA finally evaluating astronaut health with a full suite of modern sequencing and molecular technologies. I interviewed by some NASA people to do bioinformatics work about 5 years ago and made some comments about surveying the microbiota within the space station and a manager there told me that the inside of the space station was completely sterile, as if that were at all possible for a space with partially unclothed people in it. Glad they're coming around. This study is certainly cool but I don't see how they'll separate the effects low gravity and space radiation on human health versus the effect of a living in musty space station air for a year. Lastly, I can't wait until the microbiome field moves beyond microbiotic species richness as a proxy for ""health"" and relative abundance of species as a proxy for something with any kind of predictive power.
I agree it should have been in the article, but his twin is (US) famous in his own right thanks to the unfortunate situation involving his wife. His name is Mark.
That's why he was a 'manager'. To say that ISS is 'sterile' is.......not thinking in a smart way (to be kind). Just keep him away from any important stuff.
As well as once having been an astronaut himself.
Not a direct control but there is a large database (including some twins, IIRC) for submarine crew. There is a large, largely opaque literature on what that does to people. IIRC it was generally subtle, generally negative but not easily teased out from just being alive.
Didn't a Russian cosmonaut also spend a year in space in parallel to Kelly? I'd hope he was also compared to a brother on earth.
Yes, Mikhail Kornienko spent a year on ISS along with Kelly. Don't know about a brother. Edit- Valeri Polyakov holds the record for consecutive days in space with 438 on Mir.
Which one is now the younger twin again?
Why not Octuplets? Octomom was already willing to go through that after all
Perhaps some kind of post mission blues or something? A pretty huge life change, at least!
Now that would take some in-depth research and some serious computations.
Also adjusting to gravity again- I have heard- is a chore.
Well, Mark Kelly is the most exhaustively documented human subject on the planet. Scott Kelly wasn't on the planet for most of that documentation. edit: spelling
Mark Kelly is husband to (sadly) former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who narrowly survived an assassination attempt that left six others dead, including Federal District Judge John F. Roll A two-time Space Shuttle Commander, Mark Kelly resigned his Astronaut commission to care for Gabrielle, who suffered a serious head wound. He is currently running for United States Senate against incumbent Republican Martha McSally, appointed to the seat vacated by the late John McCain. Mark's campaign is accepting donations here.
I just can't look at the photo at the top of this article without hearing the drum fill from ""In the Air Tonight""
Yes, well, that part was in the article. I do wonder if Mark's earlier trips to space make him a poor control for this type of study. At least with respect to longer term issues.
Ten years from now, another biological study will be made comparing the brains of Mark and Scott. With progress, one hopes we might be able to better understand and someday even reverse the adverse effects of exposure to Congressional service.
I wonder if this is more related to physical exhaustion (related to physiological changes to the body that probably wouldn't be able to be reversed in 6 months) than it is to a direct link to chromosomal changes. Is there a difference that we care about? Well, hopefully one could be counteracted, even over short time periods, without chronic-like treatment measures, while the other might be permanent (and require supplements, genetic therapy, whatever).
Humans evolved on Earth, thus our bodies are unsuited for space. Kinda sad, but totally expected result. I sometimes wonder just how far our technology needs to advance in order for us to be able to leave this planet and survive out there. The amount of genetic engineering involved just to make a body that can survive in zero g would be so great as the end result might be a species that isn't even human anymore. An alternative could be figuring out how to create some kind of human machine hybrid. At least if part of a machine breaks down it's replaceable, unlike our bodies. I really hope I get to live long enough to see what happens in the future with regards to space!
Wildly speculating here, so perhaps a not insignificant longer lifespan in space but balanced out by more chances for DNA damage-induced mutations, i.e. cancer...or superpowers?
You might be interested in Frank Herbert's Dune.
I suspect that by the time humans start arriving on the Moon / Mars in any significant numbers, AI will be approaching human level capabilities. At that point, AI will essentially take over all exploration/colonization activities. Humans will live in space / on other planets mostly just ""for fun"", like most humans living in exotic locations on Earth. But I agree that even for that purpose, we will require significant augmentation. The standard human is very poorly suited for living anywhere besides Earth. At some point, sending standard biological humans into space to do anything useful will seem as ridiculous as sending a horse to Mars for transportation. https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/proje ... 228a89.jpg
Why would you want to be adapted to zero g? Just rotate the fucking spacecraft!
And you know this how? Most of the issues are basic fluid mechanics. The question is how much gravity do we require for the fluid mechanics to operate adequately?
I'm not even that concerned with long term health effects; a slight increase in cancer risk isn't that big of a deal. The issue is that humans require a massive amount of infrastructure to survive for even a moment away from earth. Even just the requirement for humans to breathe air is incredibly limiting when it comes to space exploration and colonization. Seriously, consider if the Apollo program couldn't develop the lunar rover for some reason, and they decided to send a horse along for the astronauts to ride, on the moon. Think about all of the life support equipment a horse would require, all of the extra food and water that would need to be taken. Even just dealing with all the horse shit would be a nightmare. A battery powered car is orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of mass and energy. The same thing will eventually happen with humans. Why send humans at all when the robots get good enough? They don't even have to be quite as intelligent as humans, given their advantages in almost every other aspect. Even now, the thought of a huge farm on Mars growing vegetables for human colonists to eat looks like an incredibly inefficient way to turn sunlight into useful work/cognition. It's the best we can do right now, but it seems like an incredibly poor long term solution. And the reason to adapt humans to microgravity is that it is surely more fun. Earth level gravity is such a drag.

No, the Moon is hard.

Set my alarm to watch this AM. Amazing time to be alive!
The Youtube channel Veritasium has a really good feature on how to interpret this image (made before we saw it, but it ended up looking how they expected).
I have been waiting for this all day.
I strongly recommend watching Veritasium's video explaining the image of a black hole. Derek does a very good job explaining and demonstrating what we can see, and cannot see, due to physics of a blackhole. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo
Wow, this is great! I remember when I was in high school thinking this would not happen, at least not in my lifetime but here we are. I look forward to what knowledge the future holds.
Just to a layman's eye, it looks like this is a vindication of the models, which is pretty cool. The black hole in Interstellar was based directly off models. Last edited by Snark218 on Wed Apr 10, 2019 9:02 am
Thanks for the fast write-up. The press-conference has just ended. The size of the ring is about 50 micro arcseconds or 670AU During the Q&A session they said that this is the total light image. They are working on the polarized light (thus estimating the magnetic fields involved) They are also working on SagA, but it will take longer because of it`s faster rotation. (they said 1000x faster) The angular size will be similar though.
I had this streaming on my phone so my son could watch the reveal as I took him to school this morning. His reaction: ""I'm going to tell everyone I know."" Mission accomplished, EHT.
I'm curious as to how much time it would have taken to transmit that data given the presumably limited bandwidth available at each telescope site.
I have stared at nothing and seen everything.
Very nice to see an article already up at Ars at the same time as it's breaking across the web. For reference, here's how they made up what some describe as essentially 'a planet sized telescope':
I know this is image created from radio telescopes (at least that's what another site is reporting) and not optical telescopes, but cool no doubt. Still, always thought they would behave as a 'point source' pulling in from a spherical event horizon, not something which appears as the classic sci-fi 'flat plane' black hole. Last edited by Photon_plumber on Wed Apr 10, 2019 9:03 am
Also - can someone explain the upper row? source: https://twitter.com/PhysicsWorld/status ... 8751533056
Thanks, I was wondering why we got M87's black hole and not SagA*
It is a point source (actually, a point sink) in the far field. We see it as a flat plane, because photons have to leave on certain paths to reach us. Essentially, everyone sees the same ring-shaped object with a black disk in the middle no matter where they're looking at it from.
It's the Great Celestial Donut Charlie Brown!
I don't think this is totally correct -- our orientation relative to the accretion disk ought to alter the characteristics of the ring we see relative to the size of the event horizon. Everybody sees a luminous ring, but it might be more or less uniform, relatively bigger or relatively smaller. I think. But I am commenting way out over my skis here.
If you don't read about this, look at photographic proof of a black hole and how it appears around its event horizon, pondering the borderline incomprehensible environment that lay within, both in awe at being alive to witness this and feeling so overwhelmingly tiny a part of this universe... I can't say I envy your lack of curiosity and desire to understand, to put it politely.
I keep waiting for ""and one more thing..."". I thought they would start with the M87 picture and then end with an even better one of Sgt A*. A little disappointed that they didn't get it but the M87 one exceeds my expectations so it's still cool. People mentioned ""it's moving too fast so they can't get a clear shot"", if that's the case which way is it moving too fast? Or is just that it's not bright enough and not that it's moving too fast?
From what they were talking about while that image was showing, I was under the impression that these images were the result of a large number of high quality simulations.
Serious question here, the shadow is perfectly circular, at least to my untrained eye and mind but from what I read is that if the shadow was a bit lopsided then it would mean that there are additional physics at play here other than the Theory of General Relativity. I haven't seen any sort of preliminary response on that from any source. What is general response from researchers on this?
FedEx ships hard drives at a pretty reasonable rate.
I think it is a bit more complicated. During the press-conference someone mentioned 6m3 of HDD`s. Some of them came from the South Pole and they had to wait a few months because it was winter during that time (April) Then they played the data and synced it with atomic clocks. I guess it would require a dedicated multi-terabit connection. Interesting how the square kilometer radio telescope project will do it.
I was not referring to the accretion disk. We can see those around any number of black holes. I'm specifically talking about the edge of the event horizon.
I'm not sure if you really want to take the chance of adding the possibilities of transmission errors to this amount of sensitive data.
It`s also 1000x smaller (SgrA*). Conservation of angular momentum at play, I guess.
Great bandwidth that way, but the lag is a killer. 86,400,000 ms ping.
https://twitter.com/coreyspowell/status ... 3207574529
Not terrible by comparison if you're going to undergo a ~2yr computational campaign with the delivered data!
If you squint you can just barely make out matthew mcconaughey falling towards the event horizon, but never crossing it.
In his analogy to imaging a coin across the ountry, John mentioned ""if [it] were glowing in radio wavelengths."" Also, continuous mentions of millimeter and submillimeter arrays. I'm not sure why you thought this was optical. Except for the interferometry section that applies to all types of photons - visible (~1/2,000 of a mm) or much longer. Doing this type of worldwide interferometry with optical wavelengths is, in theory, possible. However, your timing and positional information would have to be three order of magnitude more accurate.
I believe its because we are orbiting SagA* and are comparatively speaking very close to it. Take a picture from the passenger seat of a moving car. It is very easy to take a picture of the mountains, but taking a picture of the trees right along side the road as they are zooming by is much more difficult. Apparent motion.
So essentially, we are close to having two examples to work with, both with very different characteristics. I assume SagA is going to be a real PITA too since we have to view it through half a galaxy of dust clouds... Amazing achievement for the EHT team!
GRMHD = General Relativistic MagnetoHydroDynamic simulations. SANE = Standard and Normal Evolution MAD = Magnetically Arrested Disk a_* = Black hole spin R_high = Temperature ratio that dictates how strongly electrons and protons are coupled in different regions Basically saying that if you turn all the physical options in your simulator to ""on"" (GRMHD) and sweep the parameter space (trying different spins, models of growth, and temperature ratios) you can see how well different models match the observations and place constraints on the physical object you're trying to model.
5 open access papers are out: ( The Astrophysical Journal Letters ) https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205 EDIT: In a few days the whole raw data will be made public as well. Last edited by ivekadi on Wed Apr 10, 2019 9:18 am
Well, yeah, if your experience with police is that they'll hassle you even if you don't do crimes, why don't you go ahead and do crimes anyway?
I've always been suspicious of broken-windows policing, and it's unfortunate there aren't many better quality studies out there. Pretty sure I read somewhere that one cause of higher rates of ill health in US minority populations is due to more environmental stressors. Question is whether or not the apparent statistical drop in crime rates over the short term is worth damage that could be happening on the generational scale. (my personal guess is 'no')
The plural of anecdote isn't data.
This is about as shocking as saying water is wet. Human psychology. Treat someone poorly and make efforts to exclude them from society, they feel they do not have to respect societies rules since society doesn't respect them. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Police are aggressive on minorities because they are criminals. Minorities commit crimes because the police are aggressive towards them. Inversely, treating people like human beings, treating them with respect, fosters cooperation and good behavior. Who knew.
Anecdote =/= data. Come back when you've published a paper Edit: ninja'd by Sajuuk
This is related to the switch of local cops from ""peace officers"" to ""law enforcement"". Cops seem these days to be more aggressive and seem to want to escalate rather than de-escalate. Yes, I'm generalizing, but while my interactions with them is minimal, I have noticed a change over the last 20 years - a lot of cops seem to have contempt for civilians - I suspect that it might be becasue a lot of ex military go into law enforcement, and they bring all that baggage along for the ride. As a middle aged white adult unless the crime is significant, I have no intention of involving the cops - the ""us vs. them"" mentality is exceedingly strong with them. I can only imaging what it must be like to be brown in this environment, especially with the message that ""brown is bad"" coming from the ultimate LEO. Leadership needs to address these issues top-down. The local police are NOT a military organization, and force is to be used only as a last resort.
Going to go with a ""no duh"" on this one. If you call someone an criminal all day, and they feel they are not, they will start to sympathize with the criminals assuming they are in the same boat. Its the same as the modern trend of calling every conservative a Nazi or every liberal a socialist. If everything is socialism, nothing is. Words lose meanings and the extremes of society seem relatable since ""well I doubt hes a nazi if Im not, that person is just a reactionary!""
Not sure this sentence is correct in any interpretation.
I work in an area of DFW with community building oriented police. I am not afraid of Plano PD officers, and I feel good waving at them as we pass in traffic. I can go a suburb or two over and be absolutely terrified for my life for a simple traffic stop in Garland -- officers have a history of approaching vehicles with hands on weapon. Or I can go to Richardson and know I am going to get fined for every possible idea of an infraction the officer makes up (city with traffic ticket driven city budgeting). And small DFW suburbs mostly have bad guys with bullying issues for cops. It's a very top down problem -- what are the attitudes towards the public as propagated by management and municipal budget expectations. The fact that you can drive 15 miles down the same road and have 3 or 4 different expectations for how a law enforcement encounter might go tells the whole story. I can't even imagine being a brown person in some DFW suburbs. I had enough trouble in some of them just for having a Hispanic surname. Last edited by aaronb1138 on Tue Apr 09, 2019 11:26 am
1. It sounds like the policies are working as intended. 2. Studies that back up what ""everyone knows"" are valuable. 3. This thread is gonna be racist shitshow.
Endless loop, ouroboros, mobius strip, chicken and egg. The statement doesn't need to be correct. It is the justification given to behave badly, which then becomes the predestination paradox that causes the very problem it was attempting to solve.
The American military actually has higher standards for violent engagement than American LEOs. I'm not an expert in the subject matter, but from what I've gathered it's a matter of vastly increased militarization without the accompanying training and discipline combined with the lingering philosophy of ""law and order/tough on crime"" that started in the 60s. American police departments are given massive amounts of surplus military equipment but no de-escalation training, and when your only tool is a hammer (on top of systemic racism and classism)...

I would think that the nature of this study would make a non-blind cohort less than optimal.
Unfortunately costly surveys are about the only good way to work on the issue. Bad behavior and policing is super strongly correlated and both feed into the other with a variety of effects. Gangs may avoid police or actively attempt to counter policing, for example. I take a pretty liberal stance on writing up structural models for inference, but I know that people tend think about simulation-backed causality tests as being scarcely better than necromancy. We definitely need more research into mechanisms to prevent the negative effects of policing, as well as the effect of better training on policing outcomes.
It is astonishing just how many adults don't get this. Manager who dings employees for everything; no matter how good the work is it is never good enough and the employee gets a talking to anyway. Guess what will happen?
Treat people like criminals and they will react in ways that reflect that treatment.
Rebellion, and the thought of if im going to be prosecuted like a criminal I might as well be one seem to be youthful thoughts that would apply here. Cant say im all that surprised. It sucks that the public at large is more willfully ignorant in the face of more data than we have ever had in modern society about modern society.
Bullshit. Decades of Feminazi!!! shouted by far right shitheads somehow didn't turn feminists into Nazis. But the folks who marched in Charlotte, NC chanting ""Jews will not replace us!"" And their supporters are, literally, Nazis and fellow-travelers.
I'm guessing that it would depend on the nature of the ""statistical drop in crime rates"". If you are talking about less graffitti, maybe. If you are talking about less murder, probably not.
More and more LE organizations are moving towards the ""community policing"" model favored in the 60s/early 70s based on this exact perspective. It is a massive cultural undertaking and ground-level officers themselves are often the biggest stumbling block. That said, as someone who has covered law enforcement in various contexts for years now, I'd argue the situation is a little more nuanced than a lot of people want to admit. If you're an officer who legitimately does not have a racist bone in your body (edit: let me rephrase that - ""an officer who is aware of the implicit biases everyone holds and takes great pains to stay mindful of them while on the job""), but the brown guy you pulled over for speeding reacts badly and makes accusations because he has experienced discriminatory behavior from police in the past (a near-certainty), the situation is bound to be terse from the onset. Same thing if you go into the field with noble intentions but all you perceive is criticism from the newsmedia, social media, etc. I'm really hoping the situation changes as the younger generations fill the ranks and bring their own political/social ideals to the field. Transparency, fair treatment, and truly colorblind handling of individuals is the only way things are going to heal, but things are so tense right now any goodwill is like a house of cards.

Generalfeldmarschall, your contributions are not necessary.
Ending stop and frisk has worked wonders in NYC.
If they are responding to everyday interactions with the public by pulling out their sidearm and shooting unarmed folks as a first resort, then I would say that the media criticism is justified.
Teens rebel against authority, film at 11. It stands to reason that the greater the pressure by authoritarian types, the greater the urge to rebel. See the stereotypical ""preacher's kid."" That this would be counterproductive is incredibly obvious.
Wow, who would have thought that police acting like an occupying army instead of fellow residents of the areas they protect who just happen to try and keep an eye on things would result in people being wary of the police? To say nothing of what happens when they put people in a chokehold for selling loosies and killing them, driving up to a black child and shooting him point blank, and so forth. Ending this mindset is easier said than done, obviously. But it's the main thing to address. The gang-like mentality of never ""ratting"" on your colleagues, even when they engage in egregiously illegal behavior (planting evidence, beating the shit out of suspects, etc.) is another huge issue. Not living where you work is arguably another big issue as well. I have rather strong opinions about cops here in NYC who patrol Brooklyn or Manhattan but live in Westchester or Staten Island. Paying a cop who patrols in Manhattan enough to live in Manhattan vs. some dumpy part of Brooklyn like Brownsville would almost assuredly infuriate a lot of police officers, though. It's... a thorny issue.   As someone who moved to Richardson for college (UTD) and has lived in Garland as well, yeah, backing you up. Garland operated under a siege mentality, but considering its schism between Hispanic and ""working class / old white people"", no shock there. Richardson just wants to fine you for everything. Some trash blew into my yard from a neighbor once and I got fined for it. The less said about what I had to go through to not pay that, the better. Plano mainly just deals with teenagers bored out of their fucking minds who subsequently turn to whatever intoxicant they can get their hands on and chasing away homeless people, from what I saw before I moved away in late 2013.

Heres a pretty good article on a similar case, where treating people like criminals makes them start acting like one https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04 ... ards-crime You can easily see how treating someone like a ""femnazi"" (a laughable term) would make them sympathize with more radical people who are also being called and treated the same. Feel free to apply this common sense logic with terrorists, far right extremists, racists, gangs, school yard bullies or outcasts. Talk about going beyond the evidence! Also, Radical Feminism is a fringe philosophy which has made common cause with the far right (the same ones who were shouting Feminazi) to harass transfolk in recent years.
Quote: What's the impact of aggressive policing policies, like New York City's former ""stop and frisk"" approach to high-crime communities? The evidence suggests that aggressive policing can work to lower the crime rate in some neighborhoods, but it also comes at a cost: lots of innocent individuals stopped and resentment of the police within some communities. While crime statistics are relatively easy to gather, these later issues are much harder to quantify. ""Stop and search"" rules, such as in New York are clearly a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Quote: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Clearly, this was written as a reaction to cover things exactly like this - soldiers targeting random people, or even people they ""just don't like"" for random searches and harassment. I don't care if these random searches do create a small dip in crime in the affected community. Part of the price of our freedom as a society is dealing with the added risk of some criminals going free. The rights of the individual are the foundation on which our freedom is based. Without individual rights, we have no freedom as a society, and we might as well just go back to rule by Kings and petty tyrants.
It's not ""because"". It's ""increases the likelihood of"". The same way that being poor does not make people criminals, but it increases the likelihood. When you deal with individuals, you have to treat them as individuals who make their own choices. Circumstances play into that but it is ultimately choices. But when you are dealing with policy that affects populations, you have to think about the probabilities and likelihood. If the chance of a person in a given demographic committing crimes is, say, 2%, and being harassed by police increases that to, say, 3%, you can't say on that basis that a given individual who committed crimes did so because of the way they were harassed by the police. But you can still conclude that harassment by police resulted in increased crimes. You also can't conclude that people who are harassed by police will become criminals; even with that effect, the majority of people in the demographic who were harassed never committed any crimes. Those numbers are just made up for purposes of discussion, it wasn't obvious to me in the paper what they would actually be.
I hope you're right. I live here in Portland, OR, and have a good friend who tried pretty hard to become a police officer. I was never really sure why (sounds like a terrible job to me), but it's what he wanted. He's a smart, friendly guy in good shape, knows how to think for himself, clean record, all that. He couldn't get hired at a single police department in the city or surrounding metro. He was consistently told that ""it wasn't a good fit."" All the other candidates he met during the interview process rolled up in jacked bro-dozers with military haircuts and barbed wire tattoos. We had a scandal recently where it came out that a Portland police officer was coordinating over text with the leader of the alt-right Patriot Prayer morons. My friend ended up getting a job at the zoo and he seems pretty happy.
Motherfucking this. Anyone who doesn't get this, read up on what a public policy is and what is expected to accomplish.
Look. Here we have a specific article on a specific study on a specific population. Your first post here was trying to tie his specific data to something not studied and not relevant -- radicalization of the far-right in the US. That isn't useful and isn't correct and isn't how science or evidence works. In fact, it looks like an attempt to justify behavior of the US far right and blame their critics. That would be pretty shitty to do.
It makes sense that if the police have an antagonistic relationship with you, you're going to have an antagonistic relationship with the law. I hate that the default advice is ""never talk to the cops"" but then every time you suggest that this worsens the relationship between the public and law enforcement someone has an anecdote about how they were totally fucked over by a cop who was abusing his position and acting in an untrustworthy manner. This sort of dynamic is seemingly guaranteed to foster a deep rooted distrust in authority which is going to make people feel like they aren't treated fairly. When people aren't treated fairly they lash out, become disaffected, and even depressed. It's absolutely terrible for society.
I've always suspected that dark matter and dark energy will end up being disproven once we understand how the universe works a little better. I'm glad we've at least ruled out one possibility.
We are getting there but we are still in the infancy level in many areas of the space knowledge and technology.
Putting words into other people's mouths is another way...
""Dark matter"" and ""dark energy"" are merely words to describe the observed phenomena that galaxies behave as if there is a lot more matter in them, and that the universe accelerates its expansion. Those observations are not going to be disproved (though perhaps refined). The open question is what causes it.
Two questions. I understand this was a pretty big survey looking and a good chunk of sky. However, was the resolution truly good enough to rule out primordial black holes? Secondly, will this team be likely to get their proposed follow up survey of 10 days telescope time?
Excellent article, much thanks. A few typos, though: evidence for the identify of dark matter Yes, the Cosmic Microwave Background and the structure of the Universe itself both indicate that dark matter was there right from the start. If the primordial black holes are heavy enough, the rate of defections would be much higher than it is.
The thing that you maybe don't understand is that the phenomenon that are behind those names definitely exist. So there's really only explaining WHY they exist. The names are called ""dark"" because they're unknown. But gravity is an inherent property of ""matter"", and there aren't any other known sources of gravity, so the presumption is that it's an unknown to science matter that exists in great enough mass to impact the movement of galaxies, but for whatever reason remains directly unobservable. The label ""dark matter"" is a scientifically convenient label, not so much the name of a known substance. The same for dark energy, only it's a different phenomenon that can't be explained by gravity. It's an unknown energy that, on a universal scale, seems to be ""pulling the universe apart"". It's more complicated, but basically, gravity doesn't account for it, so the presumption is that it's some kind of energy acting on the fabric of the universe, but exactly what that energy actually is remains unknown as well. So, assuming we are clever enough to figure it out to an acceptably high degree of confidence, there WILL be ""known"" substances/energies/influences to account for the phenomena labeled ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"", at which point those terms won't be used anymore in favor of whatever is actually causing them. So, the proof of what they are is mandatory before we can drop those terms, and that proof won't ""disprove"" the terms, since those are simply symbolic place holders until we know what the hell accounts for the observed phenomenon each is pinned to. I hope that helps clarify your understanding.
Good post, thanks. I tend to use the term ""fudge factor"" which is probably overly-provocative. I like your use of ""place holder"".

I think the ""Yes"" in the middle of that paragraph was supposed to be a ""Yet"".

""Invisible stuff hiding in plain sight"" is a bit... meh. if it's invisible it obviously wouldn't have any problem hiding in plain sight. it wouldn't even have to hide, just to stay out of the way. Which is kind of the point: it doesn't. We observe it not staying out of the way. If and when we find dark matter, it's likely to be something we didn't figure out how to detect earlier on its own. That's almost a truism, but only almost. We did figure out neutrinos exist way before we figured out how to detect them, after all. The analogy even extends to that we figured out that neutrinos must exist because of the things we can detect behaving the way they do, which is exactly how we figure out dark matter must exist and have a certain class of properties. We see things move. None of that is magic. it's all about refining our models of reality to match observed reality, isolating the changes we have to make to do that and adjusting our approach based on additional observations. This article is about the last one of those: assuming those observations we can't produce a corresponding model where all dark matter consists of agglomerations of baryonic matter. If you read all that as ""a fudge factor to make the math work"" I'm inclined to consider that to be your problem.

They're also more and more observable as we hone our skills. Dark matter is what it is and doesn't concern itself with what we imagine it is. I hope to know more about it in my lifetime. If it is un-observable, then it could be several lifetimes or never that we understand it. That I hope it's observable and understandable is just preference. Again, it is what it is and doesn't care what we imagine it is. Yet your earlier comment did not characterize a bias against ""exotic"" particles as a hope but as a likelihood. The goalposts... they move so much.
As for not finding primordial black holes ... if they're small (much less than star-mass), wouldn't they have evaporated due to Hawking radiation by now? What's the minimum-mass black hole that should exist based on the age of the universe?
Einstein's maths was because Newton's maths didn't work for all the observed universe. The current maths doesn't work for all of the observed universe , it's possible that current maths could be replaced by other maths that does. Unlikely but not impossible, rigidity hinders science.
I've repented and acknowledged the term as overly-provocative, agreeing that ""place holder"" is a better term. Of course the math works... observation is the problem. Let it be whatever it is.
“870 megapixel monster attached to an 8 meter telescope” That sounds like a fun piece of hardware. Biggest telescope I’ve ever used was the 32-incher (0.8 meters) at Appalachian State University. That was in 1997, so our sensor might have been a whole megapixel. Editing to add: I know the ~$20,000 CCD camera on the 14-inch scope at the same school was VGA-quality.

The lowest mass primordial black holes would have evaporated by now, Hawking calculated that 1011 kg would still exist.
The paper has a figure that shows they have (mostly) plugged a gap in earlier exclusions, there was not much chance of black holes as dark matter anyway. But the observation is nice to have of course! Which brings me to one of my pet peeves, when positive observations are cast as ""detections"" but not ""seeing"", as if electromagnetic emission or reflection is the only way we see things. In popular vernacular we see shadows, say. Dark matter is observed in many and independent ways, from the dark matter peak contribution in the cosmic background spatial spectra, over baryon acoustic oscillations in the galaxy cluster distributions, and virial observations of galaxies, to gravitational lensing. Maldoror wrote: ""Dark matter"" and ""dark energy"" are merely words to describe the observed phenomena that galaxies behave as if there is a lot more matter in them, and that the universe accelerates its expansion. Fatesrider wrote: The names are called ""dark"" because they're unknown. jnk1000 wrote: I tend to use the term ""fudge factor"" which is probably overly-provocative. I like your use of ""place holder"". Oy. Let me try to cover possible misunderstandings here. ""Dark"" is usually a moniker to denote that there is matter and energy that do not interact by emitting or reflecting electromagnetic radiation. Cold Dark Matter [CDM] - massive (slow, ""cold"") matter particles - and a dark vacuum energy [Lambda] is a part of the current Lambda-CDM inflationary cosmology. Dark matter do show up in many ways, and the popular misconception that it only explains galaxy rotation curves is behind many fringe papers - typically on ""alternative gravity"" - that can not hope to fully explain dark matter observations. Cosmological expansion rates depend on the internal state of the universe and varies between inflation, radiation dominance, matter dominance, and currently vacuum energy dominance eras. In all of these rate distributions the scale expansion is accelerated (non-linear), it is just that pre-inflationary big bang cosmology had no reason to expect the early inflation and late vacuum energy exponential expansions. As dark matter is a) (various sets of) observations and b) physics, they cannot be mathematical ""fudge factors"" or ""place holders"", that is inappropriate terminology besides being rejected by observation. I find it interesting albeit not surprising that non-astronomers have been normalized to black holes (""dark holes"" according to the ""unknown"" interpretation) and their current general relativity singularity physics, but not to dark matter and dark energy as simple quantum particle physics. It is just a matter of time.

I still don't think you understand. It's not the use of some term that matters. Something with our understanding of the nature of reality is fucked up. It could be our theories of gravity, it could be our understanding of what kind of gravity-creating particles exist in the world. (Theories about the former have a worse track record than theories about the latter.) This absolutely requires a fudge factor. Dark matter is the name we've given to that fudge. What peeps are trying to figure out is the nature of that fudge. Unfortunately, it really, really doesn't look like we can just write off our observations requiring that fudge, not on this one. Boy, we all wish we could. Nobody likes dark matter. So it's not what you call it, fudge factor or place-holder. It's the mistaken idea that dark matter will be proven a mistaken idea. Lol wut? All we k ow is that we don't know. There's no theory there, only a recognition that our observations don't match up with our models! Fudge factor is all it is at this point!
Oh dear me. Anytime we see the term ""explosion"" we know that we are looking at more than 4 decades old ""big bang"" cosmology. The realization that the universe cannot have ""exploded"" because a) it is homogeneous, isotropic, flat and low entropy and b) there is no preferred ""explosion"" volume to start out in was what replaced that with modern inflationary cosmology. Which has been tested against data and accepted since the 00's and on. And again, there is no ""force"" that makes the universe expand, it is its internal state that decides the expansion rate. The analogy is rather that of a rocket leaving Earth, what velocities will it have as it escapes gravity? Cosmology 101,. I recommend Susskind's Stanford MOOC on this.
I often think of dark matter and dark energy as the 21 century equivalent to the Michelson–Morley experiment. Where you have an unexplained observation. Like with Einstein, accolades await those who can solve the puzzle.
IIRC, a primordial black hole of 10^12 kg would be just about evaporating at the current age of the universe. The mass of the Sun is 2x10^30 kg. The mass of Halley’s Comet is around 10^14 kg.
Einstein's maths didn't replace Newton's maths, they just extended the applicability and moved some of the rules to the underlying topology. You can reproduce Newton's maths from Einstein's when you take the convergent limit after assuming linearity in some places where it doesn't exist. Newton's maths are perfectly suitable for plotting a Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assist to Jupiter or a Jupiter slingshot for New Horizons to Pluto, even though we now know that particular math isn't exactly correct. Current maths becoming replaced by a more general one isn't unlikely let alone impossible, it's pretty much inevitable. It'll still resolve to current maths at the appropriate limit after making some relevant simplifying assumptions: we already know that our current models work given some assumptions, we just aren't sure what those assumptions are because we consider them to be axiomatically true. To me it seems like the most likely outcome is that this next generation model would simplify to quantum mechanics given a smallish set of assumptions and to general relativity given another, inherently incompatible set. I even have an inkling of what that model might look like, but we aren't talking about my personal krank theories here.

If some random guy named Chuck on the Internet hasn’t found them, they must not exist. You bring such incite to the discussion.
If you take a look at the standard model, it ends up seeming a lot more plausible. There's a bit of a zoo of particles with associated fields. We already know that the photon doesn't interact strongly with the neutrino and the higgs. The idea that there are other particles that don't interact much with the photon (and the EM field) doesn't seem very far fetched. The current dark matter theory seen as most likely is CDM, cold dark matter. Particles that move ""slowly"" (vs, say, the neutrino). There's a wide range of possible candidates and we've managed to narrow that down to energy ranges that would be enormously difficult to detect. This is a similar situation to the one we were in before the existence of the neutrino was confirmed which was postulated in 1930 but wasn't confirmed until 1956 because of the difficulty of detection.

It's more complicated, but basically, gravity doesn't account for it, so the presumption is that it's some kind of energy acting on the fabric of the universe, but exactly what that energy actually is remains unknown as well. So, assuming we are clever enough to figure it out to an acceptably high degree of confidence, there WILL be ""known"" substances/energies/influences to account for the phenomena labeled ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"", at which point those terms won't be used anymore in favor of whatever is actually causing them. So, the proof of what they are is mandatory before we can drop those terms, and that proof won't ""disprove"" the terms, since those are simply symbolic place holders until we know what the hell accounts for the observed phenomenon each is pinned to. I hope that helps clarify your understanding. Good post, thanks. I tend to use the term ""fudge factor"" which is probably overly-provocative. I like your use of ""place holder"". Yet you still stand behind the claim that it's merely to make the math work. Would your proposed alternative be to have a universe where the math doesn't work? Einstein's maths was because Newton's maths didn't work for all the observed universe. The current maths doesn't work for all of the observed universe , it's possible that current maths could be replaced by other maths that does. Unlikely but not impossible, rigidity hinders science. I've wondered about that too. Newton --> Einstein --> ??? I'll meet you at the stake where they'll burn us as scientific heretics. I'll meet you at the BBQ to celebrate your Nobel Prize for replacing the ??? with something worthwhile. I'll keep the champagne on ice.
Your position seems to be ""we don't know anything and we can't know anything."" If so, you'll just have to excuse everyone else for trying to find out about things.
Did you know you can quote the post you are replying to? Like everyone else does? The link marked with a quote is kind of a hint...
The mice then went online and ordered advanced tickets to the Electric Daisy Carnivale.
that picture is so nice... i want to be that mouse lol... ratatouille? is that you?
So what I learned from this is that I should take ecstasy before studying a new language?
Could you say the same thing about Alcohol or marijuana, and how shy people will become more social in crowds etc. Or is this different? Cause I mean, if I could pop some ecstasy and learn a 2nd language easier, or lean how to program, I mean, that's like a win win right? Having never done this drug or known anyone who has, I don't know the side effects.
Time to pop some Molly and go on a Duolingo bender. Will report back.
You've missed out.
The major finding of this study is that the drugs seem to cause long term effects, lasting for several weeks, long after the short term ""high"" has faded.
I worry that the causal relationship might be tenuous, and the article does hint at it, but not strongly enough. Let's assume the brain learns via reward. The reward is a specific neurotransmitter. Brain has evaluation function that says ""whatever is happening now is good, needs to be rewarded"" -> learns to associate [now] with [good]. So lets say the evaluation function changes over time, and the same ""whatever is happening now"" is no longer rewarded as good. (Old mouse) But now lets flood the brain with REWARD. Such that the brain now evaluates ""whatever is happening now is good."" As you can imagine, the ""whatever is happening now"" can literally be ANYTHING and the mouse is now associating it with ""good"" simply because it's being flooded with reward. It has nothing to do with social, and all it might be demonstrating is that mice brains LEARN from REWARD. Flood brain with REWARD and they LEARN. It also doesn't show that there is any connection between age and social. Whatever the evaluation function is that doles out the reward might be all that is changing, and by flooding the brain with reward, you've circumvented the lock. The evaluation function might actually be part of the network itself, and would require a LOT more work to tease out how it evaluates, and why it changes over time. Basically, I'm not sure this demonstrates what is claimed, and suspect the real driver is even MORE complicated to determine, especially if it is part of the network itself.
Mandatory ecstasy for the first day of high school?
I'm inclined to disagree there. The behavior wasn't ""what's happening now"". It was specific social behaviors that had previously been no longer rewarding in which the mice no longer interacted. Had it been as you suggest - an indefinite reward response - then the behaviors would have been reflected in all activities, regardless of the social benefits. Moreover, the regions were studied in those mice which had both naturally active and naturally inactive activity, and associated the changes to a specific kind of behavior prior to using the drug. There is no note of unusual OTHER activities that would be more indicative of a broader ""reawakening"" of the previously inactive regions of the brain, either. The lack of that observation in the experiment suggests the behavior was specific to the rewards of social interaction that happened in younger mice happening again in mice that had stopped engaging in that kind of behavior. I think you've overemphasized the idea of ""reward"" there and didn't look carefully enough at the conclusions. Had the observers seen unusual OTHER behaviors, they would have had to have reported them, since it's an observable result (even a negative result yields a result). Moreover, there is no neural transmitter involved in the experiment that re-established itself in the brains of the ""socialized"" mice. The drug stimulated those receptor sites, but it wasn't the neurotransmitter itself that did it. This means that the stimulation is important, not necessarily the neurotransmitter that does it. And the sites stimulated related DIRECTLY to social interaction, as it was the specific region stimulated and studied. So, no, I don't believe your hypothesis is correct. You've made a false assertion (that the impact was greater than that recorded) and ran with it without allowing for the controls involved. The data as presented doesn't lend itself to your interpretation.
On a more serious note, second the above: the study does seem well-designed but additional research is probably well warranted into this very interesting area. Effectively, at least in part effect: an anti-brain-aging drug. Apparently.
Are they in need of human volunteer test subjects?
Since the effects are apparently long lasting, not using mdma at all, or at least no recent history would probably be a pre-requisite.
One thing i didn't mention with the story is that they did a sort of control for general reward-focused behavior: cocaine! Basically, in mice, the cocaine experience triggers a strong reward response, and will form the same sort of positive associations without the social interactions being necessary. So, they repeated parts of the protocol, but swapped in cocaine for the reward stimulation. There were clear differences in the responses, enough to suggest that the two pathways at best only partially overlap. Can't stuff everything in a story and still have it read like a story.
Can't...stop...looking at the mouse...so cute...hypnomouse...

Well that must be a fun lab. ""Hey, I need to order some ecstasy and cocaine! For ... research!""
What's interesting here are the ""only child"" mice. Do only children naturally have lower levels of Oxytocin that make forming friendships more difficult? As an only child, people tend to treat me like I have some kind of mental illness when I admit that fact. Perhaps I do?
Yes. Absolutely. Possibly terminal social mal-adjustment is your inevitable, and inescapable fate. I'm positive I've known some only children. From vague memories of childhood, it always seemed to be parents who made a quiet fuss, as a kid, I can't remember ever giving a crap, just parents seemed weird about it. Edit: ah. Now. Memory working. Nope. Only children I knew were very sociable, particularily in their early 20's. Thanks for that.
We need more context on that last sentence. When they ask if you're an only child, does is happens after a heated argument at school and/or work?
One of the things i remember most clearly from my graduate education is a faculty member saying ""it's easier to get cocaine legally at UCSF than it is to get a phone installed at Berkeley.
Gigaflop wrote: But now lets flood the brain with REWARD. Such that the brain now evaluates ""whatever is happening now is good."" No. That's not what's happening at all. There is a window of time when mice are capable of associating positive social interactions with other factors surrounding those interactions. As the mice get older, that association gets weaker until it ceases to exist. They were able to open that association window again, not provide rewards. steauengeglase wrote: What's interesting here are the ""only child"" mice. Do only children naturally have lower levels of Oxytocin that make forming friendships more difficult? Nah. The levels are likely the same as group children, they just don't have the social experiences for association to drive their responses. But this is actually an area that's been studied fairly extensively, and it's been found that within a year or two of schooling (starting at typical age around 4-5), it's essentially impossible to tell only children from children with siblings. Any maladjustments to sociability after that point are down to the child in question and their parental situation as opposed to their social environment.
I can only speak for myself, but MDMA has helped me MASSIVELY in becoming social. I used to be super-introverted, it were so bad that my parents thought I had Asbergers. However, the first time I took MDMA everything changed. All the fear just went away, and after just an hour or two I deeply realized how pointless the social fear was. I just talked about whatever I wanted to to everybody - and my fun, confident and carefree attitude made me just that. All the weight I always used to carry went away instantly. For example - I put my arm around one of the cute girls there, since I 'obviously' were attractive, and the fact that I thought so about myself actually made me attractive. It was never about my looks, it was about how I looked at myself. Before that night I was way too timid to even keep serious eye contact with her, but that night I didn't have any fear. And without the fear I realized I didn't have anything to fear. That night stuck with me. I didn't suddenly become a social butterfly overnight, but about fifteen MDMA nights over the past few years, combined with great self-help content from Bulldog Mindset and the like has changed me massively. I can't really understand it myself, but now I'm super social and extroverted. I LOVE people now, but just a few years ago I almost passed out on the bus because of social anxiety. Now people like to confide in me because I deeply listen and emphatise, and girls like me because I just have fun and don't fear stupid stuff. I just wish MDMA could become more popular as a self-development tool, it's one of the best things I have ever experienced. Because I express my love for the world, other people and myself in how I act, people express their love for me. It's awesome. <3 Last edited by kris33 on Thu Apr 04, 2019 5:56 pm
Oh no, it doesn't work quite like that. The paperwork and provenance for monitoring those drugs has got to be a royal PITA. Two people weighing out tiny amounts of material. Signing off every time something gets tossed. Locked cabinets. Paperwork. Forms. Inspections. If you want a good time, call Ken at 555-1212. Don't try to go into research with controlled / restricted substances. EDIT: John T: What lab were you at in USCF? In the biochem depart we dealt with some precursor chemicals that could be made into various Schedule I drugs. It could take literally half the day to deal with the paperwork. (1976-1977). Of course, radioactives like Phosphorus-32 were trivial. I guess the salient point is go after the final product. Of course, it wasn't hard to get *illicit* cocaine. Not hard at all.....
I can 100% relate to this. I was very shy growing up - nothing crippling but I had very few friends as I simply didn't know how to make them. Talking to girls was usually a horrifying experience. Oh sure, I was married and had kids but was socially awkward until may late 20s and there was always a bit of depression about my life in general. What changed? A 3 or 4 year bender on X where my corp group of friends were introduced to it and it became a pretty much an every weekend (every other weekend at a minimum) experience - at bars, at social gatherings and even just hanging out at someone's house shooting darts and drinking it up. It was life changing in that I learned, much as these mice did, how to become social. In reality, it was losing that fear/care of what others thought of me. I realized that if I could be that way using it, why couldn't I be that way without using it? It's been probably 15 years since I've actively taken it (maybe once every 6 months it was available in the right setting) and 3 years since I've touched it at all (I'm almost 50 now) People that know me now flat out don't believe I was ever shy or didn't know how to talk to people (girls, especially). I'm just a fun, free wheeling, flirty, life is an adventure to live and enjoy kind of guy now. I can't imagine every being depressed - I don't even think I could be if my wife left with the kids, my job fired me and I lost everything. Honestly. I'm not sure where I'd be absent those 4 wonderful years and the bonding and growth of my friends from a few to hundreds. I should also say there's a caveat to me ""quitting"". Either a) I got old enough to not enjoy x hangovers (imagine having an alcohol hangover for 2-3 days and, lacking serotonin due to depletion, you cry at car commercials for no reason - LOL) or b) the crap wasn't as pure as when I first started which caused the horrible hangovers (not to mention trying to sleep became difficult). Either way, while the experience on it didn't change, the experience afterwards started to suck and since I'd already come out of my shell and was changed for life, it wasn't something I needed any longer. As I said, to ""change"" one's personality so drastically at such an older age than usual, the experience very closely resembles this study, though the usual YMMV applies.
So many little back rubs
I suspect that it actually kind of sucks. MDMA is a schedule I and cocaine is schedule II; so they presumably had to fill out the special registration form, deal with way more hassle than normal chemical supply purchases, adhere to the storage requirements; and generally do paperwork and hope that nobody decided to go looking for diversion in the lab. DEA schedule 1 may be less hassle than CWC schedule 1 substances or some of the higher BSL pathogens, that I'm not sure; but it's not a fun addition to lab administration.

Well, it'd be good training for TheRealWorld(tm) and Mandatory Fun Day at work https://images.app.goo.gl/dgBkGsuvHTM9qMgs5
Did they attend the Deadmau5 show afterwards?
Does this potentially explain at least part of how SSRIs can treat social anxiety? Or have researchers tried blocking oxytocin and finding it wasn't affected already? It seems like there's at least one fairly common oxytocin receptor defect and oxytocin is one of the areas I'd like to learn more about and see more research done on.
I have worked at a few companies which could have benefitted from having the drinking fountains regularly dosed with MDMA.

Had it been as you suggest - an indefinite reward response - then the behaviors would have been reflected in all activities, regardless of the social benefits. First off, thanks for the fantastic retort. While Ars added the ability for me to tell ars why I up/down voted, I still can't figure out how to see the results for my own post, so having such a great response helps me understand where I might have gone wrong. That said, maybe I can clarify (and correct) my position better and hope you will be willing to expend a little more time to steer me in the right direction. I come from an artificial intelligence background and am not a neuroscientist (but I'm of the view that our best shot at general AI is studying current general intelligences) Our current deep learning models don't have a concept like neurotransmitter. Well they do, but it would be as if there was only a *single* one. It is modified by a reward function. For every action, a reward (or lack of one) has to be assigned, which is then backpropagated across the graph. In biological systems though, there are many many neurotransmitters, but they all basically come down to one of two functions -> ""reward"" or ""punish"" -> read: excite or inhibit. But it begs the question, if they all perform the *same* functions, why use many instead of one? I haven't found an answer to this, so I suspect we might not yet have one. (Would love to find out I'm wrong) Even more complicated, some neurons only react to certain types, some can use multiple types, and some react inversely to the transmitter (they are inhibited instead of excited) My horribly naive and novice guesses (must not fall prey to dunning kruger) are a combination of two things. 1) Biology is a noisy and dirty environment, and this complexity partially evolved to insulate different clusters of neurons from getting accidentally excited/inhibited by nearby activity. 2) This allows different types of clusters of neurons (read networks) to cross - communicate at specific and important junctions without losing the ability for them to talk to their direct networks. We have no analog of #2 in AI right now, and my hopelessly naive view is that this is going to be key for general intelligence. Without continuing off this tangent, my point was less about oxytocin or MDMA's exciting of neurons (and the fact that they appear to affect and excite the same types of neurons), and I'm not arguing that they don't have a role in ""social"" learning. But I'm trying to say (using a horrible metaphor and sounding terribly pedantic) is that someone can ask ""why is the ground wet?"" and the response can be ""because there is water on it"" (oxytocin) or someone can say ""because it is raining due to the storm rolling through right now"" (evaluation function). I point this out because one of the big problems in properly training a model is figuring out how to reward it. Rewarding or Not IS the fundamental core of training/learning. How do you evaluate the state of a system and determine if this teeny action (the action of a single neuron firing) is beneficial to the end result? How do you evaluate that this specific move in go, placing this one black piece in this one location should be rewarded or not? This is hard, wildly hard. And I believe this is a big part of why it takes so long to train AI. We rely on backpropagation, the evaluation function is extremely ""gross"" as in, ALL of these moves led to victory. The model has to very slowly over time tease out the relationship between a single move and the end result. It is possible to build many reward functions however. Set small goals, reward them. This accelerates learning. Rather than allowing the AI to try to figure out all of the interim steps by only rewarding the end state, you set specific rewards to specific achievements that are known to lead to the end-state. At the end of the day though, there is something that has to ""evaluate"" whether or not a reward needs to be doled out or not. How is ""social"" even evaluated? How does a mouse KNOW when it is in the presence of other mice? How does the evaluation function determine that there are mice nearby, and the reward (oxytocin) needs to be released or not? Is the evaluation function triggered by the simple presence of chemicals in the air (scent?) or is there a neural network that has been trained (grown) that has to evaluate the existence and value of other nearby mice? To me, answering THAT question would be the true cause of answering why mice stop learning social as they age, but I admit there is great value in finding/identifying the messenger when we don't even know where to look for the source.

As the mice get older, that association gets weaker until it ceases to exist. They were able to open that association window again, not provide rewards. I suppose my lack of clarity in using the word reward has triggered multiple responses. On the most fundamental level, reward/punish (excite/inhibit) is the VERY BASIS of learning. It is the basis of all learning when it comes to neuron based life forms and deep learning artificial intelligence models. It is at this molecular level, that I'm referring to when I say reward. The ""associating positive social interactions"" you speak of is a higher order result of learning as a result of reward functions (excitation of neurons). edit: spelling Last edited by Gigaflop on Sat Apr 06, 2019 11:41 am
It's more you pop it and a therapist helps you improve your cognitive processes during a session. A subperceptual dose might benefit learning without hallucinations.
Interesting many other animals have this window where they can learn sociability. I wonder if it could be used to socially rehab rescue animals for example or domesticate animals that are ordinarily resistant to domestication.
""I'm not sure that keeping a 12 foot alligator as a pet is the best idea."" ""Nah, it's cool. Chompers just needs his morning molly, and he's like a cuddly kitten for the rest of the day.""
LOL saw this coming. I was thinking more along the line of puppy mill rescues but hey different strokes and all.

It's very possible that this research could eventually lead to rehabbing and homing animals that would otherwise be unadoptable and likely put down. That would be fantastic. But that ""eventually"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting, and draws attention to how far off such practical therapy is, and that's a rather bleak rabbit hole. So instead, I'll think about crazy people taking their pet hippos to an EDM festival.
Good. At first glance this might seem to wander close to First Amendment territory, but the publisher in question engaged in outright fraud, trademark infringement, and arguably identity theft of the names of alleged editors.
As alluded to in the article, I get almost daily email invites to junk conferences (would I like to chair a session in 'Catalysis 2020' in Beijing/Dubai/etc? Er, no). Clearly there's money to be made here, so who actually attends these meetings? Likewise, these garbage journals.
Good news, good news. Couldn't have happened to better frauds.
Laugh all you want, but they said Crippen was crazy!
Same here. All the invitations seem to come out of the same template, so at least they're easy to toss into the trash bin, but it's still annoying. As to who attends conferences/submits papers, at a guess it's mostly people who need to bulk up their publication/presentation lists and who work at places that don't do much oversight of same.
Good. More frauds need a kicking.
I used to respond (a bad idea, I know) saying that I'd be honoured to participate if all my conference fees, accommodation- and (first class) travel costs were covered by the organisers. Oddly enough I'd never get an answer to that.
Hey fellow Ars beings. I have recently come across incredible offer. All y'all qualify for inclusion in ""Who's Who of <your country here>"". I am not even about the joking. Send your cashes and person information and I will add you to famous publication quickly!
That's actually quite surprising. I would have expected the defense to at least deny everything in the complaint, but it sounds like they didn't even do that (or at least, not competently enough to have a trial). At this point, you begin to wonder why they even bothered to show up.
You forgot to tell us where to send our CC info?
To the Nigerian Prince, duh!
Publishing is seriously busted... having published a few major (relative) works it is a bit disturbing to me that I pay oodles to get it done and the company makes bucks off the publication while I see jack all from it. I don't even want much, just some minor royalty. This in particular though... sheesh... I thought Elsevier was jerky.
Quote: The commission then asked for a summary judgement in its favor as a way of avoiding the time and expense of a trial. In order to avoid this, the companies' lawyer would have to indicate that either some of the facts presented by the FTC were in dispute or there was something legally unsound about the charges it was facing. Quote: The lawyers did neither. Total lawyering fail. Do they work for the White House as well? None the less, the FTC did a good deed here. I just hope they can enforce their permanent injunction. Small operators like this often simply switch names and locations, and continue with the same fraudulent practices. Last edited by Lee Vann on Tue Apr 02, 2019 6:58 pm
Funny. In a sense, however, that's what the various impact-factor measurements are supposed to be for. An impact factor for a journal tells you whether other people are citing the articles that appear in that journal. It's far from a perfect metric, but it's something.
So... Why isn't there a list of these fraudulent publications available for those who might be aware that it's a thing these days to consult so they don't inadvertently feed those trolls? Or is there? If not, that would be a nice thing to add to a resource list. Dunno who's pay for it, but it seems to me that the more legitimate publications would find a vested interest in cooperative effort toward such a thing.
Wow.................. Now if only the FTC would go after predatory lenders, shady banks, and sleazy corporations with the same aggressiveness. $50 mil for the company in question is probably ""financial death"" to their operations. When will we see this for other entities?
Standard ""reputable"" academic publishing is a hell of a thing. Authors pay page-charges (which often can be thousands of dollars) to the journals. Which then turn around and charge libraries vast amounts of money (for large collections, can be millions of dollars per year) in subscription fees. Oh, and referees contribute their time/expertise without compensation either. Nice model for the publisher though.
It would be nice if the article could add what effect the judgement will actually have. US Courts make summary judgements all the time for overseas companies. Collecting the money seems more problematic. Does the company rely on any US based companies? Can they just go out of business and start a new company that continues the practice? Clearly money is being made, how much and where is it?
I would expect a company like this would not even bother to present any defense, but just close up shop and disappear for a while. They are in India, after all. When the heat is off, then you can open up a new scientific journal under a different name, or try your hand at some other form of fraud.
I don't think anyone is tricked into submitting to these journals: as dmsilev pointed out, there are ""universities"" that require X number of publications in ""international journals"" and that counts for promotions. I suspect this is also the reason most of the junk journals have ""international"" in their name. This is less of an issue in the US (though I'm sure it's also the case in some places) and much more so in developing countries. There's some bureaucrat with no understanding of academic research who evaluates your performance and if you don't have the funding to do good research, you're not going to do meaningful work anyway. Paying a few thousand bucks to get a promotion is just how everyone games the system. Bonus points if you get some funded travel out of it. Occasionally, you deal with such bureaucrats in the US, too. If you're a professor on a work visa, you are subject to random visits from an immigration officer. I've experienced a case where the professor in question was at a conference presenting his research and the officer found it absolutely unacceptable that this person wasn't in his office during the work week. He then knocked on everyone's doors and demanded to know how often this professor was traveling or working from home. I don't blame the immigration officer for not understanding the academic workplace, but that doesn't make being on the receiving end any less painful. And when your metric for certain visas is ""how many papers did you publish,"" with no criterion for quality (they don't have the first clue what a good journal is), then these journals are an opportunity.   https://beallslist.weebly.com/ The list used to be maintained by a librarian -- I don't know why he stopped. I assume it's because there are just too many to keep up. Fortunately, Gmail's spam filter is pretty good at catching them: I get at most one a month, but find dozens in my spam folder. They also scrape the web for titles of your papers. So you get something like ""I came across your publication titled 'Health Policy Updates' and think it would be a great addition to the International Journal of Solid State Physics.""

FTC fines company $50 million...and actually collects $0. Makes a good press release and forces this company to change names but I doubt it actually does anything much to the business model.
These things really are a scourge. Most are easy to throw out, but they create so much noise it is sometimes hard to tell. I recently got an invite and had to find a particle physics colleague to check whether it was a serious conference—I honestly couldn't tell from the invite and everything has a shiny website. (Turns out it is legit, so I'm glad I checked.)
I've been waiting for this. It's been simmering for a few years. That company bought Canadian medical journals is used their reputation to peddle crap. https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/junk-scie ... -1.3095411 Here in Canada a TV did an investigation. I can't find the episode but it would have been W5 or The Fifth Estate, two popular long-running investigative journalism shows.
A useful rule of thumb is never publish in a journal with 'International' in the title. At least for the life sciences, in any case.
It's India; slip enough rupees into the right hands and you can do just about anything. I have no idea where they keep their money, but if they have US assets, the court should just order them seized. Find out who owns the company and issue visa alerts; you try to come to the US, you're arrested and tried for contempt of court / failure to pay the fine, tossed in the klink for a few years, then deported. If you work there, just deported.
There was a time when dubious thoughts, ideas and crackpot theories could simply be published online without the need for a veneer of integrity. Am I the only one who misses those long-forgotten days of yore and the simple veracity of Time Cube? «sniffle»
The real question is why Google Scholar includes bullshit ""journals"" in their database at all. There are tons of legitimate Open Access journals avialable; it's a shame that Google chooses to muddy the waters just because someone can't be bothered to spend a few minutes making sure the journals in their database aren't terrible and useless. It would be trivial for them to just compare their own publishers list against one of the many lists of legitimate journals that already litter library-land, where this is already a significant field of study. /librarian
Fraud, defamation, Trademark infringement... yes, all of these things are illegal. Strangely, simply lying is not. You can lie and call it ""freedom of speech"", as long as your lie isn't being used to convince someone to give you money. I just love our society sometimes.
Pretty sure it's the name for the genre, not sure on whether it was / is the the name of an actual publisher. Vanity Press. People send the publisher a manuscript and the publisher turns it into a book. This has legitimate uses, such as the ""Freshman Orientation Handbook"" or ""Valued Guest's Guide to the Best Wedding EVAR!"" or, of more value, as an operations guide, -- whether the modern type of guide that pretty much says 'don't hold this up outside during a thunderstorm' or the obsolete three inch thick user manual. But have always been the ""Do you want your book published? We'll do, and we guarantee it will be a Best Seller."" Yeah, haha. That's fraud, false advertising. The USA FTC's domain. . You are valuable. If a company wants to hire you the company will pay to find you, court you, start paying you. No company that you want to work for will ever ask you to bribe them to hire you, and expect any such ask to be , hmm, can't think of a suitable word, I mean when me (grumpa) and those two ate all the brownies that were so good and and we said we hadn't their momma said ""bullshit!""
There is public utility in having scientists publish works, so I would have thought that some University peak body or government department like the patents office would step in and develop a crowdsourced peer review publishing web site. Have professors peer review in return for being able to publish for free.
Like the Android store and YouTube, Google WILL NOT PAY FOR HUMAN CURATION of CONTENT on any revenue source. Similarly if it can't be done in software code someone is interested in writing, they won't automate it. How many Google platforms must this play out on for people to pick up on the pattern? Does Stadia need to sell micro-transaction porn to 8 year olds week 1? (almost guarantee it will happen at some point)
Sounds like the competence of the companies' attorneys was on par with the veracity of their clients' publications.
To be fair the job frequently gets handed off to the junior members of the group as the PI is too busy for such menial tasks. That's not as bad as it sounds, as the senior grad students (and postdocs) are often far more up-to-date with the field and literature as it is.
Professional, publishing academic here… The business of scholarly publication is fucking insane. - My University pays me to do research. - My University pays ""subventions"" to publishers to publish my research (even to the most ""legit"", Elsevier journals). Insane shit like… I submit digital images (in color of course); we pay extra to publish them ""in color"" as opposed to B&W, when (a) they are being published electronically, and so (b) it take extra work to turn the color originals into B&W. - My Uni, and others, pay faculty for the time they spend serving as (unpaid) peer reviewers for the journal publishers. - My Uni buys back my research through subscriptions to the journal, often twice by paying for a print version and a subscription to the digital version. - My Uni then pays, literally forever, for archiving, cataloging, and maintaining access to my research. Above, for ""My University"" you can substitute ""the families of my students, and also all taxpayers"". Meanwhile, Elsevier and their rapacious kin make billions of dollars in profits. Happily, now that I am tenured and fully promoted, I have given my last fuck and just stick everything online on my own server, on GitHub, on whatever… let the natural peer review of the next five centuries of readers decide what it's worth.
Considering this is a reputation-based business, this news should harm their bottom line a bit. Better than nothing at all. Kudos to Ars for publishing not just the names of the companies but the individual's as well.

Oddly enough I'd never get an answer to that. They generally offer me large early bird discounts, like $200 in place of $1200. Such a privilege.
Research that uses even a single dollar of taxpayer money should be required to publish Open Access. Companies like Elsevier exist on the basis of mass theft from citizens.
The commission then asked for a summary judgement in its favor as a way of avoiding the time and expense of a trial. In order to avoid this, the companies' lawyer would have to indicate that either some of the facts presented by the FTC were in dispute or there was something legally unsound about the charges it was facing. Quote: The lawyers did neither. Total lawyering fail. Do they work for the White House as well? Keep in mind that lawyers are not allowed to lie. They can obfuscate, deceive, spin, selectively report, mis-emphasize, etc. but they can't actually lie. They're like Aes Sedai without magical powers. They probably could have lawyered their way around some of that evidence, but it's kind of hard to argue that an eminent scientist is mistaken when he says he does not do peer reviews for your journal. The Judge isn't going to believe whatever cockamamie story you come up with, she's not going to believe you believe the cockamamie, and she's going to refer you to the ethics board. And if they get pissed at you they can pull your license. Good luck making lawyer-level student loan payments without a law license. Quote: None the less, the FTC did a good deed here. I just hope they can enforce their permanent injunction. Small operators like this often simply switch names and locations, and continue with the same fraudulent practices. Especially small operators in India.
It sounds interesting, but I've already picked up some of that wariness about DePalma even in my corner of the internet. He sounds like a natural sales-person, which is great. But it also sounds like he has a habit of promoting hype to where he's not infrequently out over his academic skis.
We've had the smoking gun for about 40 years now. Seems like they've finally found where some of the bodies were buried. Cheers!
Thanks for covering this in more detail, John. FYI, other coverage has included two dinosaur species in the layer: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2 ... 144223.htm ""Smit also noted that the buried body of a Triceratops and a duck-billed hadrosaur proves beyond a doubt that dinosaurs were still alive at the time of the impact.""
I read about this a few days ago. A truly fascinating find. I believe they said it'll keep researchers busy for the next 50 years. It'll certain keep them busy for quite a long time.
Never Forget
The flood(s) wasn’t what lead to extinctions, they were local events. The smoke and dust in the atmosphere darkening the sky all over the planet and worldwide fires from fiery debris raining down everywhere did that.
Still alive and thriving are 2 very different things though. The 3 meter issue will not be disproven with a couple outliers, at least not yet. Regardless, the fact that this site is preserved so well will help clear up this debate in the years to come (or make it less clear?)
Talk about the find of a lifetime.
I had picked up from your twitter feed that you were skeptical based on the initial hype. I was waiting to form a judgement based on what you reported here. This seems a pretty solid discovery based on your reporting. It was probably over-hyped.

Seems highly underhyped to me. Nailing down time to the hours after the impact is crazy. How much better can a find possibly get? It was not mentioned here, but a lot of 3D structure was preserved here. Normally things are pretty squished. This has got to make some kind of all time top 10 list of finds.
Interesting. I don't know what the 3 meter issue actually is, and a perfunctory search hasn't illuminated the reference. To your other point, I should think that any dinosaur alive at impact would've have been part of a ""thriving"" ecosystem until the cataclysm. Could we meet in the middle and postulate that a perhaps declining population was finished off by the impact?
Spoiler: show The New Yorker has an in-depth story about this. Definitely worth a read. because Edit: Doh. Nevermind. Last edited by hotbbq on Tue Apr 02, 2019 1:57 pm
Certainly an exciting find, and we can expect a lot more expeditions to the area, searching for more evidence. But given the number of times Timmer used the word ""flood"" in the story, I get the feeling that he is just trolling the trollers right now...

No dinosaur fossil (apparently prior to this) had been found less than 3 meters below the line of sediment deposited by the asteroid impact. Put shortly, there's been no evidence that the dinosaurs were even alive at the time the asteroid hit.

Vague character assassination by heresay, not even supported by links. I also love the complaint that the results have only recently been presented. With the degree of skepticism the paper is facing, he should have published earlier and with even less evidence? No need to take him at his word, and the paper should certainly be subject to critical analysis and independent verification, but on its own merits. The New Yorker-published anecdote concerning Jack Horner resonates all too well with this former grad student: Quote: The discovery helped refute an old hypothesis, revived by the formidable paleontologist Jack Horner, that T. rex was solely a scavenger. Horner argued that T. rex was too slow and lumbering, its arms too puny and its eyesight too poor, to prey on other creatures. When DePalma’s find was picked up by the national media, Horner dismissed it as “speculation” and merely “one data point.” He suggested an alternative scenario: the T. rex might have accidentally bitten the tail of a sleeping hadrosaur, thinking that it was dead, and then “backed away” when it realized its mistake. * * * But, when I asked Horner about DePalma recently, he said at first that he didn’t remember him: “In the community, we don’t get to know students very well.”
I found that the article had a lot of fluff in it, like it was more a bio of DePalma than of his discovery.
Already the first link in the article.
I found the NYer article a bit frustrating. Lots of great information and a flavor for the site and work, but then it mentions the 3 meter issue (discussed above in this thread) and... drops it entirely. Never mentions how these finds might influence our thinking about it at all.
That would be the one I read a day or two ago. It is quite indepth.
Well, it is the New Yorker. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
He should publish his evidence instead of hyping his conclusions to journalists who aren't equipped to verify his analysis. Coordinating media coverage under embargo before actual scientists get a chance to poke holes in your results is classic charlatan science that's employed by the likes of Seralini.
I found the New Yorker article quite good. If even half of the stuff it claims was found at this site is accurate this should be one of the most important finds in the history of paleontology. Even the fluff bits about the guys life help people understand why he waited so long to publish and prepares them for the firestorm of controversy that will now erupt. Paleontology produces almost no commercially valuable discoveries, which means all the scientists have to fight over one small pie with no means of making the pie bigger for everyone. It is almost impossible for such a situation to not bring out the worst of human nature.
Salespeople don't always sell lemons. Sometimes they stumble across the real thing, which is what appears to have happened here. Good thing is, he was at least in the correct field of research with the correct contacts such that this site wasn't destroyed for pure profit or self-aggrandizement. They spent two years doing surveys before going public, and then another four years doing serious digs and analyses prior to letting loose with the PRs and papers. That seems pretty well done, even if a little self-serving in parts.
That's my issue with it as well, I suppose if they had mentioned that the site's findings related to the 3 meter problem would be discussed in an upcoming study it would be one thing, but it never does get back to it at all.

They do get back to that further down: Quote: At the bottom of the deposit, in a mixture of heavy gravel and tektites, DePalma identified the broken teeth and bones, including hatchling remains, of almost every dinosaur group known from Hell Creek, as well as pterosaur remains, which had previously been found only in layers far below the KT boundary. He found, intact, an unhatched egg containing an embryo—a fossil of immense research value. The egg and the other remains suggested that dinosaurs and major reptiles were probably not staggering into extinction on that fateful day. In one fell swoop, DePalma may have solved the three-metre problem and filled in the gap in the fossil record. And yes, all of this seems too good to be true and this article certainly reeks of sensationalism. But if even a fraction of these finds hold out against more scrutiny he will have every right to brag.

Yes/no. Palaeontology explains why certain parts of the University of Cambridge had such impressive buildings. When coal had the status that oil had in the late 19th century, identifying potential deposits that might be some distance down was of great importance. The Devonian isn't called that because the inhabitants of Devon named it. It is because finding certain deposits first identified in Devon was critical to finding where to dig for coal. It wasn't just about identifying rocks but identifying the fossils in the rocks. Academics were called in as consultants with very high fees. The Sedgwick Museum, where I first got interested in history of science, benefited from donations of specimens from some of these people. William Smith, the son of a blacksmith, was the pre-eminent geologist of the early 19th century and his strata maps of the country, based on identification of rocks and fossils, were a significant factor in the Industrial Revolution. Smith's survey around the Radstock coalfields led to the Somerset Coal Canal (I once moored a boat on it, hence the reference), but that was a minor part of his early career. You could say palaeontology has already done its job and paid for future research. Last edited by Voyna i Mor on Tue Apr 02, 2019 3:00 pm

That's as much, or more, an indication of how hard it is to find vertebrate fossils at all (because in general fossilization is a rare event) than of any specific indication of exactly when they died out. For example, only about 50 T. rex specimens have been found, covering their span of some 4 million years. That's one T.rex being fossilized every 80,000 years or so. (Of course the rate isn't anywhere near that uniform.) Edit to add: And as pointed out in several comments below, the so-called ""3 meter issue"" went away decades ago. Since 1991, dinosaur fossils (both bones and tracks) have been found within inches of the K-T (or K-Pg, in current terminology) impact layer. Last edited by alastairmayer on Wed Apr 03, 2019 10:51 am
I would definitely say that lack of evidence in Paleontology, much more than in other fields of study, is not necessarily proof of a claim being false.
Interesting to see an Ars post. I've been looking for one for 3 days now. I imagined that Ars thought it an April 1 joke and initially didn't publish. Agreed the launch is unusual, the date is unusual and the scientific cross validation is yet to come. Still makes me a little queasy. However if this is real it's an astounding finding. It puts some uncertainty to rest and enables a really great visualisation of the Chicxulub Event. The paper is peppered with words and concepts I didn't understand. The following might help other people to grok it a bit better. A point bar is beach on the inner side of a river bend. The place where all manner of stuff fetches up during a flood. Realising that helps to understand a lot of what they're talking about. Here's one in France on the Gorges de l'Ardèche. Imagine a 10 metre wall of water coming up that and sloshing to and fro a bit. The paddlefish is like this (the possible extinct Chinese species apparently went up to 7m in length!) The paper is here https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/27/1817407116 and the New Yorker piece (parts of which which read almost like a novel) here https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died For those who've read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, this site is reputed to be a little west of Bowman, North Dakota.

What three meter problem? People thought there might be a problem back when no dinosaur fossils had been found within three meters of the K-T boundary, now that we have fossils from right on the boundary the problem turns out to have never been real. They didn’t talk about the future of the problem because as long as the evidence in the article actually exists the problem doesn’t have a future. I really don’t understand what more they possibly could have said.
Based on what I read, I disagree with your ""has to make"" aspect. This is find #1 relating to dinosaurs until something else can make a case for knocking it of the top of the list. (I would argue that you have to time-box finds, because the various woolly mammoths with sequenceable DNA are also way up there for pre-historic finds)

We have fossils yes, but dinosaur fossils? 2 possibly, but that hardly puts the nail in the coffin on this debate. But like I said previously, in paleontology, lack of evidence doesn't necessarily mean an untrue hypothesis.
Both the photos in the New Yorker and the NYT are of the freshwater fossils they found, not of the ""broken teeth and bones, including hatchling remains, of almost every dinosaur group known from Hell Creek"" that he claims. It's certainly a big find, and the paper itself is very cool and I recommend people read it. But his public statements try to settle an important debate in archaeology that the paper never touches.

This always feels like a powder keg ready to go big time... Anybody interested in this might find this book worth a read: Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC - Tracking Ebola and the World's Deadliest Viruses by Joseph B. McCormick, Susan Fisher-Hoch, Leslie Alan Horvitz. https://www.amazon.com/Level-Hunters-Tr ... 454916656/
Virus doesn't respect borders. Why should WHO?
This scene in Outbreak always comes to mind first for me whenever I hear about Ebola, too.
I know in parts of the middle east the US did some shady stuff with vaccinations which lead to more misinformation, and distrust of actual efforts to curb deadly disease. Does this air of distrust also exist in African countries as well, or have we done similar things in the area here?
Hey asshole, these are human beings, not a fucking movie.
I'm not an epidemiologist or anything, but I can't help but wonder if humanity really is one vicious plague away from being wiped off the face of the planet. The answer is probably not, but it makes me nervous anyway.
Theres some pretty remote populations, it would be hard for any event to wipe everyone off the planet. Nuclear war included. Something cosmic may though.
Curious about this shady stuff.
Probably not a *single* plague from disappearing, but certainly a single plague from being seriously knocked down a notch. Something like Ebola, which has on average (depending on the strain) around a 30% fatality rate...30% of 7+ Billion People dying isn't nearly enough to ""end civilization"" but it would be more death than all our wars in the 20 and 21 centuries combined and that would give everyone a helluva different outlook on life afterward.
There have been some pretty awful plagues in the past, but nothing near an extinction. And those were mostly before modern medical care, although even places with advanced national health care systems would be severely strained by an outbreak on the scale of the Black Death. On the plus side, we've also got very sophisticated early warning systems in place. The entrenched civil warfare in the Uganda region certainly isn't helping things.
As part of the effort to track down Bin Laden, the CIA organized a fake vaccination drive to gather intelligence. When this came out there was a significant faction of people in those areas who immediately began to distrust international aid.
Ebola isn't virulent enough for that. It isn't all that easily communicable and good safety precautions make it unlikely to spread. Not impossible certainly and it is rather deadly when it does transmit. But this isn't airborne. Yet anyway. But yes, probably some pandemic will seriously knock us down. Probably something like the Spanish Flu strengthened by global warming (well, us weakened by it) and with Global Warming also causing massive health crises from drought, crop collapses, heat stress and heat stroke, etc.

You need to calm down a bit when youre called out on your jokes in bad taste.
Its not the worst reference, but its a gif at top of the first page. Perhaps use [spoiler ] tags
To imply we should be bombing people with ebola is a pretty bad reference.
granted, I suppose I am saying its not completely off topic as a movie reference, but it is without context.
As statistically deadly as Ebola is, it's relatively easy to contain with proper protective equipment, careful treatment of the infected, safe handling of the deceased, clean water, and hygiene. The survival rate is also highly dependent on the level of treatment provided to the patients. It's sort of a worst-case scenario for a region that's difficult for resources to access, and where safe handling of remains isn't going to be readily considered. But if two or three people showed up in Manhattan with Ebola they'd probably survive and then it would be over.
Autoplay.
Frustrating that as long as the death toll & suffering is confined to within one of our geopolitical boundaries, that country can be denied additional resources to reduce the spread... but as soon as it crosses one of those invisible lines in the sand: ""OMG, now its of international concern!"" SMH
Maybe the antivaxxers could volunteer to parachute into Congo and Uganda to spread the faith? Unvaccinated, of course.

I don't know. Because there's nothing funny or cute about this.
It's my understanding that the vaccine is very expensive and difficult to produce, and therefore is not being provided broadly to most people. Instead, it's being reserved for health care workers and those who have come in close contact with the infected. Most people don't have the chance to ""refuse"" the vaccine. The frustration here is the general distrust of the west, where medical clinics are being burned and health workers are being mistreated. Perhaps many people *would* turn down a vaccine, but I suspect not.

Perhaps many people *would* turn down a vaccine, but I suspect not. Correct. As the article notes, Quote: Uganda has already vaccinated 4,700 health workers in 165 health facilities because they're the ones on the front lines, and because the vaccine is scarce. This is the best use of it; there's nowhere near enough for widespread or even ring vaccination at this time.

"" https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-04- ... risis.html
However, the vaccines were real. It was the pretense that was not.
With clinics being raided, I doubt best practices will contain Ebola. Might keep it from leaving the continent, but neighbors of infected countries might be at risk.
Well there was the vaccine testing by a British multi national where the informed consent was conspicuously lacking. Then the DNA testing of Pakistani (again without consent) being vaccinated in attempt to locate OBL. The curious thing is why people wonder what the mistrust of western medical providers stems from.
Thousands vaccinated, apparent 97+% effectiveness - when does the vaccine lose its 'experimental' tag? Do formal clinical trials include almost 5,000 patients, and how are such trials run anyway? I imagine it's unethical - to say the least - for a double-blind study to intentionally infect people.
The vaccines were real, but the pretense matters. Imagine that a much more powerful agent than you or your community has lied to you multiple times in living memory about their intentions; it makes it difficult to believe anything they say. It is not a matter of actual utility derived, but rather one of trust. Some people or societies place a greater value on trust than they do on actual average utility. The US disregarded that (or, more likely, simply assumed they'd never get caught) when they did that. And now some people in the middle east will not trust foreign doctors.
OTOH, they didn't do the followup shots needed to make the immunity stick.

I've gone to about a dozen different practices to find someone willing to do more than take a bi-monthly appointment and shove opiates at me. There's light at the end of my tunnel, as it were, since I recently had a procedure that actually works for my pain. However there was a long period of time where I had no choice but to take something for the pain. I couldn't function with it, and I was worse without it. Thankfully, I'm off them completely now. But it was way too easy to get them or for someone (I don't think I ever did) to get addicted. All that is a long way of saying that these motherfuckers need to be in jail. A dozen god damned doctors to find ONE willing to actually solve the problem instead of shoving pills at me.
I am not an expert in business law. What stands in the way of the founders taking all the money out of their business, declaring bankruptcy, and just starting a new one that is the same as the old?
That Kapoor fuck looks like his hobbies include slowly lowering FDA regulators into pools of liquid hot magma. If they manage to avoid the fines coming their way, Chapter 11 Bankruptcy strikes me as something that needs to be overhauled to prevent this from happening again. You want to reorganize? Fine. You still have to pay your fines and penalties. Not worth it? The government should just seize everything you own and then sell it. I'd say start clawing back money from people like Mr. ""Bond Villain Stand-In"" there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of an LLC... Last edited by Deputy Cartman on Tue Jun 11, 2019 3:08 pm
Not much, if history is any guide.
No one needs to be in jail. They need to be flayed alive. We need to stop beating around the bush. We need to kill people. Lots of people. Kick down their gated community walls, burn down the mansions. Burn the Rolls Royce's. Kill the prize winning horses. Seize passports. Empty all bank accounts and forfeit all assets. Long, brutal public executions. Broadcast in 120hz 8k across the world.
The obstacle is the courts, they have the final say as to how the bankruptcy is structured and who gets what portion of the remaining assets. I suspect that if it looks like the founders looted the company before bankruptcy, the courts would be able to do something about that.
Am I the only person who glanced at the photo before reading the headline and thought scandal had come to Lewis Black?
Quote: Insys CEO Andrew G. Long defended the bankruptcy decision, saying: ""After conducting a thorough review of available strategic alternatives, we determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best course of action to maximize the value of our assets and address our legacy legal challenges in a fair and transparent manner."" Are they filing Chap 11 Re-organization, or Chap 7 liquidation? I know, the first sentence in the article says Chap 11, but it sounds like Long is talking about selling assets. Are they intending to sell some assets, and re-or as a smaller company? EDIT to add: Damn, I followed the link to the NPR article, and: 1. The photo on NPR looks even more like Lewis Black than the one here. 2. Yeah, Chap 11 re-or confirmed 3. I hate what they are using Chap 11 for... Quote: Under Chapter 11 protection, the company will be able to keep operating — paying employees and vendors — as they devise a plan to pay mounting legal expenses, including more than $11 million spent to defend Kapoor against criminal charges by the government, according to court papers.

The pusher don't care if you live or if you die. The pusher is a monster, he's not a natural man. If I were the president of this land, I'd declare total war on the pusher man. I'd cut him if he stands, and I'd shoot him if he'd run. I said God damn. God damn the pusher man.
Where's that dang civil forfeiture when you need it.
At minimum, the officers and directors of Insys should be jointly and severally liable for the fines. Also, the corporate veil should be pierced. Anyone who was a shareholder of the company when the violations occurred should be liable (but only up to their investment and any gain thereupon) as well.
Until CEO's get life sentences with no possibility of parole for 30+ years, nothing will change.
And if they can pay the fine, send them to prison. Maybe knock a year or two off the sentence...
You've described the foundations of American Capitalism.
Nope. I was planning on making some sort of evil twin Lewis Black joke, but you had to go ahead and ruin it by getting to this article before me!!!
This is too much. I don't have an 8k TV and I'm not buying one any time soon.
Hopefully the Sacklers are next in line.
We could always just do both to be on the safe side.
If the entire government weren't in the pockets of big businesses, the laws should be changed so that in such circumstances, the business is to be liquidated under the courts supervision, and any non-liquid assets (i.e. patents) revert to the control of the government, to be licensed/leased under reasonable conditions to any interested party and the proceeds of said licenses/leases used to cover the outstanding debt of the business. Oh wait, who am I kidding, like something that requires common sense would ever happen in our government....
Careful you don't let the republicans hear you talking about corporate accountability.
The opioids these people pushed, and the vulnerable people they targeted, make even the cartels blanch. I'm generally against physical punishment, but what these people have done to 10s of 1000s of families, and their blatant corruption of the medical system ... the angry side of me wouldn't be put out by an old-fashioned drawing and quartering. There seems to be NO line these people won't cross for a buck. At what point do we decide an example has to be made?
It isn't impossible to change the system. It is also reasonable to acknowledge all the things between the present and that future.
There is a ""clawback"" period: the bankruptcy trustee can apply to the court to get back funds that were clearly moved out of the business improperly. But it's easy to move funds out if the people running the company see the risk at least a year out, and there are a zillion ways to obscure moving assets later. There are big accounting and legal firms that specialize in doing exactly that.
Any criminal justice reform in this country needs to include overhauling laws that allow white collar criminals like these chuckleheads to literally get away with murder by declaring bankruptcy and paying a monetary fine. There's no excuse for these sociopath pharmaceutical executives to stay in Club Fed while everyday Americans rot in prison for minor crimes.
Let them hear me, and every other sane and rational person in this country screaming for them to be held accountable as well!
How dare you talk about JOB CREATORS like that.
<jonstewart> You can do that? =D </jonstewart>

Could you make them eat their own medicine and when they get hooked take it away?
There are a variety of legal mechanisms designed to stop this sort of behavior. First, bankruptcy itself will put a court or court appointment trustee (which is often times current management) in charge of the company, with the specific obligation to not transfer out assets. Some routine transfers will occur, but anything else would likely need court approval. A violation of that provision will result in a voided transfer and the court will just take back the money/assets. Further, if assets were discarded pre-bankruptcy, those can theoretically can be clawed back. And, in addition to the bankruptcy provisions regarding claw backs, other transfers may be voidable as fraudulent transfers. Practically speaking, recouping fraudulent transfers isn't always easy, particularly when the transfers are complicated, but can be done. Further, the transfer of assets pre-bankruptcy like that can be a reason for a court to deny bankruptcy protection to an individual or entity. I'm not saying shenanigans don't or can't happen. When they get away with it, it usually is because there isn't someone sophisticated or concerned enough to double check. But here you're going to have a lot parties that are very motivated to use the available legal mechanisms to address inappropriate behavior.
Regardless of paying the fine... The people running these outfits are criminals. Not only should they be looking at multiple years in prison, some of them should be facing a trip to Death Row. Why are these senior executives not facing serious Federal, State and local criminal prosecution?
I upvoted this, but there's really no need for the torture bit. Just a bullet in the head, it is quick and cheap.
Love the concept, would be ecstatic if it passed. In the land of realistic expectations, it has a snowballs chance in hell of making it to the Cheeto in Chief's desk, and less than that of being signed....
A school kid gets arrested Gonna do some time He got out three years from now Just to commit more crime A businessman is caught With twenty four kilos He's out on bail, and out of jail And that's the way it goes! Ruuuah!
The law on bankruptcy only allows you to declare bankruptcy under a set of circumstances. If you deliberately make a solvent company an insolvent company then you dont meet those terms. In addition could face fraud charges, if the company obtained loans or has shareholders.
This is what Republicans have long wanted. Big government, intervening in private business to take freedom away from the American people. They want a police state. Big government republicans want no limits to government power, and the limits imposed by the founders are like a cross to these vampires. It makes their skin burn.
At least he was nice enough to make it even more abundantly clear that nothing of value was lost.
Mike Adams is not surprising. He was just trying to follow the model of Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, Breitbart, and so forth. Spewing complete crap, then claiming persecution when he gets called out on it. He knows there's millions to be made on it, he just apparently isn't as good at it as the established paranoia-mongers.
I thought far-right types approved of right-wing dictators?
""Natural News had nearly three million Facebook followers prior to the ban. "" Can we build a spaceship to put these 3 million people on and drop them off on Europa? Not yet?... Damn...
Now if only Twitter would ban the Twit In Chief...
They've learned that mentioning actual right-wing dictators as good is bad for business. Hence the rebranding of all dictators as left-wing. This conveniently leads to the conclusion that the more right-wing someone is, the less dictatorial they are, and the less anyone needs to pay attention to how dictatorial those right-wingers actually act. Goebbels has nothing on these people.
Can you clarify the headline, please? It could be read to imply he was banned for the slam on Zuckerberg, though from the story it sounds like that happened as a consequence of being banned,

So if they had stuck to the fake health stuff (ie, not entered the political news/conspiracy arena), would Facebook have left them alone? Because Goop seems to be just scientifically accurate, but going strong. Last edited by nehinks on Mon Jun 10, 2019 12:29 pm
Dude describes tech companies as fascists, while calling for the US government to use military police to force private companies into compliance. The irony is lost on them... (i know that we're all getting sloppy with saying fascism and it's a bit pedantic to say this at this point, but fascism is not the same as simple authoritarianism, and vice versa. Mussolini and Hitler were fascists. Stalin and Mao were not. Grouping them all together as ""fascists"" is not right; all might have been authoritarians and/or statists and wanted in practice absolute power, but the mechanisms and philosophies behind them were different.)

Good. So when are they banning Goop?
""These tech guys are Nazis! President, send in your military police to make them spread our ridiculous propaganda!"" Are these people for real?
Lol, I’ve never felt so confident sizing someone up so quickly before. Five words into one quote, I feel like I know everything I need to know about him. Including that he should’ve been removed a while ago.
It's been an AM radio trope for decades. There's good money to be made doing it. When you have to create that much content daily basis the only place to go is crazy town.
I'm sure any other day he considers the government public enemy one. But since today it benefits him to ask the government to regulate someone else's business in order to save him the expense of building his own platform, he's happy to go along with that. Mikey, free speech doesn't work like that. No one is obligated to build your soapbox for you in order for you to utilize your rights.
This is a good point. I initially had the same thought.
Have you noticed that right wing folks really hate it when businesses make a decision to not associate with someone, despite all of their claims to the contrary?
Only when convenient. Hitler is everyone's favorite demonization trope except for the neo-fascists who practically worship him instead.
Aww, what a shame. He sounds like a nice guy and an important voice in the marketplace of ideas. (/s ....c'mon) EDIT: Also, if only Facebook had decided to clean house back in 2010 or 2012, before it was politically expedient for them do so, maybe I'd be a little less cynical about their intentions. It was pretty clear even by then the site was getting overrun with bile and that was about the time even my teenage self was turned off from taking part in that black hole of toxic politics.

For the sake of my own sanity I'd like to think that a good chunk of those were bots. And why contaminate a pristine alien environment? Probably better to Just drop em directly into the Jovian gravity well and call it a day.
Yes. These are people who have probably never touched a dictionary, hence why propaganda works so well on them, as definitions of words are very malleable.
As an old (enough) fogey who knows that reference, I salute you, sir!
White supremacists have always considered the government their enemy, except when they control it. One of the biggest reason for secession in 1860 was that they knew Lincoln wouldn’t enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, which was supposed to compel free states to help return escaped slaves. Until then they were just fine having a Congress that could force its will on the states. They only cry things like “free speech” and “states’ rights” when they aren’t the ones pulling the levers of government action.
""Toxic vaccines"" are obviously bad. Erm, I wonder where you find those. Actual, real, vaccines, as administered by doctors and health clinics are very good!
They'd probably pollute that as well ... then return peddling metallic hydrogen as a cure for cancer, homosexuality and liberalism ...
So, Facebook was just swell to host his nonsense until they removed him and because of that they magically transformed into a 'smear campaign'. Full disclosure: I have never been on Facebook, have never perused it's content and have No desire to change that fact. The FREEZE PEACH!!! shills will descend upon this article like locusts.

Will the folks hollering 'fascism' ever realize that the first amendment only applies to the government's treatment of speech? Tech companies (or platforms) can publish what they please, and I applaud their late turnaround on the subject of conspiracies and such.

Trump has broken the EULA/TOS of Twitter so many times, but it doesn't matter to them. He can bully private citizens, threaten people and government employees, agitate our enemies and allies and threaten trade wars, but Twitter loves it since he bring them buku bucks. Don't you dare say something mean about someone else, though. You don't bring them enough clicks to warrant keeping on their platform.
Well, they're copying his model but with outlets that Goebbels could only dream of having.
Facebook, you should hang your head in shame. I mean, being beaten to the punch by this motley crew is pretty damn embarrassing.
China. You find them in China. https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/23/asia/fau ... index.html
War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength.
Surely you meant scientifically inaccurate?
Sure, as long as they get to control it. Lose that control and suddenly they’re holding “Tenth Amendment rallies” like they did in 2009. Expect that again the next time they stop controlling the Senate and White House, if not worse.
Is there a money trail for this? If there is one, that might be the only good way to attack these sort of folks. If it's ideological, I have no idea.
This trending anti-science movement scares me more than just about anything else right now.
The decline and fall of America, part 37, Stupidity self-headshot, chapter 6 : The antivaccine movement. It's times like these where I regret my wish to live history.
Not vaccinating your children is child abuse and neglect, and should be subject to criminal charges for doing so.
If you're uncritically following a charismatic speaker, isn't some of that on you?
If there is a hell,Wakefield will be burning in it after he dies.
At the very least, couldn't this be construed as malicious mischief? These people are obviously intending harm to others through the spread of disinformation and outright falsehoods. Some of that harm will lead to death and permanent medical issues. Isn't doing that illegal in some fashion or another?
We're well past the point where vaccination should be mandatory, no exceptions except actual medical ones. If that means breaking down doors and holding people down, I'm fine with that. These people should be arrested and have their children taken away.
If all the anti vaxxers congregate unprotected, won't this problem solve itself? The trick is to not let them out of the Symposium.
Del Bigtree? Lying for his bottom line, public health be damned? Same as ever, disgusting as his conduct is.
So is he saying we shouldn't force children to get vaccines to increase herd immunity because a small percentage of them could have fatal reactions to the vaccine? But it's ok for un-vaccinated kids who would not have that reaction to the vaccine to die from measles? Last edited by hel1kx on Thu Jun 06, 2019 4:57 pm
And they freak out even more about freedoms when a state or city impose any kind of public restriction for people who are not vaccinated in the middle of an outbreak. Spoiler: show
Before long, we'll be sacrificing children to appease weather gods for bountiful harvests. And when that doesn't work, we'll just sacrifice more children... Last edited by dorkbert on Thu Jun 06, 2019 4:58 pm
I'm seriously beginning to think that pursuing manslaughter charges against these assholes isn't a bad idea.
You are too forgiving.
Beth Mole, great article. Serious request: what would you think about referring to this ideology and its proponents, in these articles, as ""pro-plague"" rather than ""anti-vaccination?""
Even if it's illegal, what are you going to do about it? If you arrest them they will become martyrs. I understand the desire for vindication and retribution against the monsters who run the anti-vax movement, but you can't just imprison them without making their claims appear more credible in the minds of their followers.
I disagree. It's ""fire!"" in a theater. Explaining the fact that a stampede in said theater would kill or injure many comes too late, and we see the same here, where we have outbreaks. Last edited by Tom Brokaw on Thu Jun 06, 2019 5:03 pm
Like NIMBY but for kids. They’re fine with everyone else getting vaccinations so they don’t have to. They’d be fine if the whole world burned so long as their kid didn’t have a slight risk of an adverse reaction. And they... want everyone else to have the same option. Which increases the risk of their child dying horribly. Obviously, they aren’t capable of rational thought, but if you don’t think too hard, it makes sense.
Maybe this should be considered the equivalent of yelling ""fire!"" in a crowded theater...
""We could nuke the building from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.""
Its part of a greater collective I like to refer to as the ""Anti-enlightenment movement"". This put with flat earthers, faith healing, and most things that Gwyneth Paltrow espouse as part of her quackery.
Anti-science has been a thing for decades now. It's mostly been confined to the religious right, but it's spreading to other demographics now.
Some. But not enough to make up for the damage that them having any sort of audience causes.
That would just hurt the children. The actual, correct solution we should legitimately pursue is taking the children from the parents for neglect, then fining the parents for their care, plus damages.
We need to work on vaccines against misinformation: meme-immunization
We've got that. It's called ""education."" Honestly, I think it's time we consider doing away with social media. It doesn't serve any useful purpose, and grossly amplifies bullshit.
Unlike their unvaccinated children, the anti-vaxxers have parents with non-zero intelligence and are therefore vaccinated.
As terrible as it is, social media amplifies everything. Imagine where movements like MeToo and BlackLivesMatter would be in a world without social media to amplify their message. The trick is that social media companies need to do a better job managing their platforms. If I went to a bar that hosts open mic nights, and I stapled up a bunch of bullshit flyers on the wall, you can bet the owner would throw me out and take down all my flyers, while loudly proclaiming to their patrons that they have nothing to do with me or any of my bullshit. Why we don't see the same from social media companies is beyond me. Oh right, we do (a little), and every time it happens, faux conservatives cry about being ""deplatformed"".
A lot of kids (and immuno-compromised adults) are going to die (or at least be maimed) before these people lose their grip. I'm still convinced, based on the communities being targeted, that the goal is ethnic cleansing. A few rabbis have been conned into being useful idiots, but the people driving the movement are targeting specific ethnic groups. I don't think that's a coincidence.
I do. Make it a federal crime to spread false information about proven public health programs. That's for starters. The right to free speech doesn't include saying things which demonstrably threaten, harm or endanger others. The antivaxxers bullshit does all three. They're being threatened by the lie that vaccines are harmful. Children are being harmed by delaying or denying their vaccinations. And that endangers the entire public. There's a difference between anecdote and misrepresentation. If the anecdote is supporting misrepresentation of a fact, then that should be a criminal offense. And spreading outright lies that end up inflicting harm on people, AND the public, should be outlawed. This isn't a personal rights thing. It's threatening the public's health. Declare a public health emergency. Then issue an order to quarantine these people indefinitely, and include in that quarantine any outside communications not passed through public health channels, since those are the vectors for this ""disease"" to spread. They can have the quarantine lifted at any time they repudiate their views, vaccinate their kids and have had time for the vaccination to take effect. If they fail to live up to their repudiation, they go into quarantine for life, with all communications screened for evidence of trying to spread the disease before being passed on. It won't stop the problem. But it would likely make people think twice about being so monumentally retarded about their kids health. That ALONE might do the trick.
Science is so inconvenient. It does not follow any political, philosophical, or religious ideology. The horrible process where falsifiable hypothesises are rigorously tested, data published, independently reproduced and refined. That process does not respect what I want to be true. It does not respect what my cultural traditions hold to be true. It does not respect what the leaders want to be true. It does not respect what my sky daddy told me is true. How can it be trusted when it does not care about what people want? All it cares about is iteratively getting closer and closer to objective trueth. Sadly with how things are today, I have to note that this is sarcasm. Does show how science is under attack from so many angles. Anywhere there is someone who cares more about their ideology than reality. Last edited by idspispopd on Thu Jun 06, 2019 5:34 pm
It used to be I would ask-- 'how old do you think the earth is?' to find out what sort of 'science' I might be dealing with. Now I have to ask about GMOs, climate, vaccines and how many genders the human race includes-- and the list goes on-- flat earth...
In one way, gatherings like this one have the advantage of being a target-rich environment. If the city wants to focus on combating this disinformation, they could send staff to hand out factual literature before and after these events, right outside the entrance, and be prepared to address concerns with truth - including the truth that the organizers of the event are flat-out lying.
I'd be lying if I didn't think that you meant ""target-rich environment"" as a method to spread contagion...
Trump doesn't give two shits about the issue. Trump cares about one thing only: Trump. He was convinced to do it by the religious right as another bone for the base.
So the ProBirth lobby is placated as we toss an ENTIRE research domain for important progress against serious diseases to off-shore companies who will own the market. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
100% a play to impress his base. It'll work of course. Another reason why your vote matters Edit: Ninja'ed
In one of life’s little ironies, my sweet, naive Dad — who’s been on a slow mental decline due to early stage Alzheimer’s — voted for Agent Orange in 2016. So basically, he voted for the thing that has now cut off research into the disease that will eventually kill him.
The same folks are very pro-HIV, so I don't think they're gonna care about ending anti-HIV research.
Clearly Trump is afraid researchers will discover he’s not a real boy.
Can you clarify your comment? “Pro-HIV” how? As in they hope it will kill all of us homos?
I'm sure trump dosen't give a rat's ass about the morals of this issue, it just buys him votes. This of course dosen't seem to matter to the constituients he's targeting. Who vote on one issue alone, ignoring all the pain & suffereing his other polices inflict, even upon themselves.
They only care until the moment you're born. Then f you, you're on your own.
Not ninja'd. This needs to be repeated ad nauseam (and Trump is nauseam supremis). His core is going to vote for him no matter what he does. It's up to the Rest of Us.
Well it looks like Trump is playing to the Christian Right again. Just like GW Bush all over again.
Oh don't say that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUspLVStPbk
It's amazing how we continue to let the most uneducated segment of this damn country drive decision making, led by none other than King Dumbass at the top of the hill.
Precisely so. The religious right is why Reagan chose not to address HIV during his presidency and have shaped HIV policy for subsequent Republican adminstrations in the same way, for the same reason.
You haven't been paying attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Exf302XvUM He was part of the foot-dragging Reagan-era response to the AIDS crisis.

Until you turn 18, then you can be sent halfway around the world to be a target.
They don't even care that long. As long as the fetus can be put on life support, they're good. Survivability or viability, like the health of the mother, is of no concern to them.
Yes.
But not their spawn. Send the brown people.
News Flash! Trump stops progress in research to fire up his base. In other news, water is wet.
I think the headline should say Pence cancels it, Trump wouldn't care other than throwing a bone to a certain segment of the GOP base (the part least likely to support him otherwise).
The only human dignity this president and administration cares about is that of white male hetero religious people. Well, really just rich people who fit those criteria, but you have to make some play at the poors to keep them behind you. Last edited by Zagen30 on Thu Jun 06, 2019 1:50 pm
And the cycle continues. Next Democrat to take office will overturn this just like Slick Willy did and I applaud them when it happens.
“We believe this decision to be politically motivated, shortsighted, and not based on sound science,”.... Well, at least this decision is consistent with his other decisions.
This is him flailing trying to draw the attention of his base to distract from current topics. This is concerning, but can be fixed. Its when he starts full blow wars to distract that we should be seriously concerned.
I wonder how many abortions Trump has paid for.
I was seriously concerned on election night and my serious concern has not ebbed since. Waiting until he starts a shooting war is a little too late, n'est-pas?
The fruits of that research should be denied to these asshole. Oh, you have horrible disease X? Sorry, the cure is based on fetal cell research, so none for you. Enjoy!
Whatever it is I'm sure he can't count that high even using his fingers.
“We believe this decision to be politically motivated, shortsighted, and not based on sound science,” Pretty much every decision made by this administration. Also it's such a complete waste of viable research tissue, it's not like they are forcing women to have abortions against their will to obtain it although I am sure some anti-abortion people say so. The fetus is already removed and dead, why not let it help humanity in the process so not only the woman's life improved by not having an unwanted baby but humanity as a whole?
Trump pay? More like get that abortion or I'll sue you!

Precisely. The Soviet disinformation campaign Operation INFEKTION was to promote the conspiracy theory that the US Government has created HIV at Fort Detrick, and it was subsequently released by the CIA to target gays and Black revolutionaries. And as always, alt-right believed KGB over the US agencies.
A not-insignificant number of religious people believe that HIV was sent from the heavens by God to kill all them gays yeah....
It doesn't matter to his fans. He is a rich white man who hates the right people. That means be is superior, favored by God, and must be forgiven.

Watching the callous indifference of Saint Ronnie as the epidemic spread while the smiling asshole did NOTHING. Watching evil, satanic bastards like Pat Buchanan spreading their poisonous rhetoric across the airwaves. (OK I take that back; there ARE some people who deserve to suffer.)

You know what else causes cancer? Living on Earth. You have a chance of developing cancer from natural background radiation. Maybe Prop 65 stickers should actually be affixed to the foreheads of newborns. Basically everything causes cancer if you give enough of it to a rat.
Repeal that asinine nanny state law already. All it does is enrich grifters like these.
Well, that does it! No more triple espresso shots in my morning prune juice.
Nice digging and great article. I think this Prof. Smith should be subject to a more thorough investigation concerning his conflicts of interest. On a broader note, the effects of putting unwarranted warning labels all over the place is pernicious: not only does it make people ignore them, but it also gives fodder for those who are actually pushing harmful stuff (e.g. cigarette makers) because they can point at harmless things like coffee and say ""you see, that also causes cancer"".
Breathing oxygen (hence Reactive Oxygen Species) is probably more dangerous than background radiation. It really shouldn't be allowed.
It's California. What can you do? *shrugs* Edit: I am not a Californian, nor do I identify as one. I recognize that it is a different state and they do things differently there from where I live. I am not a fan of Proposition 65, but it does not affect me. If it affects you and you don't like it, you have my sympathies. Last edited by Mr Bigglesworth on Thu Jun 06, 2019 12:21 pm

Don't despair! There's lots of quinoa and kale juice. And there's all kinds of organic smoothie shops where you can buy blueberry-cauliflower-cucumber-arugula smoothies for $19.00.

Why does CERT even receive a payout at all from these lawsuits? What standing do they have that gives them grounds to sue? Don’t they have to show actual harm? These potential violations of the law seem like something the state’s health and safety department should be investigating, not something an obscure and potentially shady non-profit should be litigating in court.
As a lawyer representing smaller companies in the food and beverage space, I have seen numerous prop 65 complaints against my clients and can tell you that the average settlement amount that I see is being split 10-20:1 lawyer to plaintiff. The plaintiff is just a prop for them to be able to make a lucrative career out of ambulance chasing for these ridiculous lawsuits. So Metzger is probably the one making off here, as he would be able to charge excessively high hourly fees to CERT for each case notwithstanding the non-profit status.
The statute (and quite a few FDA rules as well) specifies a private enforcement right. The applicable regulatory agency does not have the time or money to enforce the laws in all of the hundreds to thousands of new products launched every day, so they expressly allow private individuals to bring a suit to enforce it, otherwise it would have no teeth. Standing is simply that the plaintiff purchased the potentially cancer-causing product but would not have done so if the required warnings were present. (Not saying I agree with any of this, just answering your questions.)
so its basically like a patent troll(tech wise) type of company,org wth it want or needs it to be to get the money
I always chuckle when I arrive in California. Just walking off the plane into the jet way apparently causes cancer according to the Prop 65 sign there.

These potential violations of the law seem like something the state’s health and safety department should be investigating, not something an obscure and potentially shady non-profit should be litigating in court. What else could you expect form California. I think that all the founders of this organization should be thoroughly investigated. Then to stop all this repeal the law.
Seems like a query to the UC Berkeley Office of Ethics might be in order?
Not to dredge up another thread from earlier in the week, but this is a good example of why labeling isn't necessarily a benign good-for-everyone's interest endeavor. ""What's the harm in labeling something to make the customer more informed?"" This is. It means you are told your morning coffee, the new bed frame you purchased, and the sun screen you use to prevent melanoma are all going to give you cancer. Don't take this is as the opposite stance, never label anything. Just that even the best of intentions can cause some pretty big problems
As an environmentalist in industry, these prop 65 warnings are complete FUD. I have done environmental work in California, and while they have one of the most challenging toxics programs in the nation, it has some reasonable basis in science, at least Prop 65, in contrast, is complete fearmongering; it may as well be junk science. I wonder if it was even well-intentioned. Toxicity is so much more than ""is it there or not in any molecular amount,"" and I've seen so much backlash by the average Joe Public to the ridiculousness that is Prop 65, that I seriously worry that it's damaging good science and good policy by proxy.
The intent of the law seems perfectly sound: warn people if they're going to consume something that could cause cancer. But it gets stretched out of all credibility by allowing marginal evidence based on grossly unrealistic concentrations introduced into test animals. The right way to fix this seems to me to be to change the law so that the requirement for cancer warning labels applies to products where evidence exists for a significantly increased risk of cancer at studies corresponding to the maximum recommended daily intake. Perhaps require producers to state a maximum recommended daily usage or perhaps have a study to allocate maxima by product category in terms of portions per day. And make it so the evidence has to be peer reviewed and independently reproduced. That would seem to pass the idiot check: cigarettes, say a reasonable maximum of 20 per day? Yup, causes cancer. Coffee, reasonable maximum of 15 cups per day? No credible evidence for that, no warning required.
I would hold out much hope there given that it is it is in the area of Berkeley which is ground zero for something as equally stupid as prop 65, Berkeley Cell Phone ""Right to Know"" Ordinance. This is why you need to keep local government on a tight leash and given it a good pull of the choker chain when they pass stupid laws like Prop 65 and Berkeley Cell Phone ""Right to Know"" Ordinance.
So are they ever gonna remove the warnings over acrylamide in other products, AKA literally every piece of food that is baked, fried, or grilled?
So a different form of economic or political systems would change this?
You slipping Beth, that would have been ripe for a the pun ""brewhaha"" instead. (EDIT: Somebody beat me to it) Leave it to lawyers to come up with new ways to troll for money. We had patent trolls and now, we have.. what kind of troll would you call this? Food troll, cancer troll, cancer causing agents troll? Last edited by Rabbiddog on Thu Jun 06, 2019 7:19 am

One of my favorite pieces of trivia is that sleeping next to another person gives you a very very small dose of radiation. And as we all know, radiation can cause cancer. I've asked my spouse to affix a prop 65 warning to her head and she refused for some reason. I'm sure if I keep asking it will result in reproductive harm. Snark aside, prop 65 has ceased being useful and will only condition people to ignore the warning. Then when something actually dangerous comes out, no one will notice. They will equate the same harm from coffee as they will from cigarettes, which does not serve the public health in the least.
So you're just going to assume that UCB won't care, because, hey, it's California? That's not helpful. I know nothing about their track record on ethics investigations, but here's a story about how their Chancellor had to resign after they investigated him for a fairly weak-sauce violation of policy. So it's worth a try.
I for one cannot think of better morning than sitting next to my irradiating partner, drinking a hot cup of acrylamide coffee and smoking a cancer-combustion cigarette.
Living is the single greatest cause of cancer, and the longer you live the bigger the risk.
Non-California resident here, so I don't have first-hand experience. However, why not have a scale of 0-10? (or a larger number if greater precision is needed) For instance, something like coffee, which has in small amounts a possible cancer-causing material, but the science isn't 100%, could be a 1. Something that is known with a high probability to cause cancer with chronic exposure, like cigarettes could be a 9. Something that is known with a high probability with acute exposure, like asbestos, could be a 10. Wouldn't that make more sense than just a simple yes/no?
Maybe somebody could reach out to their student newspaper or something? Seems like a professor making money as an expert witness for lawsuits that his organization launched is a pretty scandalous thing. Wouldn't be surprised to find that the witness fee was vastly overinflated, too. This sort of thing ought to get him kicked out of UC Berkeley, but they're kind of a mess right now.
You know what else causes cancer - living long enough. Absent of other causes eventually our DNA replication machinery kicks out an error that causes a fatal cancer. Natural selection does little to protect us from cancer because it tends to kill us after we have reproduced and protected our offspring until self sufficiency.

i thought i read about this a while back, but that incident was in 2010 in australia (same parasite) and he died in november 2018: https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2 ... -hes-dead/
In Australia there was an unfortunate case of a young guy who swallowed a slug on a dare, contracted rat lungworm, got encephalitis, fell into a coma, and was brain damaged for the last eight years of his life. http://time.com/5445715/australia-slug- ... 3famp=true There are never circumstances when eating slugs or snails are a good idea. I don't care what the French say 🐌
Suddenly makes the spam sound more appetizing.
After you've turned it up to 11.
So of the 3 latest cases, one ate a lot of homemade salads, another was foraging off of plants without washing and the third ate a semi-slug on a dare. I think the last one should have his medical insurance costs hiked. --edited for grammars-- Last edited by tomca13 on Thu May 30, 2019 4:31 pm

It took me until the middle of the fourth graf: Quote: Young worms leave the nest early to find their own windy homes, though. Larvae get coughed up into rats’ throats then swallowed.

Hey. We do cook the snails, you know. We ain’t a buncha dumb Youtubers.
Check out the graph on page 6 here, it shows number of cases per island, through 2017: https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/files/20 ... 032218.pdf Bottom line is that the Big Island gets the vast majority of cases, but the parasite is present on all islands. Kauai has had a few cases over the years. This particular cluster accounted for a fair number of the cases: ""In mid-2017, a cluster of cases on Hawaii Island was exposed to the disease from drinking homemade kava that was left out overnight in an uncovered container. Six adults drank the kava and found a slug at the bottom of the bowl. All six adults were hospitalized—three individuals had confirmed positive laboratory tests, and three individuals were considered probable cases based on their shared exposure as well as consistent clinical and laboratory findings. "" So in general the cases are still pretty rare, especially outside of the Big Island. It's probably safe to say that more people have been killed or seriously injured by shark attacks, which are also rare enough that I don't lose any sleep about them.

So, are escargot OK, or not? Is this something that can be and is screened for in the food supply? If not, is cooking a reliable way to kill it?
Go outside they said... see the world they said... Nope, that's OK.
Except that in this case, the clear majority of semi-slugs have the parasite: ""Studies have shown that when compared with other slug and snail species found locally in Hawaii, the semi-slug had the highest prevalence of infection of A. cantonensis, with 68 percent of all specimens collected testing positive for the parasite."" Source: https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/files/20 ... 032218.pdf So for this species at least, you really don't want to take the chance of eating even a single one. If you really want to eat snails in Hawaii, I suggest trying opihi. Last edited by Zomboe on Thu May 30, 2019 4:50 pm

Let's all stop referring to the Sackler's as the Sackler family. They should be referred to as the Sackler Cartel.
Evidently big pharma does, in point of fact, own the organizations we were supposed to trust. They bought doctors, senators, representatives, governors, regulators, and now, apparently, one of the most-trusted worldwide NGOs. Christ, Pablo Escobar and Miguel Gallardo wish they could have this kind of power and influence. What's next? ""Sackler family secretly profited from brokering heroin imports for drug dealers""?

For pennies on the dollar, too. What do you think the biggest bribe they handed was? Maybe 100 grand lump sum, perhaps a vacation home for 200,000? Meanwhile they made billions destroying West Virginia and many other rural communities worldwide.

Billions of dollars pays for a lot of legal representation. It's possible to build insane layers of protection around oneself with enough lawyers. There was a fascinating story in the NYTimes Magazine about a couple involved in a divorce where the husband was trying to hide $400 million in assets from her. The same techniques used to hide money from governments was being used against her, plus a few more things. Imagine how much harder it would be if he had billions to hide/spend.
The association I had with the company for years was to Purdue University. I imagine that's what they wanted me to think.
There's a very wide middle ground. Besides, the US government is 20% of the US economy. How it spends money has an enormous effect on the rest of it.
These large Pharma companies are now nothing more than International Criminal Enterprises. They prey on their customers, perform dangerous undisclosed human trials in the poorest countries in the world, and rain riches down upon their Political Whores and Legal Shields to keep prying eyes away from their bloody deeds and financial largess. They raise prices on a whim with impunity having captured or neutered any and all regulatory entities years ago.
While the French revolution led to what is possibly the worst dictatorship in France over the last 1000 years (a time period aptly named ""The Terror""), I also believe that it laid the groundwork for a national identity strongly tied to burning shit in the streets when things fail, and in turn a government and social elite actually afraid of the general population. Maybe the US needs something similar. It's fucking unbelievable what rich people can get away with in the US.
Flay them alive.
It's like a shitty Bond movie.
They'd never do that: what's the point of running legal risks to help your competitors in the opiate market move their product when you could instead just ship your own, not share a cut of the take with the competition; and incur significantly lower legal exposure? When you've achieved the darkly impressive feat of effectively building a heroin cartel that manages to look like a pharmaceutical company for regulatory and supply chain purposes there's pretty much nothing to be gained by slumming with the losers who still depend on a dysfunctional supply chain and a logistical system sapped by the need for stealth.
If there's a more evil family alive in America I sure don't know about them. The Sacklers won't suffer any actual consequences, of course, we reserve those for black dudes caught selling cigarettes or driving to work.
I favor public floggings, myself. Hangings are over way too fast. For people who have harmed others and are indifferent to the harm they caused, yeah, adult corporal punishment seems somehow appropriate. THEN throw them in jail. Maybe seeing someone in their line of work getting flogged will deter others from it, but I expect like most people, they don't think they'll get caught.
Jesus, that is grim.
Holy...****ing...Shit......the company needs to be order to be liquidated with the sales going towards Non-Profits that help Opioid Addicts Recover. Then the heads of the company should be jailed for life without parole. This was not just flooding the market or hiring a huge lobbyist firm or even getting an ex board member elected to Congress. They positioned people loyal to them into the WHO to spy and manipulate under the guise of neutrality. This could have delayed the WHO response to the opiods and led to even more deaths beyond any of the above methods. I must also say thank you to Purdue. Thank you for proving just how UNREGULATED your industry is. That you felt so comfortable with how few eyes in Washington were watching you, that you actively created a Conspiracy to Defraud the Public, Defraud the U.S. Government, ""potentially"" Kill an undetermined number of Americans, Drive up the Sales of Opioids using Lies they crafted using their own internally created data which actually showed strong warnings towards addiction, They targeted the most vulnerable people in the country, the sick and dying in PAIN, and lied to doctors about the addictive properties, except for the doctors who decided to help them and they created their own criminal enterprises (there are stories about doctors over prescribing by over 1000% compared to other doctors in the area), they made Doctors instruments of pain and death using a PAINKILLER FFS!!!! These are EVIL fucking people. If you say there is nothing evil about maximizing their profit...you are a Sociopath.
For $20 million, we could put a guillotine in pretty much every town square in the country...

Nope. Guillotine was intended as a painless execution method. The shitty thing is that there are tons of valid uses for hard painkillers, even those with addictive effects. Like for terminal illness pain management. There was absolutely no reason to push Oxycontin as appropriate in less extreme conditions. Aside from just pure greed. As in making xB$ over x100M$. This is really a test case for personal criminal liability. Purdue Corp should get dissolved. But that serves for nothing if some of the key decision makers don’t go to jail. Corporations as legal persons serve several important purposes, such as joint ownership and easing continuity when a founder dies. But that principle should not shield deciders from liability in at least some criminal cases. Mainly those where a conscious decision was made to put lives at risk. This is where I regret being non-religious: I hope they burn in hell. Edit: add my personal contempt for the fundraisers of all the worthy museums and institutions that accepted their tainted $ in the last 5 or so years. Now there is stampede to distance themselves. And 10 years or so ago, it wasn’t obvious what these evil people were up to. But for the last 5? Blood money donations to fund respectability. Last edited by Triarius on Thu May 23, 2019 4:05 pm

The whole idea that there is a fetal heartbeat at 6 weeks is a deliberate lie by anti-abortion groups. There isn't even a heart at 6 weeks, and the ""fetus"" is actually an embryo about 1 cm in size. It is absolutely not viable, so treating the embryo as a person is very, very misleading. https://www.livescience.com/65501-fetal ... ained.html
Hopefully, none of the ads are crafted carefully enough to skirt around false advertising laws.   I may have run across some topical ammo for that
This is definitely good, and a step in the right direction. However these ""pregnancy crisis centers"" who pretend to help women's health will seat themselves next door to actual clinics to confuse every person they can. We need the law to dictate legal advertising regulations especially for medical procedures, but I'm also not lost on the fact that it's probably not going to happen like that.
I am Catholic and opposed to abortion. I don’t see how anyone could object to Google’s actions here. “provides abortions” and “doesn’t provide abortions” is a factual, informative, and neutral piece of information that prevents deception.
To put it into perspective, frogs have more of a brain than a fetus at 6 weeks.
I too am opposed morally to abortion, but would never support any form of lying or deception or law to keep a woman from doing it.
Frogs have more of a brain than Trump at 6 weeks.
I’m not taking issue with your point about “fetal heartbeat”, but whether or not a human zygote, or an embryo or a fetus is a person at any stage in its development is a person depends totally on how you define person and that’s actually where the disagreement lies.
As a person who holds that position how do you feel, or have you had any conversations with individuals who agree with you about the deception employed by these groups to achieve that end? Its easy enough to agree, or disagree with change, but harder to describe a nuanced view of the current state of affairs for many IMO
would also really like to see a similar annotation on vaccine/anti-vaxx stuff that is ""isn't idiotic"" vs ""is idiotic"". i'm not sure if i'm joking.
Filtering out ads that are not relevant to the search parameters seems like a totally sensible practice. Now if someone wants to search for ""sanctimonious hypocrites invading everybody else's business"" then, sure, these busybody propaganda centers are an appropriate result.
I was about to post this same article. But prior to someone pointing this out, I actually believed there was a fetal heartbeat because that is the phrase the politicians have been using. Now it know at 6 weeks it is still an embryo, there is no heart, and you can't ""hear"" the heart beat.
Quote: ""I’m not taking issue with your point about “fetal heartbeat”, but whether or not a human zygote, or an embryo or a fetus is a person at any stage in its development is a person depends totally on how you define person and that’s actually where the disagreement lies."" In the case of abortion, a vocal minority of people are attempting to make that definition for a woman, based on religious beliefs. Even worse, the people passing these fetal heartbeat laws are almost entirely men...I guess women aren't considered to be smart enough to decide what to do with their own bodies. I sincerely doubt that you would be as supportive of such an approach if a government made up primarily of women made an equivalent decision, such as forced vasectomies. Walk a mile in their shoes, sir.
Sadly, the disagreement has nothing to do with any of that. An abortion may be medically necessary at any point during a pregnancy. It unfortunately doesn't matter whether there's a heartbeat or not; in those cases, failure to remove the fetus will seriously injure or kill the woman carrying it. One of the legislators responsible for the Alabama bill made it quite clear (even if he did it accidentally): frozen embryos aren't covered by the bill, because this isn't about the embryos, or the blastocysts, or the fetuses. It's about the women.
So, lying isn't a sin. Oooooookay then.
I have been up to now completely unaware of such things. I know of a single local pregnancy crisis clinic that member of my parish donate to, but I have no knowledge of them engaging in deceptive advertising. I hope they haven’t. I think it’s reasonable to purchase ads that target women possibly interested in abortion that say “Thinking of an abortion? Contact us for alternatives” and the like, but making women think you offer abortion until you get get then face to face and start applying used-car dealer tactics is not right.
Or you can look at the history of the hotbutton topic. Evangelicals used to stay out of politics... until politicians were able to convince them to participate to support segregation. After that defeat, political strategists literally sat around trying to think of how to keep this new voter base engaged. They came up with ""abortion"". If you go back to the Southern Baptist Convention (extremely conservative) back in the 1970s, they resolved that abortion under certain conditions, namely rape, incest, and severe fetal deformity should be permitted. Today, we see the result of political strategists (complete opposition... because common ground doesn't generate the hate and vehemence that occurs in diametric opposition which gets people to the voting booths)... and people think they've come to these conclusions themselves.
This is absolutely true. These bills are meant to subjugate women, end of story. Those sponsoring them are threatened by women who can make their own choices. It's really just that simple.
Some people do some mental gymnastics to say that lying to help yourself is a sin, but lying to aid others is not.
Wow, it took 22 minutes before that showed up. I'm impressed.
Sins are for other people. That's what self-righteous means. Think about it. Anyone who has means and needs an abortion can always fly over to a blue state to get one. They can do it quickly and quietly, before anybody notices. Unless the federal government gets in on the abortion banning, and with Democrats in control of the House, that's damn unlikely. So from the perspective of the more affluent, this is banning abortions for poor/black/etc people, not themselves. Last edited by Alfonse on Wed May 22, 2019 5:13 pm
They were made aware of deceptive advertising practices and they took steps to address it. They didn't even call out the shady advertiser or ban them. How is this in any way targeting a political foe? If you have political beliefs and espouse them in a way that violates either the law or TOS, your actions aren't somehow exempt!
The US is #55 in terms of infant mortality according to the US government. As soon as the anti-abortion crowd can explain how they're working to fix that dismal, pathetic number, I'll start believing that they actually think abortion = murder. Until then, it's just another excuse for Puritanism and controlling women. Last edited by Reaperman2 on Wed May 22, 2019 5:15 pm
I've been watching this guy a bit for the past while... good information here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgGpFYEMiw0
Look up Tim Murphy. Pennsylvania Rep. Tim Murphy has resigned after a report surfaced earlier this week that he had asked an extramarital lover to end her pregnancy. Murphy, a Republican who co-sponsored a 20-week abortion ban that passed in the House Tuesday, allegedly asked his lover to terminate her pregnancy, according to text message records acquired by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/anti-ab ... d=50274843 They're all pro-life till it's their side piece that's pregnant.
How so? Google is a private company Their policies state that ads can't be misleading or false. This isn't a question of politics. It's a question of accuracy of information and adhering to the stated policies of the ad delivery company. Vetting ads for their intentions, then displaying those intentions on the ad, is one way to ensure the public remains informed. Moreover, Google's only ""issue"" may be market dominance, but it's taking ads from BOTH SIDES here and ensuring that they are accurate. It's not unilateral against either side. Had it been, the market dominance thing might have become an issue. I don't see that as an issue here, because it's not a matter of political favoritism. It may well be the way of the future, with Google enforcing a passive ""truth in advertising"" policy across the board (especially if they have any blowback based on market dominance). That way, they're treating EVERYONE alike, and not picking favorites, so dominance won't be that much of a factor. It'll be catastrophic to the conservative agenda to have their ads showing what they MEANT based on Google's vetting, but liberals have gone down lie-lie lane, too. Not to mention corporations with their bullshit ads. Call me a hopeless idealist, but I'd love to see ads that have what they really mean in bold letters (or even in small ones) laying over the lies.
In my experience, most protestants, especially the Southern Baptists and their like, have very little fixed theology and are very adaptable in how they interpret their infallible bible. Asking for a firm theological justification of their beliefs for any but the most basic facts of the Christian religion is usually futile.

It is absolutely not viable, so treating the embryo as a person is very, very misleading. I’m not taking issue with your point about “fetal heartbeat”, but whether or not a human zygote, or an embryo or a fetus is a person at any stage in its development is a person depends totally on how you define person and that’s actually where the disagreement lies. Sadly, the disagreement has nothing to do with any of that. An abortion may be medically necessary at any point during a pregnancy. It unfortunately doesn't matter whether there's a heartbeat or not; in those cases, failure to remove the fetus will seriously injure or kill the woman carrying it. One of the legislators responsible for the Alabama bill made it quite clear (even if he did it accidentally): frozen embryos aren't covered by the bill, because this isn't about the embryos, or the blastocysts, or the fetuses. It's about the women. I am not willing to get into an unproductive abortion debate here, so my last comment on the article is this: If the as-yet-unborn child is a human person with all the rights that entails, it is not a simple decision to terminate that person’s in favor of the mother. In that case, very nuanced and difficult decisions have to be made. It’s only simple if you disregard the possibility that the unborn child has the same right to life as its mother, and that goes right back to the definition of personhood. For the Catholic Church there are no hard and fast rules on the issue of abortion in medically indicated cases like those. There are some guiding moral principles and hard decisions to be made. As an indication of how things go however, the termination of tubal pregnancies is generally permitted/accepted by the Church. Yes, but what does that mean about the logic of the position? If you believe that the ""as-yet-unborn child"" is indeed ""a human person with all the rights that entails"", then it must always be so. You're not allowed to pick and choose. If you say that it's OK to treat an ""as-yet-unborn child"" like trash if it is fertilized externally, then your position is not logically consistent if you then say that it's bad if it's implanted in a woman. The only way for those two positions to be logically consistent is if the reason for banning abortion is that it's banning a woman from aborting the ""as-yet-unborn child"", not protecting the life of the ""as-yet-unborn child"".

I think the test for ""is the vertebrate embryo even plausibly a viable independent thing"" doesn't even need to be that crazy to have a reasoned debate. If you put it in its ideal fluid, ideal thermal range, tonicity, and fluid oxygenation, then attach an ideal calorie/water feeding tube to its mouth releasing ideal amounts at ideal intervals, can it self-sustain? If it can't (like all those ""fetal heartbeat"" bills), you're not even trying to have a good faith discussion or debate. You're just trying to enforce your own dogma on someone. edit: and to be clear, as a guy, I have no right to make a woman do anything with her own body in the first place, but if the discussion is happening there should be a good faith effort to have a reasonable starting place based in reality.

Had a similar issue in Indonesia 40+ years ago with fake doctors showing up at small villages with “vitamin” shots that were just sugar water. I imagine this kind of thing has been going on for millennia in one form or another.
This snake oil bites back. Poor kids.
Let's switch the subjects but preserve the structure of the argument. ""Not ALL of the town's murdered hookers were found in my shed!"" Brilliant defense, there. Isn't it also the case that in Pakistan there are various militant or fundamentalist groups spreading the rumor that vaccinations are a plot to poison people by the West, or contain haram ingredients or something?
Not in Sindh, thats more of a problem in Jamu and Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The story originated as KGB propaganda in the 80s. They had their agents of influence plant and promote the story to try as disrupt the American backed insurgency in Afghanistan.
Ah yes, because some of the children may have been infected another way, that totally clears him of all charges! /s What an asshole.
There is no way 600 children contracted HIV from sexual abuse. Fuck off with that conspiracy theory bullshit.
Yes. It can actually be incredibly dangerous for actual health workers because of misinformation and militant groups. There have been attacks as recently as April 2019. This kind of quackery is only going to cause further distrust and problems in an area that is already has problems pushing vaccination programs.
Jammu and Kashmir is not even in Pakistan but part of India - a different country entirely .
Rumors like this spread everywhere. Health workers fighting Ebola get attacked due to suspicion of spreading the virus. Or the current measles outbreak in the Philippines is supposedly due to fears after a French pharmaceutical company introduced a dengue fever vaccine without proper guidelines, which may have killed 10 children. Establishing trust is a problem even when you take religion out of the equation.
Sadly, thanks to US, they are semi-right as US used a fake vaccination campaign when tracking down Binladen... They could have at least vaccinated the kids properly while doing it but no.
So I’m not religious at all - but hearing about stuff like this really makes me wish there is a hell after all, with a particular warm and nasty spot reserved for those responsible for something as hideously awful as this.
Healthcare should be a human right.
The Pakistani province of Jammu and Kashmir was formed on the 1949 ceasefire line. Jammu and Kashmir and the Punjab occur as provinces in both India and Pakistan .
Years ago, my college roommate (who was, but no longer is, a libertarian) asked why doctors, lawyers, and accountants had to be licensed. This quackery business is why. Also, there is no way these quacks have pockets deep enough to pay for the lifetime of HIV/AIDS medication their victims will need. Hopefully, the government there or an international aid group steps in.
Right on cue the Russian troll appears
Well, this story is beyond awful. Shattering. Time to go do something cheerful
Is it trolling? I remember reading about it at the time and this article from the Guardian talks about how vaccination was used as a cover for DNA sampling to try and find members of Bin Laden's family. They're hardly a fake news outlet.
He’s not trolling, it’s sadly the truth, causing widespread distrust in vaccination campaigns not just in Pakistan but elsewhere as well. Also has been used as the pretext for attacks on foreign health workers. https://news.nationalgeographic.com/201 ... bin-laden/
Almost by the very definition, it's trolling. It's completely non-contributory. Any and every topic must be served with a side of ""oh by the way, also there's this bad thing that I say the US did"", inevitably derailing the discussion with a heaping helping of destructive whataboutism. I don't even need to examine whether or not grandparent comment's claims are, in fact, technically true. It's still an active and targeted effort to confound productive conversation.
For once, I couldn't enjoy any of bets puns. This news is so effed up, I don't know how to comment. I wasnt aware that hiv was spread by stupid people. Is there an award lower than the ig nobel prize, that you can win, because there are some aspects of humanity, that defy all reason. Kind of reminds me of the Chernobyl disaster cover up, and ignorance of the aftermath. Nevermind how it happened. Three episodes in, best show on TV.
It would be nice if that were Russian trolling, but it's true and has been openly admitted by the US government. Authorizing that was Obama's biggest war crime. All major government leaders end up committing war crimes, but that one really stands out as unforgiveable. And he committed it to strike a target that had no military value any more, just revenge value.
Quackery is the unavoidable consequence of healthcare that is unaffordable by or unavailable to the masses. And the unavoidable consequence of that quackery is public health disasters that will reach even those who can afford and access quality healthcare. We can argue till we're blue in the face regarding whether or not unfettered access to quality healthcare for all is a fundamental human right. But it certainly is sound public health policy.
It's about the problem of individuals in the area trusting medical professionals. And it's not ""whataboutism"" - it's accurately describing an additional problem related to what was discussed in the article. And the fact that you don't care whether or not a criticism of the US is ""technically true"" speaks volumes.
Hint it was real vaccination not a fake one, as stated by the Russian troll
Your reading comprehension is shit. The statement ""I can evaluate the impact of X without knowing if it's true"" is completely unrelated to ""I don't care if X is true"". But anyway, look at that! The conversation has been successfully derailed, just as the grandparent troll intended.
I was really hoping this was a case of ignorance and poor hygiene standards (like the reports of washing needles for reuse alongside soiled laundry that came out about some of the understaffed medical charities operating out of India a few decades ago), but then I saw it mentioned that Ghangharo has AIDS and can't help but think of the story of that dentist that was deliberately trying to infect people. It doesn't change the outcome, but it would at least help my cynicism of humanity if it's at least the former instead of the latter.

The problem is that stuff like this really does contribute to mistrust of vaccination, and while you or I wouldn't use the existence of a covert operation of this sort as a reason to not get vaccinated, these things tend to carry more weight in poorer communities where medicine and education can be lacking.
The guy is a medical charlatan. We ALREADY KNEW he was a major-league asshole.I'm surprised he hasn't fallen back to some ridiculous superstitious nonsense yet.
My single biggest issue with the Obama administration is that they deliberately chose to work under cover of WHO immunizations to gather DNA data to track down Bin Lauden. In other words: the immunizations (though valid immunizations) really were a front in order to hunt down a terrorist leader. What sort of response do we think Al Quedia has? How many will die of preventable disease (or violence) because of a redoubling of distrust and attacks on WHO workers because of this? https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/ ... ladens-dna
So if I mug 10 random people and make off with $2,000 of items and cash, I'm not guilty of mugging 10 people simply because there are other people in the world who were mugged by someone other than me? Where does this logic even come from? Last edited by Dark Pumpkin on Wed May 22, 2019 9:04 am
Hepatitis B vaccination requires 3 shots or it doesn't work and the vaccination team only gave out a single shot and never returned so they didn't vaccinate the population at all. What about that is a lie? Stop trolling and start posting stuff to back up your claims. I'm not blaming all the problems with encouraging vaccine uptake in the developing world on a single operation to catch Bin Laden. There was mistrust about vaccination before it happened and there would still be mistrust even if it had never taken place. The problem is that like the unsafe dengue fever vaccination in the Philippines, these kind of headlines are genuinely damaging when you're trying to vaccinate people, many of whom will not have been educated as to why vaccination is so important and who may have a severe lack of trust in what they see as 'foreign' medicine.

Yes, currently available HepB vaccines require two (or three, depending on which vaccine you go with for infants IIRC) shots to be as effective as we'd like. That does NOT mean a single shot doesn't provide a substantial reduction in risk in its own right. Cute to see how you'll twist and turn to get to your predetermined conclusions, though.
I initially took that he was using that argument to deny the charges of deliberately infecting people. Now, it doesn't seem clear to me what he is denying with this argument. Last edited by jason8957 on Wed May 22, 2019 9:13 am
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is what AxMi wanted. Exactly as Sarty described.
Wow. FDA, this is a very serious blemish on a very tarnished image. WTF? This is totally unconscionable. Do your fucking job! Also, kudos to Kaiser Health researchers.
Is it possible to write a speechless comment? So we are going to require public reporting of incidents to help inform the public. To paraphrase “But the incident reports were on display…” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the incident reports, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.”
The MAUDE for pacemakers is pretty entertaining (although macabre) reading, by the way. Apparently there is a nontrivial number of ER nurses and doctors who don't realize you shouldn't use paddles on a person that has one.
""Amazing"" doesn't quite do justice to the absurdity of this. At best, this is weaponized idiocy; at worst it's criminal with life-threatening consequences. How does something like this remain undiscovered for so long? How do FDA officials, past and present, sleep at night? SAD!
This goes above and beyond the coporation-protectionism you see from some agencies *cough*FCC*cough* This is on a whole new level. 1.1 million secret reports. Yes, there are 300 million people in this country, but these aren't things everyone is experiencing. Probably only a couple dozen million people have any of these types of devices. That's a lot of incidences.
Jeezus H Christ on a stick. I'm a consultant to the biomedical engineering industry, and this is the first I've ever heard of this. It's heartbreaking. FDA is all that stands between us and eye-of-newt superstition in place of data-informed actual medicine.
Medical device safety is a giant black hole. Safety monitoring is both incredibly difficult from fundamental logistics and constrained by (insanely ignorant) decisions made decades ago in order to expedite device time-to-market. Devices are approved based on prior approvals for devices of only vague similarity (very similar, in fact, to the FAA's approval of the Boeing 737 Max 8 based on the prior approval of the Boeing 737 in the 1960s). At the same time Billions of dollars are being spent on new devices and direct-to-physician marketing by medical device manufacturers with very little oversight. It's exactly like the pharma situation, just even more shadowy and unregulated. Edit: For people who are interested, the classic example of MDM safety failure can be found in the metal-on-metal hip implant aseptic failure debacle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_repla ... nt_failure The FDA didn't (and still doesn't as far as I'm aware) require human testing of new prosthetic joint designs as long as they're ""substantially similar"" to previous joint designs. Which led to the introduction of metal-on-metal prosthetic hips, which were billed as superior to previous metal/teflon designs because the material was less prone to wear... Except then people started noticing that some hips were coming back with metal shavings stuck in massive scar tissue buildup in peoples joints, cobalt and chromium-associated tissue necrosis. Only a very expansive review (of UK implants, because of course the US wasn't tracking it) was able to definitively show that the all-metal joints were failing at a higher rate than the ""standard"" counterparts. And because of that the FDA radically changed its review process for all... Oh wait! No they just changed the review process for metal-on-metal joints, not for any other MDMs because the same problem definitely couldn't occur with other types of implants.! Last edited by Happy Medium on Tue May 21, 2019 2:42 pm
Can we get a name in the FDA that authorized it?
Well I'm no fan of the orange ass but this predates him by about a decade. ""Medtronic recalled the device in 2007..."" Could this be the equivalent of Boeing writing the aviation safety regs?
On the bright side, you can't addict an entire community to implants. Well, except Orange County.
Idle speculation: is it that they don't know not to use them in that case or that they don't know the patient has one implanted to begin with? I could see that going either way. Someone comes in crashing out and they might not even the person's name at that point to pull records.
Now this is in the open, there might well be people being charged eventually. But this being kept for over a decade says it wasn't likely (just) an individual choice; it says something about the FDA culture - as some other comments mention: orgs like these are always torn between 'needs to cost less, get products that save lives/environment/loads of money quicker to market and do not limit companies' versus 'but is safety guarded/considered well enough' - especially with potentially life saving devices/medicines, there is always huge pressure to speed up the process.
Speaking as someone who worked in an ER, the fact is, you don't always know someone has one to begin with. In an emergency, using paddles is often the only way to stop an otherwise deadly arrhythmia (non-regular heart beat) to restore a normal heart beat. Most humans don't come with ""CAUTION ICD IMPLANTED"" tattooed on their chests, either. Many such patients end up in hospitals where access to their records is either moot, or unavailable. They know you shouldn't use that method of cardioversion on people who have ICD's. They just don't usually know that the patient has one when they do. As for the FDA, just like the FCC, I've long since given up any hope of it being anything more than a rubber-stamp committee for corporate interests, simply because it's so slow to act, and so weak in action. Whatever pretense it once had at keeping quacks and snake oil away from the public has been buried under a flood of corporate ""benefits"" or promises of post government wealth.
They're pretty hard to miss when you have someone's chest completely exposed for emergency medical treatment. There's significant scarring and a raised portion of skin over the pacemaker. And, reading some of the MAUDE comments, you get the feeling that some people just really shouldn't be allowed to work in trauma medicine. Last edited by IntellectualThug on Tue May 21, 2019 1:29 pm
I'd beg to differ. Ever wonder why prosthetic joint implant rates and other orthopedic surgeries have risen at ASTRONOMICAL rates despite multiple studies showing that they frequently aren't any better (sometimes worse in the case of spine surgery) than conservative therapies such as physical therapy? People are desperate for quick-fixes for chronic problems.
Dare I ask if the data in the alternative summary reporting database will be placed in MAUDE? Or just deleted? (Yes, I know the obvious answer.) Last edited by Long Time Lurker on Tue May 21, 2019 1:33 pm
Absolutely disgusting. This is the kind of news you expect to (and actually do see) in developing countries and banana republics where corruption, malpractice and ignorance put patients' lives at risk by giving faulting medico-pharma conglomerates a wide berth and next to no accountability in favor of padding each other's pockets. This shouldn't be something that we should have to deal with in the US.

I've worked in the medical device industry for years, and even I haven't heard of this alternative reporting site. What I do know is that this weakening of the FDA has been going on for years, as Big Pharma and med device companies have been pushing to reduce regulations and oversight so they can get treatments to market that much faster. It should be no surprise that this sort of thing is the result. I know that repubs want to cut regulations, because it ""stymies innovation"", but what good is the innovation if it kills the patient?
FDA, FAA, FCC ... LOL!!!
If it starts with an ""F"", you can pretty much bet that it stands for ""fucked"".
Well the innovator and their company rakes in millions, so, again, what is the downside to dead people hidden in a secret ""public"" database?
What good is it? It's easier (and far more profitable) to make a buck killing people than it is to make a buck saving their lives.
Unregulated capitalism continues to claim more victims. The push to make more and more money, aided and abetted by politician who are themselves on the take, is destroying our country and killing people.
The ultimate goal is to make TWO bucks by keeping them almost alive again and again and again. Repeat customers are best customers after all. (I hate myself for typing that, it's sad we have come to this)
Unfortunately, you are all too correct.
If the latter, is there a recognized mark they can opt to receive? Like a lightning bolt with a prohibition symbol over the sternum or something.
This was the Bush 43rd FDA. Remember those halcyon days?
Ahh yes, when I thought we couldn't choose much worse than ""W"". How wrong I was and how far we have fallen.

So they push for the implant a lot more. Cutter's going to cut. It's what they do.
Wow. I've also worked in the medical device industry and actually worked on systems to submit medical device reports to the FDA and never heard about this alternative reporting system. On the one hand I find it encouraging in regards to my former employer--on the systems I built and maintained there wasn't any practical way to divert complaints to this shadow reporting. On the other hand, it almost entirely excludes the possibility that this was any where close to an ""honest mistake."" Presuming we handled complaints and reporting in a similar fashion as other manufacturers (a reasonable presumption since we all use one of small number of applications and pull from a small pool of consultants who work on such systems; any great departure from what our competitors do would have been noted) such a complaint would have to be either entered into an alternate system from first reporting or diverted very early in the investigation process. I am very skeptical that this was ""set up to cut down on paperwork for redundant incident reports."" Basically to get out of the normal reporting process, the decision would have to be made before anyone could really say the report would ultimately be redundant. This stinks, and I really hope these reports are transferred to MAUDE and become public. edit: Reading the original KHN reports, ""The agency said it will open past records to the public within weeks."" Good news there. But the main issue still does not compute. If a particular issue or mode of failure is common for a particular device, it does make some sense to allow a summary report with a list of incidents rather than require a report for each incident. But that comes no where close to explaining why the listing of individual incidents would not be public. Last edited by mcmnky on Tue May 21, 2019 2:20 pm
How about you read an article before commenting? This is a historical screwup, not something new in the last few years. If you want to randomly blame a current president, it would be more accurate to say that Trump’s FDA stopped this goddamned idiocy. But in actual fact this is about the FDA, not some president.
I've submitted complaint reports, (MDRs, or Medwatches), to the FDA for years, including on pacemakers and ICDs, and I have never heard of this alternate site. This makes me think that the reports are diverted once they get to FDA, as there is just one FDA site to submit those reports.
I keep saying America is becoming a third world country, complete with Banana Republicans sucking the life blood out by the barrel full. Here's a few links to what living in a Republican paradise looks like: https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG ... id=US%3Aen https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEP ... id=US%3Aen https://www.npr.org/sections/health-sho ... -health-ca The Democrats are also guilty because they are a feckless, leaderless, spineless ship of fools who do nothing but piss and moan instead of talking non-stop about shit like I posted above. It makes me think they are just playing stupid and are in on the game. People keep saying I'm blowing things out of portion, it's all hyperbole, etc. All you need do is pay attention to the shit going on. And of course Donald Trump is president. That alone shows how far things have gone. But hey, let's go to war with Iran because America, Fick yeah!
The question is whether in ""shutting down"" the alternative is going to happen before all those reports are migrated to the existing public database? If not, are those reports going to essentially disappear for some time?
This program needs jail time for those who signed off on it. Medical outcomes and costs need transparency. We need to kill off these secrecy mongerers.
This is absolutely heartbreaking (no pun intended). FDA is the one department that needs to be completely above this sort of incompetence (probably corruption). On a similar note, has anyone here watched the last season of The Resident on FOX? The season focuses on corruption in the medical device industry using this exact device (one that causes random shocks and malfunctioning during cardiac events to patients). It is the first medical drama series I'm following since House.
Judging from the article: Josiah Zayner has validated every ""You can't practice medicine without a license law"" ever written.
What a dumbass. Next, I'll get a spider to bite me to get spidey-powers. Oh, wait...
Jesus, what a fucking moron. CRISPR doesn't do shit unless directly, meticulously, and carefully injected into the interior of the cell. There's no way some random pile of bullshit DNA enzymes is going to breach the cell wall of a human tissue cell.
Why would he do that, instead of just using tried-and-true radioactive spider venom?
You want Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? That's how you get Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Wait, so he only practiced on himself? I guess it's like suicide then: It's attempted murder. Edit: He's been selling his gene editing kits. I'd say give him the book. This isn't Futurama yet, where you can properly get fish gills installed in your back yard alley. Last edited by smoothsorbate on Thu May 16, 2019 3:15 pm
Radioactive spider venom adds strength, but doesn't increase muscle mass. If you want bigger muscles, you have to expose yourself to gamma rays. Last edited by Batmanuel on Thu May 16, 2019 3:08 pm

On one hand, he's an idiot. On the other hand, I'm not sure if anything he's done actually falls under ""practicing medicine"".
Is it illegal to practice medicine on yourself? Unless you're injecting yourself with new and exciting forms of infectious diseases, I don't see the public business/interest in preventing such behavior. I know ""we can be mad at two things at once"" but it's really hard to take any probe into this admitted idiot seriously in light of pharmaceutical companies putting people into penury for insulin at pennies on the dollar.
He's an idiot, for sure. But practicing medicine? I'm not really convinced what he's doing qualifies...especially since there's no way for those kits to do what he seems to think they can. (I mean, even if you modify the DNA in a few of your cells, it's not going to magically propagate to the rest of them...) EDIT: ninja'd Last edited by lewax00 on Thu May 16, 2019 3:08 pm
The story might be frightening, but this man is a harmless idiot compared to those who will eventually use genetic engineering for bad purposes systematically. The only questions are when, and what will be the damage.
Dumbass needs to learn that he has the right to remain silent.
Why can't the FDA use this ""illegally practicing medicine"" law to shut down sites promoting falsified science to push anti-vaccine crap, or sites like Goop that sell nonsense to people like sticking eggs all up in themselves to cure some disease or promote some health benefit?
I fuck with the human germ line for fun and profit. There's so much to gain, with LITERALLY ZERO downsides!
To add to the list: homeopaths, essential oils...
Wait, there is an actual 'bio-hacking' community? I feel like walking into a bio-hacking 'con would be like walking into a room full of circus freaks with every type of failed experiment you can think of.
deleteing myostatin? huh? what does that do? oh myostatin regulates growth of muscles? do you want cancer because this is how you get cancer. Last edited by fishbait on Thu May 16, 2019 3:13 pm
He's being investigated for selling DIY CRISPR kits...the FDA wouldn't give a hoot if the only thing he did was inject himself with dna goo.
Normally, biohacking is just a bunch of people sewing watches to their heads, or implanting magnets in their fingertips. This is the first time someone's actually gone so far as to CRISPR themselves.
Jade Moon-Vagina Eggs... Gwyneth Paltrow will never, ever live that down. And, I think Beth Mole is the one who reported on it back in the day...
His martyrdom complex appears intact, and indeed, quite healthy.
Selling CRISPR isn't practicing medicine though, or else an awful lot of biology lab companies are breaking the law.
Maybe real geneticists can use CRISPR to edit his brain cells.
is CRISPR officially recognized as a medicine? Seems more equivalent to selling lab equipment -- more ""selling the tools of the trade of medicine"" and less ""selling medicine"" to me
For tried and true - steroids and HGH. Seriously, that's pretty much the staple of the male competitive bodybuilder. Just enjoy the roid-rage, genital issues, and likelihood of an early death.
It's selling the tools to a bunch of people with instructions on how to use these tools to practice medicine on yourself. ...you have to catch your own skinks for genetic material, though.
Well the Extremis virus uses some form of gene editing...
Wow. Just wow. This seems to have horror-movie synopsis levels of ""This Is A Bad Idea"" stamped all over every aspect of Zaynor's business and conduct. D.I.Y genetic engineering? Really... that's a thing these days?! I totally do not see any issues with providing this kind of techniques (CRISPR) or technology to potentially unqualified individuals in a framework exempt of any ethical standards, oversight or for that matter effective containment practices. No potential issues, whatsoever. /s Yeesh.
Idiots should be free to do with their bodies as they wish. Anyone aiding these idiots without a license is a completely different question. That **is** practicing medicine and shouldn't be allowed. Do humans have the right to control the own bodies? I believe the answer must be yes. Yes, for suicide of the terminally ill. Yes, for unwanted pregnancies. Yes, for genetically changing your toe nail coloring, if you like. Doesn't matter. ""Pursuit of happiness"" clause and all that, right? Last edited by TheFu on Thu May 16, 2019 3:20 pm
Holy crap, this is crazy! So, yeah, he's dumb and the way he did it wouldn't have worked anyway. But how long until you can order a DIY virus & CRISPR kit from the dark web and synthesize whatever you want? The next few decades are gonna be nuts. (Also, do you want the zombie apocalypse? Because this is how you get the zombie apocalypse!)
That's debatable. Some would argue if he wants to be a lunatic and screw up his own body, experimentally, who are we to stop him? Sure, it makes sense if he's trying to inject OTHER people, but if it's himself? /shrug

Myostatin regulation gene deletion wouldn't affect cancer rates. The real problem is your caloric and protein intake needs skyrocket to keep up with all the muscle synthesis. This is evolutionarily very expensive, and as evidenced by history, not terribly necessary. Neanderthal are actually theorized to have been much stronger and perhaps actually more intelligent than us, but that came at a baseline metabolism that was 500-1000kcal higher per day. In lean times with high competition against homo sapiens sapiens this was a severe liability.
Ideally - he would need to modify a virus as the delivery system to insert the altered DNA.
I wouldn't trust the guy with the glitter pens and patches necessary for jean editing. Oh, sorry, what?!?
Way longer than Michio Kaku would have you think. This stuff is still super-computer-and-PhD-only territory. Recombinant DNA and epigenetics are quite possibly the most complex subject of enquiry the field of biology has ever tried to tackle. The only thing that might beat it out is large scale ecology analysis. Both are deeply empirical challenges that will require exhaustive expert analysis to even begin to get a handle on doing safely and reliably.
I just did a text-search for ""Florida"" and was shocked to come up with nothing.

Assholes.
I'm surprised there wasn't a cameo video appearance by the Pathological Liar in Chief. I guess the event was going on at the same time as Hannity.
I really wish there wasn't an ethical conundrum in banning lying fucking liars from lying in public.
Enemy combatants engaging in bio terrorism. Drone strikes should solve the problem.
Wakefield needs to be charged with the deaths of every child who died of a preventable disease since he falsified his data.
Having been stripped of his medical license, is it not unlawful for Mr. Wakefield to preface his name with the title of ""Doctor""?
In all seriousness, could this not be construed to be some form of inciting violence? I guess for that we'd first need to classify not vaccinating oneself without proper reason to be a form of assault, but arguably it is, only using biological weapons. (Which doesn't exactly make it seem better) Also, fuck these asshats
Scumbags gonna scum. It's baffling that people continue to listen to Wakefield. The man is so obviously, transparently evil.
How do we go about getting someone charged with murder if their intentional spread of misinformation results in someone's death? Last edited by Dark Pumpkin on Tue May 14, 2019 11:45 am
Well he was stripped in the UK, does he hold a license in the US? Also if he completed a PhD course, he can be called doctor regardless. My wife is a DVM graduate from Brazil and while due to professional association protections can't call herself a vet here in Canada, she technically can go by the title of Doctor if she wishes (she doesn't).
Murder might be a stretch, but manslaughter for sure.
No ethical issues there at all. If your lies cause others DEMONSTRABLE harm, you should be held liable. It's not a first amendment thing to sue people, or jail them, for endangering the public with words alone. Hell, the U.S. has killed them with drone strikes in the past. If it didn't open such a major can of due process worms, I'd advocate that kind of response to people like these. We even have the exact kind of thing that can do that.

I'm not seeing a major difference between this and terrorism.
As far as I'm concerned, about ten steps back from here. Fraud, theft by deception, I don't know. Not a lawyer, but I would applaud efforts by a prosecutor to get this tried as a kind of assault (measles constituting harm by willful deceit and/or negligence that the speaker knew would happen or be expected). I don't think that would work, but I so want it to.
The rational person in me knows it's cruel and horrible to state that, if someone, say the mother of a child permanently disabled or killed because of these lies, ran up to people like this and lobbed a lit Molotov cocktail in their face, I would ask ""Is there video of it? Is it in HD?"" But the longer these people keep this shit up, the harder it is to keep that dark little gremlin locked away in my mind. These people are actively peddling lies and mistruths that actively spread disease, illness, and human suffering. They are making life worse for us. What else is there to say?

Nope. Assuming he really did get his MD (not going to check), his licensing status has nothing to do with his academic achievement. Now, what this says about such academic achievement is another discussion....
I don't think it's far fetched to assume that they've literally taken a page from the NRA playbook.
Obligatory IANAL, but as far as I understand US law, this speech does not rise to the level of unprotected speech.
No, it's a generic human playbook. People have been lying through their teeth since language existed. Flinging literal and metaphorical poo likely goes back even further.
Someone needs to call the Arlington hotel and see how they feel about supporting antivaxers?
That image caption: ""Andrew Wakefield, disgraced former doctor found to have committed fraudulent research."" Should be included in any & every mention of his name.
This stuff, flat eartherism, and climate change denial tend to run in some of the same circles. I feel like we are regressing as a society.
What are the leaders of the anti-vax community getting out of their efforts? The only thing I can think of is some mix of savior complex based on their ""beliefs"" about vaccines. It must be a pretty potent reward.
These gatherings of the criminally stupid make a strong case for precision orbital strikes.
Two words: Domestic terrorism. It's pretty much that simple. The only difference is the means by which it's done. I'd love to see Wakefield's financials and how many shell companies pay him leading back to someplace in Moscow. This is the exact kind of thing the Russians (or enemies of the West, let's not be picky) would finance to weaken the alliance.
Time to prosecute for lying.
A fool and their money are easily separated. And it's pretty foolish to believe the bs spouted about vaccines.

The laws were met with immediate resistance from citizens who demanded the right to control their bodies and those of their children.[3] The Anti Vaccination League and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League formed in response to the mandatory laws, and numerous anti-vaccination journals sprang up.

Where is Deadpool when he is needed?
Some people are, but some are going the exact opposite way. It's basically positive feedback loops at work, from my perspective; it's just a matter of what path you choose. Do you get locked into regressive nationalism, conspiracy theories, and other such drivel? Or do you become more engaged with politics or other groups and actively contribute, like I do with the DSA? I'm also wondering when there will be a tipping point regarding these people. At what point do managers start firing people because ""You refuse to get vaccinated, you have no medical reason to justify why, you are a contagion risk, terminated with cause"", then come the lawsuits...
At what point does this become the equivalent of shouting fire in a crowded theater? Edit: I guess it's more like shouting ""everything's okay"" in a crowded theater while setting a fire.... Last edited by gaballard on Tue May 14, 2019 11:58 am

All of them are based on conspiracy theories and a complete distrust of the mainstream. Seems like they would appeal to the same group of people.

Execute them.
I am usually on the side of capitalism, but I would not be opposed to nationalizing the drug manufacturing business, at least for generics.
I hope the states go all the way through trial and are able to get a favorable verdict to really put fear into these companies' boards and exec suites. I fear they'll just settle for pennies on the dollar, a pinky promise to not misbehave for a few years, and then it'll be back to this behavior when everyone forgets.
I was initially pleased to see the generic manufacturer that I worked for for a few months after college wasn't on the list, but then on a suspicion of capitalism, I checked their wiki page and they were bought by Pfizer a few years ago. So they are at the very least guilty by association.
I love their response: ""Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion man. Accusations. We haven't done anything that would result in us being liable for anything."" Note: they didn't deny doing it, just that they think they won't really get in trouble for it. Which is exactly why they did it.
This is straight up conspiracy. Can the Feds RICO the fuck out of these bastards? Ideally, I'd like to see everyone on the board in prison and their personal property seized, but I guess I could settle for seeing their buttocks skinned and forcing them to sit on a block of salt, with a vial of Vicodin or Oxycontin dangling just out of reach.
Too easy. Years in prison for everyone involved who perpetrated it and confiscating every. Single. Goddamned. Penny to their name. Kick them out on the street after they've served their time without two nickels to rub together. It's worse than death to the type of people willing to do this. Gee... who'd have thought that unrepentant ""Fuck You, Got Mine"" mentality, the sputtering mess that is the American health care system, and introducing profit motive to medicine would not end so well? Never hear about this shit going on in the EU or Canada... wonder why...
Which is why all the big wigs insist on flying to these events and attending in person. It's much safer to plan crimes with your buddies when inside of a private yacht, dining room, or clubhouse, far away from technology and prying eyes. Now you know why all these twerps love golfing.
Fuck em all to death, before Trump can pardon them all.

And nothing will change out of this because at this point they know voting doesn't have enough consequences for them (ie 80% chance they can just ""donate"" a high enough amount of money to any politician elected to ""persuade"" them about their ""thoughts"" on doing business as usual"". As long as Citizens United stands, voting won't change much. But good luck getting Citizens United removed in the first place with anything but force at this point, unless anyone else has a better idea.
Maybe. But it's starting to look like both parties will be trying to capitalize on punishing the pharmaceutical industry this election season - there's been quite a bit of rumbling and finger-pointing from both sides already - and Trump hasn't shown any particular penchant for pardoning his cronies that are already in prison yet. I don't have high hopes, but it may turn out that drug companies will make a good whipping horse and get a portion of what's coming to them.
Minor note: the plural of attorney general is actually attorneys general. See also: passerby & passersby.
Now for similar investigation on ISPs ...
Got evidence? Then prosecute and PUT THEM IN JAIL. And bring death sentences to the corporations that did it in the way of fines which put them out of business. And when they go out of business, take the patents that they developed on these drugs and make them royalty free (after conviction of course). None of that is ever going to happen.
As relevant to this topic today, as it was to whatever idiocy set Ken off 3 years ago: It's not RICO - Popehat.
We are in the age of literally cartoonishly evil corporate executives.
I've seen that, and enjoyed it. But in this particular case it might, actually, be RICO. If this doesn't stink of organized racketeering, I don't know what does.
The fines will be equal to 0.0000001% of profits from said policies and they'll never be paid. Hip hip, hurrah!
Just a helpful reminder that the President cannot pardon for state crimes, only federal. A cursory glance at this seems to say it's both federal and state, so even if all federal crimes are pardoned, can't happen for state. Boy oh boy will the first few days of Trump out of office be a sight to behold thanks to the New York State Attorney General sitting there, waiting... Last edited by Deputy Cartman on Mon May 13, 2019 4:05 pm
Yeah, let’s see if anyone actually goes to jail over this or if it’s just a bunch of fines that get whittled away to nothing on appeal. Justice isn’t blind, it’s for sale and nobody with sacks of cash ever gets held accountable.
You know, most things random people say about pharmaceutical companies are complete bullshit, but then we have companies like Purdue pushing oxycontin, Turing buying up old drugs and adding several zeroes to their prices, and now this shit. It makes people question things that can save their lives, which makes this behavior worse than simple greed - it's systematically fucking up mankind. We need to give the FDA and FTC their teeth back. Regulatory Capture is real.
Simple pass a law that the state can manufacture them also, and lets let them compete. Would also help to fight “shortages” that recently suddenly are so common... The state doesn’t need to have the right to be sole provider, let the state compete with the companies, if they’re so sure they can do it more cheaply then the state, let them prove it. And in the meantime, let them prove that it can’t be done more cheaply at all...
Well, after all this is said and done, they're gonna get hit with a whopping fine of about 20-30% of a quarter's profits. That'll show them, and fix the problem of the high prices and ensure it never happens again! It definitely wont be written off as a cost of doing business, nosiree! ... am I getting too cynical?
And yet there are still people who say capitalism is great for everyone. Maybe if you are in top 0.1%. For everyone else, we are just dupes for them to rob as they smile at us and our total inability to do anything about it. Robbin' Hood indeed. I hear the hoofbeats of Dennis Moore's swift horse Concorde.
Report all you want, but the execs are too busy dancing to the disco remix of the hit single ""Walk Like a Shkreli"" in their penthouse suites to care.
Two maintenance drugs I take every day and a few that I’ve been prescribed from time to time are on this list. The sentiment would be there even if my little gray pills weren’t on the list, but this makes it truly personal: Throw the fucking book at them.
It's a good idea, but look what happened when municipalities tried to offer their own Internet service. Despite being in grossly underserved areas, the private sector howled like banshees over ""unfair"" competition - since government bodies don't have to operate under a profit incentive, and could therefore undercut private companies. Same thing would happen here.

This is because some English terms came from French and so they exhibit vestigial French grammar.
No surprises here. It appears the invisible hand of the free market has once again given us the finger.

At this point, I would wager that even used car salesmen are considered more trustworthy and likeable than the average CEO.
CEO's make more money than the garbage collector employee and yet their trusting them not to spill state's secrets to anyone which is pretty ironic.
Yes, yes and they could be advocates for business..uh...no wait...CONSUMERS!
It'd be nice if we could collect all the prison time we inflict on kids with an ounce or two of marijuana in their pockets and instead imprison all these C-level assholes that defraud my grandma for her HBP meds.
Same for me, yeah. Five of the meds I've been on in the last 15 years are on that list, having been forced to switch to alternatives when my new insurance company refused to cover them due to cost. While I am not currently paying out of pocket for all of them, Celecoxib is one I have to because it's the most effective non-opioid non-ORC painkiller I have found to date. Moreover, one of the medications on that list is the one that has worked extremely well for my wife in the past and which insurance also won't cover due to cost. At least for mine there's a coupon that knocks it down to barely affordable but there's no such option for hers and it's a huge pain for her, literally. I hope they finally nail these sons of bitches to the courthouse wall, metaphorically speaking. If they accept some sort of ""admit no wrongdoing"" bullshit settlement, I'm going to be furious with the states, not just the asshats who've actively made my life literally more painful than it needs to have been.
If they were making a 1:1 gundam model like they have in Japan, I'd be impressed.
I think it's cool someone made an entire business out of making Lego replicas of the real world.
Oooh, I'd love to see this one day - the model of Durham cathedral is spectacular, and I donated a fair few quid to it myself.
Oh my... Well I know where I'm spending a few bucks soon.
This looks awesome. But D.C. has quakes?? I thought having them in Oklahoma was weird enough.
Very rare, but there was one nearby a few years ago.
Why would the president have anything to do with this? It's a private project, on private land, modeling a private cathedral.
Yup. 5.8 magnitude. Damaged the Washington Monument and closed it for quite a while, thought it's reopen again.
Because Trump thinks he's King of America.
Yep, just yesterday we found out that Trump wants to move the D.C. 4th of July celebration (on very, very short notice) just so it can be all about him. Bastard.
Well he is trumped. The head of the Episcopalian Church is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II
Please can we keep this comment section about lego and cathedrals ? We’ll have poneys if we stay quiet for the next 10 pages.
Or maybe they tried and the crosses are 1 pixel in size...
Oh please - did you start out with the deliberate intention of finding something to be offended by ? Look at the picture of the real floor, then compare it to the lego floor section. The crosses on the real floor are inside the diamond shapes - which makes them correspond to the single stud in the centre of the diamond on the lego floor panel. So unless you can find a standard single stud piece with a printed or incised cross present, then they can't directly represent the crosses. So no, this isn't a deliberate omission for some anti-religious cause, but a deliberate admission of contructional constraints and reality.
I must be building Lego wrong, I don't even have a hard hat. It's a health and safety nightmare! Must remember helmet and high visibility vest next time. Seriously though, I love to see what people manage to make out of Lego. I hope we get an update when the build is finished.
I'm still trying to wrap my mind around 500,000 bricks of lego. My inner child is running wild at the thought of having that many to play with. This is seriously impressive though, dang.
Not the only company. Been following this guy for a few years. Lots of very big custom buildings. https://www.facebook.com/Inspiredbricks/
Important: does the model of the cathedral contain a model of the cathedral?!
Yes. Third to last picture in the first set.

At the scale they’re using, the cross detail corresponds to the “atom” of LEGO, a single stud (edit: actually they’ve got a 1x1 tile snapped over the stud, same diff). Short of making a whole new LEGO piece just to make you happy, or making the entire model three times bigger so you could make a cross with tiles, it’s simply not possible. By all means, design, manufacture, and donate a few thousand 1x1 tiles with a patonce cross design molded on the face, I’m sure they would be thrilled at your generosity. Here’s another idea, stop being a dick on the internet. Back on topic, how cool! Once they have this done, they need a little RC robot with an HD camera to give tours.

So, if they apparently take no issue with the tiny little detail that you've focused like a butthurt, offended laser beam on, why should anyone else?

If you think shapes are bad, just wait until you hear about this new threat: colors!
And does the model of the cathedral contain a model of the model of the cathedral? This could be quite a long thread...
f(Cathedral)=cathedral+1 cathedral≥1 Done
How far does the recursion go, though? Does that model have an even smaller model? One can only hope...
The space between the Legos in the arch over the window? Probably aren't Lego pigeons the right size. I'm certain of: None that can poop from there. Not an edit but almost: I'd bet that pooping plastic pigeons exist, but none by Lego.
After some further googling, cabcx’s complaint is even dumber. Take a look at this shot of the nave floor: You can see that some areas are decorated with patonce crosses which is what he’s so upset about, but others have a simple diamond shape. So, maybe they have a plan (of course they do)? In actual fact, there’s even more shapes on other parts of the floor - other heraldic cross types and also other geometric shapes.

I'm bewildered. Unless you're trolling - and frankly what could be more sad than trolling a Lego thread - then I simply cannot see how you take the two sets of facts presented in the article, namely the image of the real floor, and the (tiny) image of the lego floor, and come to such a conclusion - such a definite conclusion and definite reason to take offense. So what does the original floor look like ? Well at the highest level we have squares. At the second level we have rotated squares (diamonds) within the level 1 squares. At the tertiary level we have crosses within the level 2 diamonds. We also have subsidiary squares, three wide, alongside the primary squares, and which I'd place at level 2 in the design hierarchy. And now what does the Lego floor look like. Well we have squares at level 1, and diamonds at level 2, just like the real floor. We also have the subsidiary squares at level 2, but there aren't enough studs to fit these in three-wide, so we've reduced them to just two. This is the first sign of a scaling issue coming into place. And what about the crosses at level three ? Well we've represented them as well, but as they've scaled down to the size of a single stud ... and you can't model a cross in one stud. But if you really believe that crosses are easy, and this is a deliberate omission to belittle your faith, then please show us how this should have been done, without scaling the floor tile sections to make them excessively large ...
Actually that picture is very informative. I just posted that they scaled down the three subsidiary squares alongside the primary squares to just two. But looking at your picture, the central aisle down the nave does just have two smaller squares alongside each primary square ... and no crosses! So it's quite possible that the tiny floor section shown in the picture is intended for the central aisle and is very accurate, and that there may be larger floor squares planned that do include the cross motif for the ends of the nave.
It wasn't based in D.C.; the epicenter was in Mineral, VA, closer to Richmond and about an hour from D.C. It did a bunch of damage there. The bedrock here is good for carrying earthquakes long distances. We had a small bit of damage here in Charlottesville.
The whole thing is in the shape of a cross, and they're using it to raise money for the second-largest church in America. But they don't have the crosses on the floor so: War on Christianity, my friends... War on Christianity. /s As a Jew, I would love it if people's reaction to my religion were ""merely"" that they couldn't fit one of its symbols into a Lego model of a synagogue. I'd trade that for gas chambers any time. Wanna swap prejudices? I'd love to be able to get all up-in-arms because people want to say ""Happy Holidays"" instead of ""Merry Christmas"". Instead, when I go to my nephew's Bar Mitzvah, I have to knock on the synagogue doors for someone to let me in because -- even during services -- the building is kept locked because of all the death threats. War on Christianity. Give me a fucking break. Learn some history, and you'll see what it really means when someone declares war on your religion. Fucking snowflakes.
Good.
Great move. Although I would make it that simply children are taken away by the police to get vaccinated and that is that. It is high time that we get rid of this idiotic notion that just because you are a parent that you have absolute authority over your child and are allowed to harm it based on all kinds of idiotic ideas (anti-vaccine, religion, political views and so on).
I think Germany is probably a country that for some reason is skeptical of granting the police the unilateral power to do something like take minors away from their homes.
How about just require vaccination for enrollment in school (with only medical exemption allowed). The idea of having a personal exemption and then fining people for using said personal exemption is kinda stupid. Just get rid of the personal exemption. As CA showed you can get 95%+ vaccination rates by just getting rid of personal/religious exemptions. It is the no brainer option to try first. Last edited by Statistical on Mon May 06, 2019 10:35 am
I would not only levy the fine, but treat it like a traffic offense (how we handle them locally). In other words, if you agree to get your whole family vaccinated AND bring paperwork to court showing that you've in fact done so by the county health department, then your fine could be reduced by a percentage. I'd also tie the fine to income and increase it for failure to comply, so a millionaire can't just pay the fine once every 6 months while putting the public at risk. But, the German proposal is a good start!
Count me well off the ""this political view is illegal"" train.
His human suffering comment is spot on and is more than enough of a reason for everyone medically able to get vaccinated, period, end of discussion.
Gee, I guess this means Jenny McCarthy is going to take Germany off her travel recommendation list!
Agreed, if you would be exempt from vaccinations you should also be exempt from participating in public things.
In the US we have Child Protective Services but it's not really that far off from being ""the police"" and they often work together. I'm not German but it seems like they have a department called Jugendamt (Google translates as ""Youth Welfare Office"") which accomplishes something similar.

There is a fine line between personal freedom and societal obligation, and pro-plaguers have decided that their personal freedom is more important than their obligations to society. It is selfish, and their actions (or actually, inactions), bring potential harm to anyone and everyone around them. Would they feel the same for something like polio, or typhus, or smallpox?
That is not possible in Germany. Attending school is a legal requirement so it is impossible for the state to ban children from the schools. This is why they can do that to kita (kindergarten for really small kids) and kindergarten but not the schools.
Attending school is a legal requirement in California as well (and every state in the US and I would imagine most first world nations). You have to get vaccinated (or have a valid medical exemption) to attend public school in California. If you aren't vaccinated you need to find a private school willing to take unvaccinated children (increasingly rare). It is the simplest solution to try first. If you still don't have sufficient vaccination rates then look to more complex supplemental measures but it really does work. California saw high compliance and vaccination rates went up across the state. Last edited by Statistical on Mon May 06, 2019 10:44 am
It's not about legality. It's about justification of abuse. You can believe in whatever you want as long as those beliefs do not adversely impact on other members of society and especially on children who are one of the more valuable and important members of the society. That's why it was so pathetic of Merkel and co when they scrambled to introduce a law protecting mutilation of children (circumcision in that case ) after a German court declared it illegal as you are abusing a child with some random excuse. If someone who is 18+ wants to do it go to the hospital and go at it but you should not be allowed to force someone else just because you are somehow biologically related to them.
That's silly. Schooling is a legal requirement here as well, and CA made it work. Government's requirements (and exemptions/exceptions) change all the time. It would be a simple matter to amend that legal requirement to include this idea.
they have other means, say reduce maternity and paternity leaves - if they miss recommended vaccination - rather than wait til school age and penalize the children from being educated for parents' stupidity.
Are you really trying to argue that the state's hands are tied because the state passed a law limiting what the state can do? In an article where the state's health minister is explicitly talking about changing laws?
You may want to familiarize yourself with moderately recent German history.
Schools are far more regulated in Germany and to be honest that is a good thing or you end up with ""home schooling"", religious schools and other such obscenities. Which is why the better option is simply to force vaccination as fines will be too small for the rich sporting idiotic beliefs and it will disproportionately harm the poorer people who tend to have lower education level and are easier prey for the sellers of bullshit.
Some of them, yes. https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03 ... -vaccines/
There are certain laws that are based on the basic law and changing those is far more difficult. German constitutional court is not some kind of rubber stamping operation. They have many times struck down laws that are not compatible with the basic law of Germany.
CPS rarely removes kids, despite their reputation, partially because there aren't enough homes for them. They're also overworked and underpaid and don't need hundreds of thousands of new cases dropped on them.

This makes exclusions problematic legally - it doesn't seem that Strasbourg has yet ruled on the matter though there is a case that has been communicated to them.

How would that work? Children can't receive the MMR till at least 12 to 15 months of age (hence why the MMR is so important - the youngest can't get the vaccine yet). Maternity leave only goes up till that 12 month minimum age. Just how generous is Germany’s leave policy? During the six weeks before and eight weeks after giving birth, women earn their full paycheck while out on maternity leave. After that, until their child is 12 months, they make 65 percent of their monthly salary, up to a cap of 1,800 euros a month. Even the lowest-paid workers earn 300 euros a month—and unemployed women, too! There’s even better news for women having their second child: They get a 10 percent ""sibling bonus""—an additional 75 euros a month, at least. (Dads, by the way, also get paid leave for up to 12 months.) https://www.workingmother.com/this-is-w ... nity-leave You'd only be able to target those expecting a second child.
How about also slapping the parents in the face.
We have a similar organization in The Netherlands and they do take children away from their parents when they neglect or abuse their kids. The notion that parents have an absolute right to decide what is good for their children thus already doesn't exist. Not here, not in Germany and not in the US. Taking a child to be vaccinated against the wish of the parents is therefore not as big a step as people keep suggesting. If you define not vaccinating as abuse equal to beating a child, everything is already in place to enable it. And considering that, like beating a child, not vaccinating a child can cause both physical and psychological harm and even death I don't see why we should not do that.

Or professional ""dartgunners"" that identify and vaccinate the children (from a safe distance of course, you never know how these wild animals will react), pay them a small stipend, their real reward will be the satisfaction of a job well done....../s
According to RKI, there are plenty that are due well before the year - this is pretty similar to CDC. I agree that the delinquent parents should be penalized on m/paternity leaves on the subsequent children as well. Anyhoo, for your reference... https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/Ep ... cationFile
But doesn't this imply that anti-vax parents want their children to be educated?
Twice.
Quote: ""But doesn't this imply that anti-vax parents want their children to be educated?"" If their kids got an education, they'd see what dolts their parents are, so probably not.
Parents who don't vaccinated their children aren't fit to be parents, thus their children should be taken from them.
Unless I’m mistaken Germany already does this for violating traffic laws, and I agree with this concept wholeheartedly. The point of fines is to monetarily punish someone for violating the law, or recklessly endangering others... punishing one person while mildly inconveniencing another is not only unfair, it’s pointless. Tying fines to income should be adopted in the U.S. for pretty much everything that fines apply to.
I'm fine with that....
+a bajillion. Anecdotally I know of a few people in the bay area who park illegally with regularity because parking enforcement where they are is spotty and they can just cover the fines without much problem.
Sensible. In addition to these measures, the US should require a health insurance plan which acknowledges and covers the lack of vaccination. And the proceeds from the fines should be used to fund free vaccinations for anyone who wants one.
Overall a nicely nuanced look at some very contentious data. That said, the scare quotes around “quasi-experimental” are a little off-putting. It’s a technical term in research and you don’t scare quite other terms of art in the article so it feels a little bit editorial to me... Sorry if that’s nit picky because it was otherwise a very good article as always.
""We're not sure if it caused more suicides"" still isn't great news for Netflix. Maybe don't renew this one again? It's not like there's a real lack of content being put out.
Netflix has already started scripting and shooting 14 Reasons Why.
So... People who are already suicidal watch a show and then kill themselves are presumed to be motivated by the show to kill themselves? I think this newer study lacks even the horribly limited relevance of the study from a month ago, since they didn't even bother to find out if anyone WATCHED the show. Maybe it was just a shitty year for kids in general and there's no correlation at all. TBH, from the sound of things, that's what I'd conclude. It sounds to me like they had a theory and cherry-picked ""facts"" to support it, instead of drawing conclusions based on the facts. Because the facts don't really lend themselves to any definitive conclusions, and the numbers seem to be suspiciously self-serving.
Well according to google ""94% liked this TV show"" With a rating like that its entirely likely it will be renewed. I scoff at the people who say violence in video games makes violent kids, and we need to curb content, but this is something that if further concluded I would understand to put behind some filters, or something. Its an interesting development that I will definitely followup on in additional reading, and probably watch the show honestly.

I never watched 13 Reasons Why. The trailers always made my skin crawl. Trashy teen exploitation drama should not be made around a girl's suicide.
Now we have live terrorism feeds in facebook while people are being killed in real time that cant be fully contained on the internet Apples and oranges kinda. We have a different culture, and standard for content which plays quite a bit into this. Also If there was an uptick of suicide in the 80s that correlated with a movie release it would be hard to quantify that back then, and even harder to spread the message. So i'd argue that there is an element of hyper awareness that we have as well in this millennia .
No.
Oh good, now we need to worry about the pony-posting contagion spreading. : /
It's difficult to attribute anything to a specific show without knowing how many of the eventual victims watched the show, or even knew it existed. A lot of other shows and movies approach this in various ways, discussing depression and all sorts of self-inflicted violence and self-destructive behavior. It's in the news, particularly when it involves a celebrity or someone involved in some other notable event (such as a few of the Parkland survivors in the past weeks). There's even a scene in Spoiler: show Infinity War where Gamora tries to kill herself, and one in Endgame where two characters have a brawl over which one of them gets to commit suicide. And, of course, Stark killing himself by using the stones. It's a topic worth studying and hopefully understanding, I'm just not convinced they've established any reliable link to a particular piece of media.
What is the disconnect that makes children vulnerable to watching a video, but impervious to playing the part in a video game?
Suicide is a difficult topic to discuss. The general consensus is that people who commit suicide are weak/inconsiderate/selfish people who would rather take the easy way out. After a suicide, people often make [defensive] comments such as ""I could have helped if only I'd known more!"" or ""why did they never tell anyone??""... they probably did. The reality is that most people do not actually want to clean up somebody else's (psychological) mess. Suicidal people know this. Even worse, we are so often told, in the name of self-improvement, to cut out Toxic things in our life. Makes sense... until Toxic becomes your black duckling friend who used to be so fun but now just rains sadness everywhere (or refuses to get help, etc).. what do many people do here? Feign compassion, and casually ignore the negativity until contact is seldom. Honestly, I'm afraid many of us are guilty of being Selfish here... I don't know what the answer to suicide is, but its not black & white - certainly not in a USA Healthcare System. Last edited by cosmotose on Thu May 02, 2019 4:34 pm
The significance of this show is that it promotes a particular understanding of suicide's causes and effects that is both inaccurate and extremely biased. In essence, unlike most popular media Thirteen Reasons Why provides justification and even glorification of the act of suicide in a highly personal and convincing fashion, despite being harmfully wrong in almost every respect. I mean, seriously, they consulted with actual experts who told Netflix that the show would be a destructive influence on the targeted teen audience, and they put it out anyways. THAT is why it has drawn widespread condemnation from psychiatrists and why it has been subjected to so much scrutiny.
The problem I find with this study is that the only thing even remotely tying the show to the deaths is the release date. Any event that happen on March 31, 2017 could be equality likely to have caused (or not caused) any of this. A quick google search shows that James Rosenquist, an American pop artist, died that day. So the study would be equality valid to claim that Rosenquist's death is to blame. That is not very plausible but the data is equality valid for both claims.
I wouldn't say scare quotes -- I'd say ""we are identifying this formalized term by enclosing it in quotation marks"". For what it's worth, as somebody who is not active in a field which uses this term, I'd say that quasi-experimental (that is, using the term without ever putting it in quotes) would make it sound much more dubious. Maybe a parenthetical, e.g. (we use quotation marks here because this is a phrase used in the scientific literature). YMMV.
That was my feeling too. Not saying Netflix doesn't have a right to make whatever they want, just that it seems sleazy and unethical. That said, I'm very leery of drawing any conclusions about cause and effect (sounds like the researchers were too).
Well, the first point against it is that there is now epidemiological evidence to suggest it did real damage. No one has yet produced a comparable study proving that videogames have any such effect. Maybe if someone made a videogame about how awesome suicide is we'd see that effect, but as far as I know there hasn't been any wide release of such a title.
I don't think this is an either-or sort of situation.
Also no.
""epidemiologist Jeff Bridge"" I read that ad Jeff Bridges the first time, went backed up, and realized it was NOT Bridges, just Bridge.
I would like to thank the author for reporting this news in the manner that she did. There are many other, more ""clickbaity"" ways that it could have been done. I appreciate the nuance and care. Edit to add another thought. To those who are saying ""popular media does not cause suicide"" I have this reply: Suicide is a way out of all of your problems when you cannot think of any other. Imagine you are a teenager (or adult) and your life's problems seem overwhelming. You have been doing your best, trying everything you can think of and you just cannot see a way out. Suddenly there is this thing reminding you do have a way out...yeah. The thing that really makes me emotional about this is that for many of these kids (or adults) there is another solution, but due to time, emotions, or circumstances, they just can't see it. Shows like this basically act as advertising. A McDonald's commercial won't drive you to eat a burger, but it sure as shit reminds you that it is an option when you are feeling hungry.

The other option is pokemon fanart.
Err.. I think the whole question & point of this article, IS trying to help on a large scale. On an individual level, have you ever tried helping someone who is Suicidal? Much easier to talk about than do. Do you have the Compassion/Strength to clean up somebody else's (psychological) Mess every week? every day? Without signs of improvement, I don't think most people do.
There is correlation for April, but causation is contraindicated by the rises in March (before the show aired), June and December. It makes as much sense to claim that 2017 rates rose because we are living in the darkest timeline under President Trump. His attacks on truth, justice and the American way could have driven more teens to commit suicide as they watched our alleged leader champion white supremacy and put children into cages.
So, they claim 13 Reasons Why was one cause of the increase in teen suicide. Did they ever find the other twelve reasons? I haven't watched the show but if I had to blame a piece of media for an increase in teen suicide, it would have to be Before I Fall, which came out on DVD on 30 May 2017. If you have seen the film (based on a book), you'll understand my comment. If you haven't seen the film and would like a spoiler, click the show button. Spoiler: show The main character in Before I Fall is a teen who finds herself living the same day over and over, Groundhog Day-style. However, it turns out that the only way to escape the time loop is to commit suicide. I'm not a psychologist, but showing that to teens who might feel like their lives are in a rut...may not be a particularly good message.
I'm certain that they worked to correct for it and that it's maybe somewhat mitigated by the focus on ""at risk"" rather than actively or successfully attempting, but I found the inherent survivorship bias in asking participants to self-report on suicide slightly amusing given the dark and personal subject matter.
Now if they had compared teen suicides to the political reporting at the time...
I don't remember regularly practicing to get shot in my classroom in the 80's. School life must have been very different for the OP.
Hmm.. They don't know if the suicidal teens watched the show just in case they still pin blame on it? I would like to know which Hollywood studio financed this research paper.
Yes, the old Nic Cage/Swimming Pool evidence. I'd be much more interested in some useful theories about the uptick being exclusively male. From http://tylervigen.com/view_correlation?id=359
Ever hear of ""Duck and Cover""? A generation of kids practiced to become shadows burned into the wall. Existential dread is ever present.
Who will be the first to offer measles-party cruises to the antivaxxers?

Does that also mean that we can keep them out to sea indefinitely?

Good.
I wonder how long it’ll be before other countries start imposing travel bans or pre-travel requirements on Americans—such as requiring vaccination records to get entry clearance. Other countries don’t want our diseases.
Most countries already have vaccination travel certificate requirements.
A long, long time before we see any serious ""bans."" There are many nations still grappling with measles infections.
Ship of Fools, indeed.
Keep them there till good ol' Ron rises from the waves, takes away their measles, gives them the 7th Theton status and goes back under the waves!
Nice to see that even wacky religious cults can have their own cruise ships now. Isn't the 21st century wonderful? Unfortunately, there is never a rogue U-boat around when you really need one.

A cruise ship with perhaps a large proportion of unvaccinated adults (and children). 400 people crammed together with no where to go. A TV crew is winched down to the deck. Reality TV for 21st Century. Could make The Poseidon Adventure seem like a Disney flick.
Last I checked the offending ingredient, mercury, was eliminated many years ago from vaccines, and as such even if there was any link to autism before, there won't be any at all now. So not getting vaccinated at this point is just horse shit. Or of course some fetus that never lived is the reason.
To be fair, France did just open their borders to a whole bunch of people from a poor and war-torn region of the world.
7.2 billion and counting, no one would miss a few ships full of people selfishly bent of harming others through their self inflicted stupidity.
Since September, Madagascar has reported over 67,000 cases of measles out of a population of ~25.5 million (equivalent to ~857,000 cases in the US).

Well the Schadenboner is going to mean I may have to work from home.
How we have arrived at a point where people think it is safer to put themselves at risk of acquiring a deadly disease as opposed to being vaccinated against it is beyond me. And the fact they're so irresponsible for themselves it's jeopardizing the lives of others to the point of criminal negligence is even more ridiculous.
I’m not sure which countries “most” refers to, as I’ve been able to travel to a number of countries and I’ve have never had to produce my vaccination records. I know for certain I can enter multiple EU nations without them, and once I’m in the Schengen Area, that’s 26 different nations I can move about freely in without any additional paperwork. Maybe I’ve just coincidentally always visited countries without such requirements? But that doesn’t seem right to me.

How does that explain the measles outbreaks in France in 2008 and 2011?

I rescind my benefit of the doubt. I didn't know the French were stupid.
It’s multi-national, sure. But the US used to be the world leader on vaccines and disease eradication efforts, and (like other areas of science where the US is rapidly retreating) I expect international response to put pressure on the US not to regress. I was going to object to calling it a “global” problem since measles was eradicated across Latin America, and the epidemic in Venezuela is attributable to the collapse of their government and its healthcare system, not vaccine attitudes. But that doesn’t explain the over 1,000 cases in Brazil in 2018 and hundreds of cases elsewhere across the continent. Sigh. There goes my optimism.

Vaccination requirements (if any) are usually tied to visa issuance so if you can travel without a visa it is unlikely there will be a restriction other than a temporary emergency measure. This generally means ""first world nations"" are largely not restricted because you can travel from the US to most of Europe without a visa and vice versa. Vaccination requirements for visa issuance can also depend on the country of origin. If your passport was issued by Sudan you can bet most countries will require vaccination records as part of issuing you an entry visa. Of course all of this is largely outdated thinking based on the logic that nobody would intentionally subject their children to measles or other preventable disease and thus vaccination rates in first world nations would largely eradicate the disease. That was true for 20 years or so but increasingly is not. Last edited by Statistical on Thu May 02, 2019 9:24 am

But think of the (stockholder's) children!
Well, today I learned that antivenin is a word. I also learned not to get bitten by a snake.
Quote: But they may seem like weak nips after the hospital’s billing department sinks their teeth in. Ah, I love the Beth Mole writing. Quote: Though it’s a straightforward process, relatively few people end up needing an antivenin of any kind—less than 50,000 per year in the country. And that leads to steep prices. So to lower prices, we need more venomous snake bites on the population - particularly small children?
But... but... regulatory standards that would prevent such predatory price gouging would be (dun dun DUNNN) SOCIALISM!
America: If you can't afford medication, you are an inferior specimen and don't deserve to live. Rest of the developed world: o_0
I've had this same experience. I was working at a Boy Scout camp as a teenager and got bitten by a copperhead. The staff paramedic drove me down to the nearby rural hospital where they administered treatment. A one-night in-patient stay with three courses of antivenin over 12 hours had an invoice of 65,000 dollars. Of that, 54,000 was JUST the antivenin. I didn't even get an ambulance ride! Lucky me, workman's comp covered it since I was an employee of the camp. Oh, and a fun fact: you can generally only use an animal-type of antivenin once. Next go-round, expect serious allergic reactions. The horse-based variety will even cause severe reactions the first time around in some cases.

The often-used line about ""don't worry about the price because insurance pays for it"" is pure BS. And who is it that pays for the insurance? It isn't as though the money appears out of thin air. Gouging is gouging.
Yet another example of why Capitalism and Healthcare should be anathema, not bedfellows. The health and wellbeing of the population would be the first interest of the state, in a more perfect world.
Support healthcare reform by swallowing whole rattlesnakes? I can get behind that.
American voters are chumps; they can only blame themselves.
Indeed, the whole system is set out to bankrupt people.
Our for profit healthcare system is far more predatory than that snake
Come the fuck on. Normal people pay the premiums.
So. Many. Things.   ... so US taxpayer money via NIH or similar was used to develop an antivenin in a University that cannot control or limit its costs in the commercial sector, and produce profit+ in the for-profit healthcare system? Of course. This is America. Next time get the Helivac to take you south over the border, will be cheaper. Edit: typo, not take you 'out' but take you 'south'. Both would be cheaper, tbh Last edited by marcopolomint on Tue Apr 30, 2019 11:53 am
As a representative of the dairy industry, please refrain from using this term and use the preferred ""manufacturers drain snakes"" instead. /s
American freedom. The freedom to end up broke because of a snake bite. What a shitty country.
It's shameful. My daughter had a 6mm thorn that was lodged just 2mm below the surface of the skin removed from the top of her foot following a trip to South Africa. The treatment comprised of trips to a local family physician, 3 visits to a surgeon, an ultrasound, radiology, and eventually a totally overblown surgery including general anesthesia and post op care - total cost $9800. For a thorn. The final nail in the coffin was the bit where I finally blew my top and reamed the hospital a new one after they indicated the thorn had been sent to pathology for diagnosis.
Did you have insurance? This is why. I broke my thumb once. Hospital for that was $30k...because I had insurance....
Most snake bites occur between the knee and ankle. Also shoes made of anything but cowhide will do dick-all to stop a snake fang. They're basically hypodermic needles.
For-profit healthcare strikes me as incredibly myopic. In an admittedly very simplified view of it: A healthy population is a productive workforce. A productive workforce creates more value than the profit from the healthcare industry. I especially can't understand the practice of charging exorbitant fees for labour and delivery. After all, that's the next generation of workforce. (Disclosure: I work in the healthcare industry outside of the United States.)
That wouldn't work at all. Just look t the cash price of insulin: 2002: one months supply of Lantus/Humulog - about $50. 2018: one months supply of Lantus/Humulog - about $1,500 Literally your money or your life
I'm normally very opposed to the ridiculous efforts people undertake to make an acronym fit their purpose. But I have to let this one slide.
This is so very true. It's not like you can show up at the ER and look at a list of prices for what's about to be done and then decide if this is the place for you. This bullshit about consumer driven healthcare is just that, the very same procedure done at one hospital can have a completely different price at another hospital in the same town, by multiples in fact. Then trying to figure out what's in network vs out of network, and many ER's are out of network these unless your state has laws preventing it. My wife spent about 20 hours in the ER in California after a high blood pressure incident that came on suddenly, they did an ultrasound, a blood draw, an xray and 3 urine samples and the final bill to the insurance was $55k for that. The urine tests were some $6k each. That hit our max out of pocket deductible in one go for that year, $5500 was what we had to pay off after. How in any sane world does any politician look at this and think, yep this is a good system.
I've dealt with reptiles practically my entire adult life. You *will* get bitten, due almost *entirely* to your own carelessness. Reptiles have a hard wired set of ""triggers"" for when they will bite. Don't cross that line, you won't get bitten. Cross it, even a millimeter, and you will (or be fast enough to get missed) It's part and parcel to handling reptiles. Some bites are no big deal (royal pythons) others are a real problem (adult monitors) and of course venomous snakes are a whole other issue, as shown in this article. This is why I won't handle venomous reptiles. I can't afford the consequences.
All this gouging for drugs would vanish if we were to let people legally buy from the countries on either side of us.
>>How in any sane world does any politician look at this and think, yep this is a good system.<< Politicians are rich, or in the pocket of rich people, so they wouldn't even blink at that price, so to them it's a sound system because everyone associate with is rich like them so no problem...
This is the primary defect in this country's for-profit health care sector: some people want to shriek ""free market!"" and try to apply market behaviors to something that is not and can never be a free market. Nobody wants to go to the hospital, and when something happens like a snakebite or a car crash or even a broken arm, few people can actually choose which hospital they go to. When people get a job, they don't actually have any options for what insurance to get; they get the company plan or, in most cases, nothing.
Mexico has MOAR SNAKES!
Any drug that a person needs to survive is a potential target for price gouging. This is the grim reality of a for-profit healthcare system; it's not illegal to extort sick people. Rather, it is encouraged. So when will the media take a stand on this issue, and demand that our representatives enact single payer? Does Ars realize that their readers (and their associated ad clicks) could slowly disappear as the general population gets sicker and poorer?
Oh no they do pay for it. However the problem the Hospital and Doctors have is that they only get paid about %25-50 of the published service cost. For example lets compare it with another industry. Lets say you code at $100 per hour on a contract job. And there was a Coding Insurance company. You' be paid $25 per hour because of the Negotiated insurance payout. So to get paid that $100. You have to jack up your prices to $400 just to make what you want. This is why how insurance companies cause the medical industry to jack up the retail prices.
These days, I can literally purchase an airplane ticket to Mexico and a one months supply of insulin there cheaper than to just buy the same insulin here. Last edited by el_oscuro on Tue Apr 30, 2019 12:06 pm
Yeah, and the insurance company says fuck that, this stuff costs x and you'll be happy with that amount. Then what may happen is you still pay the difference. But according to Charlie Kirk we have got the best healthcare system!
Yeah and you can’t exactly shop around during a medical emergency. Either you get prompt treatment or you die. Also unless you have a medical degree and knowledge of medical billing, chances are you have no idea what needs to be done and what it should cost.
The stupidity of fear and ignorance
Can we please stop fucking around and make the spread of these lies about vaccines illegal? This isn't ""free speech"" - it's directly harmful speech that causes illness, maiming, and death.
Wonder what happened in 1994, and what happened again in 2014. But wow, '94 was rough.
Maybe Kentucky governor Matt Bevin can go to UCLA's campus with his kids, and they can all have a big Measles party!
I can't find words to express how angry this makes me. If this was a resurgence due to the measles evolving so as to make the vaccine ineffective, that would suck, but that's life (literally). To know that this was preventable and parents simply chose not to protect their children is incomprehensible to me. I was thrilled to learn that there was an effective chicken pox vaccine available so that my child wouldn't need to suffer through that like I did, and even happier that the HPV vaccine came along (because who doesn't want to prevent penis cancer?! (I know, not technically correct)). Vaccines and antibiotics are absolute miracles of medicine, and we're busy throwing them away. I can't even begin to understand.
The US is fast transforming into a post-capitalist plutocracy, run by populist oligarchs, fuelled by religious zeoliotry and corporate controlled conservative pundits.
Same thing we're seeing now. Although an effective vaccine was available, its use wasn't widespread. What's notable about 1994 is how cases plummeted afterward, following the introduction of subsidized vaccinations. Vaccines prevent disease. They can, in the case of human-only diseases like measles, be the route to completely eradicating those diseases. The government needs to step up here, instead of holding hands with those spreading FUD.
It's like you've bought into every right wing conservative radio talkshow host talking points. These outbreaks are from conspiracy nuts (ie. Regular Americans) refusing to vaccinate their children. It has nothing to do with immigration.
We're doing our best to initiate our own analogue to the Fall of Rome.
Good idea, but you can't prosecute a sitting president. Donald Trump Has Long Linked Autism to Vaccines. He Isn’t Stopping Now That He’s President. http://fortune.com/2017/02/16/donald-tr ... -vaccines/
You need to watch Star Wars again, they highlight the ramifications of stupidity and ignorance pretty well. I believe they are referring to the stupidity and ignorance of parents who choose not to vaccinate their kids because they read some bad ""science"". If you are offended, then you should probably get your kids vaccinated.
I think you mean Jenny McCarthy.
Bullshit. Trying to pin these outbreaks on illegal immigration is particularly laughable. It's been pointed out to you when you've tried to spread this bilge before that none of the current outbreaks have this as a cause; they are all tied directly to legal travel from Europe and Israel, either by tourists and visa holders or by Americans returning from those areas. Mexico and most central and south American countries, in fact, have HIGHER vaccination rates than the US currently does; it's those countries who should live in fear of filthy, disease-ridden Americans spreading various plagues, rather than your fictional inverse.
What is sad is that Ellis Island was handling 5000 people a day at it's peak, and there were more people coming through at other ports of entry (only 1/4 of my ancestors arriving at that time came through Ellis). Our more sophisticated current system can't seem to manage to handle half that number spread across multiple ports of entry. Back then we were willing to hire people to handle the issue. If only we were willing to put a little money into hiring more administrative support personnel, lawyers, and judges, we might be able to handle our current load too.
Ignorance is alive and well out there. It is up to those that embrace science, truth, and enlightenment to turn the tide and to civilization back to ""normal"". Obviously, we've seen the ebb and flow of ignorance in the past (just ask Galileo, Copernicus, et al). Today ignorance is exceedingly dangerous due to the modern miracles of international travel, and how easily diseases like measles can be spread. Let's all buckle-down and do our part to turn this tide; think globally, act locally.
I'm aware of that. Hell, even ""doctor"" Herman Cain was ringing the anti-vax bell during the last primaries. Today, Trump appeared to reverse himself and started promoting vaccinations, and I'll acknowledge that as a good and significant thing - for as long as it lasts. Which I suspect will be minutes, but I won't gainsay it just because of that.
I'm not that old, but I have a permanently dislocated rib from pertusis (whooping cough) from when I was a kid... I don't think a vaccine was available then. It is ironic that success in eradicating these dangerous diseases has led to a false sense of security with parents who have never seen a kid with measles, etc. I also worry that this measles outbreak will, in fact, not wake up recalcitrant parents to the fact they are assholes for not vaccinating their kids, because the fatality rate for measles is relatively low. It might, unfortunately, take something much more dangerous, like a smallpox outbreak.
It's a reproduction of an old CDC graph. I've seen it before; since it's in the public domain, it pops up a lot. It's a nice illustration of the effectiveness of vaccines.

It marked the start of the federally-funded “Vaccines for Children” program, which provides vaccines at no cost to children whose parents or guardians may not otherwise be able to afford them.
Was talking to my sister, who lives in Brooklyn, the other day, and she said this about my 10 month nephew: ""Also we vaccinated Aron early today for MMR on account of the measles outbreak in BK - super scary !"" While I applaud her being a conscientious mother, it really makes me angry that she had to bump the vaccination schedule up because of these ignorant people who refuse to understand basic science. It's not about you, or your children, it's about everyone. That's how these diseases work. To borrow a phrase that seems apt right now, ""fuck your feelings"".
In this context ... Ignorance - can refer to a lack of facts, or it can refer to a willful state of mind to avoid them. Fear - is an impulse that clouds reason. It also drives one to try to protect themselves (or family) over the welfare others. Stupidity - is a combination of the above that allows people to justify their belief in conspiracy and be sucked into sharing it. Edit: deleted repeated word.

Thank you for articulating a scenario even worse than the one we're currently in. Losing the eastern seaboard because of Jenny McCarthy's stupidity would certainly put a bow on the last couple of years.
Considering her warped sense of humor and her ill temper they're probably the same entity.
Maybe re-framing anti-vax as a big pharma conspiracy to increase profits by bringing back previously eliminated diseases would be more effective then presenting them with facts and logic.
Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death. We can do things about the first three. We insist on shooting ourselves in the foot repeatedly.
We are a bunch of apes regulated more by our brain stem and our hypothalamus than actual reason. Fuck. I just hope my kid makes it out of the toddler stage before I have to punch an anti-vaxxer.

kerosion wrote: Vaccination provides resistance. In multi-shot immunizations you see these referred to percentage resistance with each shot, 45%, 85%, 98% after full immunization. That resistance declines with time, or from impaired immune system. When these outbreaks occur many who catch the disease were vaccinated. The advantage of widespread vaccination is containment when an outbreak does occur, it's less likely to spread as far. This is just wrong. Although a small number of vaccinated people will still get measles, saying it’s “many” or implying outbreaks regularly occur even with measles vaccination is just plain wrong. The advantage of widespread vaccination is herd immunity, which is sufficient vaccination rates to prevent an “outbreak” from taking hold in the first place. From the CDC: Quote: The recent outbreaks started through importation. Measles is imported when an unvaccinated traveler visits a country where there is widespread measles transmission, gets infected with measles, and returns to the United States and exposes people in a community who are not vaccinated. When measles is imported into a community with a highly vaccinated population, outbreaks either don’t happen or are usually small. However, once measles is in an under-vaccinated community, it becomes difficult to control the spread of the disease. kerosion wrote: Concurrently we're on track to see the highest yearly immigration into the US on record. Washington Post and other reporting outlets have described our services are overwhelmed. At Ellis Island as immigrants came through we had system to contain and observe for disease before entering into the general population. Today we're much more sophisticated however I do not see much attention on how the unprecedented influx impacts ability to screen vaccinations of those coming into our country through catch and release. Assurance that a vaccination review is performed before release would be comforting. Oh good, the racism. No, this is not due to Mexican and Central American people coming here. We do actually know where it’s coming from, and it’s not them. Per the CDC, the 2018 NY/NJ measles outbreaks impacting Orthodox Jewish communities began with a traveler to Israel, which was battling a measles outbreak at the time. The 2015 Anaheim outbreak is believed to have originated from an international visitor to Disneyland, and the strain matched a measles outbreak that spread through the Philippines in 2014. 2014 outbreaks impacting Amish communities also originated from the Philippines. In 2011, measles was introduced to the U.S. a number of times by travelers from France during a French measles outbreak. It’s typically tourism, not immigration or asylum seeking, that brings measles to the U.S. from foreign soil. Your attempt to link these outbreaks to immigration (particularly Central American asylum seekers, the people you refer to as “coming into our country through catch and release”) is just unfounded and rooted purely in bias and hatred. P.S. As the CATO Institute has helpfully demonstrated, mandatory vaccination programs have ensured that overall vaccination rates in Mexico and Central America are at least equal to (and in some cases higher than) in the U.S. So take your dirty immigrant stereotype and shove it.
Possible, but I'm pretty certain Cain was running his mouth about vaccines and how they shouldn't be used. Maybe it was just at the same time, or maybe it was Carson. In any case, that anti-vax bullshit has now become a fashionable political stance is all kinds of terrifying and depressing.
I've got $5 down on the anti-vaxxers using this as ""proof"" that vaccines don't work.
But they already try to frame it as ""Big Pharma Makes Billion$ on Vaccines and We Don't Need Them"". Of course, logical consistency has never been a hallmark of conspiracy theorists.
Given that vaccines are lifesaving and provide the greatest benefit when administered widely, it is disturbing to me that it took until 1994 to make them available at no cost to low income families. They should be mandatory, at no cost to everyone. What the fuck is wrong with this country.
It's good to see finally something coming out. It would be interesting to have an more in depth article as to why it took so long to get a partially effective vaccine and what the problems were in its development.
Are there any concerns with side effects, did the trials reveal any concerns on that front? I'll be honest if not I don't really see the down side here, sure it isn't nearly as effective as we would like but if you can save even a few lives it seems worth it to try.
It's certainly not ideal, but it's better than nothing. I hope.
Do you have a link for your ""Immune System specialization problems""? This is a parasite, not a virus. What are these ""unsuspected consequences of efficient medication""? Antibiotics are having an issue because people are too stupid to take the full course of treatment, and our regulators that are too goddamn stupid to say no, you may not add antibiotics to soap, mouthwash, random farm animals that are not sick, farmed fish, etc.
There are, technically other options for prophylaxis. However they are quite expensive, have side effects, and must be taken daily or weekly indefinitely. So not really an option to fight it long term. Now if malaria were a human-centric disease where we were the target and the source, it'd be one thing. But mosquitoes don't just contract it from humans, and so there's no option to just mass treat with prophylaxis and wait it out. If I remember, it's not even just in the mosquito population either, it's in some animals as a source of reinfection to the mosquito population. There's been some noise about eradicating the particular species of mosquito that is the carrier (pedant: actually definitive host. sexual reproduction occurs in the mosquito and asexual in the human), to stop transmission, but that's not having unexpected consequences, that's the carpet bombing without knowing what's also there method of fighting disease
I’ve spent the last decade in malaria prevention so a few comments: Saving lives directly is only a small part of the benefit of averted cases. In many places like Malawi where malaria is endemic it’s such a large part of the caseload at rural clinics that averting 40% of cases in this demographic will be the difference between the health system being totally overwhelmed and being able to function normally and treat everything else in their portfolio. I’ve seen rural clinics in the height of malaria season where 95% of all patients were malaria and patients were sleeping outside for lack of beds - it’s hard to treat anything else in that situation. Secondly, while it hasn’t been well modeled there are many malariologists (myself included) who suspect that the reduction in malaria may be more than 40% when an entire population is vaccinated. While this isn’t a “transmission blocking” vaccine per se, anything that lowers the number of parasites in the blood lowers the probability of onward transmission. In none of the previous trials was there this level of blanket coverage. Thirdly, there are a couple of very promising follow ups to RTS,S. One is simply RTS,S with a more effective adjuvant. So one way of thinking of this trial is that it’s a trial of a platform for malaria vaccine delivery generally not just a trial of RTS,S specifically. If health systems can effectively get the vaccine out there then any follow-on vaccines can simply drop into an existing delivery system which will speed up their roll-out. Lastly, in the section on “first” I think you’re missing the biggest one - this is the first vacccine against a parasite. These are organisms that are an order of magnitude larger and dramatically more complex than bacteria and many orders of magnitude more complex than the viruses that most vaccines target. The number of proteins expressed on the parasites cell wall is many times larger than the number on a bacteria or virus capsule and is coded by a variable region in the parasites DNA. This really is a tremendous scientific advance in addition to being a public health milestone.
I suspect that It Depends. Vaccines aren't like antibiotics(in the sense that they prime the immune system to target and kill rather than exploit a vulnerable bit of biochemistry that the pathogen has and the patient doesn't); so it may or may not be possible for the pathogen to evolve into an immunologically unrecognized form(if there are already strains that are, but not common, I'd assume that it definitely can and will fairly quickly; if the target is something the plasmodium can't as readily reshuffle it may be more difficult); and there's also the question of how fast the vaccine can be tweaked(flu is the notorious example of something where vaccines lose efficacy basically all the time; but respinning a modest variant for this year's expected strain is usually something people are able to do quickly and successfully, unlike the sometimes decades long and often less than exciting antibiotic R&D case.) Herd immunity and presence or absence of animal hosts would be the other big thing: even tepid levels if immunity can have knock-on improvements(non-infected humans don't turn mosquitos that bite them into carriers, fewer carrier mosquitos means fewer infectious bites in unvaccinated or unprotected people, who are then also less likely to be infected and infect mosquitos). I'd be interested to know what the epidemiologists say about minimum levels of efficacy/vaccination rate/etc. required to disrupt enough transmissions that even a deeply imperfect vaccine can expect to cause the number of infected mosquitos and expected malaria exposures to start spiraling down; but unless there's an inconvenient animal that also gets malaria and infects mosquitos there likely is a level where enough infections are interrupted that most people simply never end up being exposed, which makes the effective value of the vaccine much higher. 30%-ish is way too low to be good for prophylactic travel medicine go-into-malarial-hellhole-and-be-fine stuff(though probably still worth using just because 1/3 is better than nothing and antimalarial prophylactic drugs are not a pleasant bunch as it is); but may well be good enough to see synergistic effects in a vaccinated population(as well as at least reducing the amount of morbidity and mortality and the economic burden of illness and so improving the ability of the society to function and care for those who do fall ill). Given the current options, it's pretty exciting. (Plus, do autistic mosquitos even bite people?)
Do you mind explaining what is the basis of this vaccine. Why does the protein, if it is a protein, get the immune system to work when the normal immune reaction won't clear the system.
I don't think keying the immune system up to fight off the invader (ie using a vaccine) works the same as sticking something in you that attacks the invader directly (ie using an antibiotic).
My take was that once it gets into the liver, the parasite is relatively safe, and the immune system only has a short period between initial infection and arrival at the liver. Given time, the immune system could react and attack the parasite, and “priming” it with a chunk of protein accelerates that reaction, improving its chances to do so before that window has closed.
Well your body actually can clear the infection provided you’re someone who has been infected over and over again since childhood (a.k.a. anyone who has lived in a highly endemic area from childhood) and gained some degree of acquired immunity. The best way to think of vaccines is not that they’re making the body do something it wouldn’t do otherwise, it’s just making the body do what it would do anyways faster! When the body encounters the CS protein (part of the sporozoite form of the parasite’s cell wall) it mobilizes to attack it. The more times the body has seen that particular protein the faster it attacks. And this matters because the parasite is only in the sporozoite form for a few hours before it heads to the relatively immunoprivelidged area of the liver and hides out. If you can, with a vaccine, speed up the body’s natural reaction to the CS protein so that it kills off the parasite BEFORE it gets to the liver, then you’ve protected that individual.
I knew that malaria was prolific and killed lots of people every year but I had no idea that malaria killed that many people. I also did not know that there was a middle ground for vaccines; I thought they were typically 95% effective or higher or they were failures and not rolled out. Yes, given the number of annual cases and deaths, which if we apply 39% success rate to, 200 million cases and 435,000 deaths could start to be lowered by 78 million cases and 169,650 deaths in a theoretical ""magic wand to make enough vaccines and distribute them to everyone"" scenario,"" I hope the results of this go well. And thanks to wrylachlan for some additional insight.
An imperfect solution now is better than a perfect solution in twenty years.
Great initiative, hope its a success.
I absolutely agree with everything you've said, and want to highlight the achievement that RTS,S represents (though it could have been given a more consumer-focused drug name...). I also worked in malaria-control, briefly, about ten years ago, and so wanted to add some thoughts. Malaria is a parasite for which humans are the primary host. (There are some malaria variants with animal reservoirs, but these are rare and mostly confined to South East Asia.) Mosquitos are important in shifting the disease from one person to another, but their lifespan is several weeks and is not long enough to make them a continual reservoir of the disease. Because of this, if we're able to interrupt the disease in humans we can eliminate the disease in a location, and potentially eradicate it globally in a future decade. We currently have drugs that are effective at clearing the disease when an infection occurs, which not only helps that person but dramatically reduces the transmission of the disease to another person. What a 39% reduction in human infection represents is a further reduction in the local transmission of that disease. With the use of this vaccine and other tools (including; bednets, indoor spraying, education so that people seek help and take malaria medicine consistently) we have the chance to beat back malaria where it is currently prevalent. That's tremendously exciting. I've been out of the field for a while now though, so wrylachlan might have more to say on this topic.
This seems to be something that would be effective in conjunction with a mosquito solution. We wiped out 1/2 the world's species, what is one more? http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/biodivers ... diversity/
For real, only females bite, with the higher threat being anti-vaxx mosquito moms.
DDT is still a WHO-approved chemical for malaria control. It's not widely used, in part because of ongoing issues with resistance, but also because of issues with human health. It is rightly banned from use in agriculture, because it is a bioaccumulative harmful substance. But its use in agriculture also has the effect of hastening and increasing resistance in mosquitos, weakening its potential application in controlling malaria and other diseases.
uh... wrong on so many levels... Firstly DDT was never banned for malaria prevention use and is in fact still used in a few countries. However... it doesn’t work very well anymore because the mosquitos have developed resistance. Which is why it isn’t used in more countries. In fact that resistance cropped up in the 1950s so this particular conspiracy story has been demonstrably wrong for going on 70 years now.
And even though DDT itself is banned in agriculture there are other pesticides used in agriculture (the pyrethroid class) whose mechanism of action is sufficiently similar to that of DDT that their use selects for DDT resistance.
Malaria is a fascinating parasite, with a ton of mechanisms for avoiding host immune response. One is that unlike many infectious diseases malaria has a life cycle, and as the parasite moves through the life cycle and in response to environmental factors the parasite SHIFTS PROTEIN EXPRESSION on its surface. This means that for any specific part of the life cycle your immune system is only getting exposed to a subset of proteins at a time, which your immune system isn't particularly good at managing. It also does other things, most notably hiding inside of cells and manipulating cell activity to minimize host immune reaction. It's not surprising it's extremely difficult to create treatments/immunizations for it, it's very well adapted to living with our immune system.
Will be interesting how this turns out as malaria is a major cause of mortality so even a suboptimal vaccine can result in quite some lives saved. However, there are some caveats with this vaccine. In previous trials, vaccine efficacy waned significantly in 4 years. And in a smaller study with 7 years follow-up, there were indications of a higher risk of malaria in children exposed to high levels of parasites 5 years after vaccination (with a 3-dose regimen, not the above descibed 4-dose regimen).

Going through medical school and then working in hospitals, you’re obviously required to have up to date vaccinations. I’ve had the MMR 4 times in my life now (once as a child, and 3 times as an adult for school/work), and each time I got checked, I didn’t have any antibodies. It sucks knowing that I’m one of the 3% that hasn’t been able to trigger immunity to measles, and therefore depend on other people to be vaccinated to keep me safe. Fortunately where I live there haven’t been any outbreaks... yet. I hate this anti-vaccination bullshit.
It will be really interesting to see what the real world use impact is with a vaccine that is really in a middle ground as far as effective and not effective goes.
No.
Malaria isn't a virus. It is a protozoan parasite, more similar to a bacteria than a virus.
Thanks for your reply, I didn't know about the hiding out in the liver.
DDT is not used wantonly because of its secondary effects. It not only killed harmful insects, but also the beneficial insects, including pollinators. Even more important was how it also reduced the bird population which also fed on adult insects and fish that fed on larvae. although DDT is classed as a level 2 carcinogen, it is not considered very toxic to humans. When DDT is used today, it is used to specifically target areas rather than as the blanket approach used 1945 to 1975. It remains a primary form of malaria control in most parts of the world.

No. Placebo is when you treat with known neutral agent (for example homeopatic products). People treated with placebo gets malaria more often then those treated this vaccine. That's the bar that needs to be cleared for all medicine. Not some arbitrary number but against parallel trial with placebo. This vaccine needs pilot period to see how doable its for local communities to vaccine kids at right age at right intervals enough times. 40% success rate could mean 40% less cases, more capacity for treating other conditions, more able bodied humans to treat epidemies and extra safety for relief workers. On top of that 95% heard immunity threshold is based on mode of infection where Every infected will have chance to infect Every other met person. However here infection mode is through secondary vector, that may be well below everybody-to-everybody.
Is it possible the (relatively) low efficacy rate is because the vaccine only uses falciparum proteins and isn't (as) effective against malariae, ovale, or vivax? IIRC, falciparum is the most lethal of the four and thus a good place to start, but could future vaccines include other strains and improve the overall immunity rate?
Close but not exactly. Firstly, DDT’s targeted use through what’s called indoor residual spraying (small doses applied to the interior walls of dwellings) actually predates it’s use for aerial spraying. So your implication that we’ve changed our approach since 1975 is off the mark. It’s public health use in Africa has been pretty consistently indoor residual spraying NOT aerial spraying for a very very long time. Indoor residual spraying with DDT precursor chemicals actually goes back to the 1920s. And secondly there’s really nowhere left in the world where DDT is the primary form of malaria control. There are a few places that still use it, but they’re pretty rare and even sourcing DDT is getting increasingly difficult.
I think there's a lot of potential around adjuvants and drugs for co-administration. There are several drug and nutrient categories that have big impacts on killing of intracellular pathogens and subsequent antigen display which when combined with a vaccine could potentially make a big difference.
I know the critics don't want to lose the talent, but it sounds like they kind of already have, in a way. They now work for China and everything they do is meant to help China using US federal grant money. China can have their IP spies back. I've known plenty of non-spies who do ground breaking work.
On the one hand, I get being concerned about China stealing military secrets and using technology for oppression, but on the other hand...fuck cancer. Make all the research public to help fuel the fight. (I know the potential to monetize a cure for cancer is the main driving force of the research, but sometimes you gotta point out the imperfections in the system)
Make the results from research public? Sure, public grants paid for much of that science. Make the proposals to do the research public? No, not if you want people to do the actual research. Especially since the funding rate for grants is below 15% and may even be in the single digits. These scientists got canned for violating the basic ethics of the profession: You don't disclose what's in the proposals.
In the long run, China is shooting it's self in the foot. Eventually no one will trust any of them.
But China won't share their results unless it suits them. It is a lot less transparent than other countries. That's the concern with China's space efforts.
No one cares as long as the price is cheap, the product is adequate enough, and no one has to see the how the sausage is made.
Cons of working in the tech industry: You keep thinking the abbreviation ""IP"" stands for ""Internet Protocol"" only and not its second meaning, ""Intellectual Property"".
Maybe a dumb question, but... why not? Why is it basic ethics to keep a scientific proposal confidential? (I mean, besides disobeying a prior agreement or NDA.)
Would someone mind explaining what a ""shadow lab"" is precisely ?
Any reference for this extraordinary claim ?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qian_Xues ... ted_States It's common knowledge in academia.
Canis domesticus maybe?
I disagree with that statement, especially from the researchers' point of view. (I can't speak for their employers, of course).
100% this. Critical medical research (IE anything that cures/save/extends lives) should be public domain. There is still plenty of money in boner pills and boob jobs.
Grant money is often awarded according to which proposals are new, ambitious, exciting, and/or exploring promising areas that nobody else has thought of before. If your proposals are leaked to other research groups, then a situation of ""well, we can't fund this proposal right now, but the idea shows promise and we might fund a revised version"" becomes ""well, we decline to fund this proposal, because there are already two other groups doing the same thing"".
Noun Canis domesticus m (obsolete) A taxonomic species within the family Canidae – the domesticated dog. Usage notes: This name was never adopted, and so is invalid. Synonym: Canis lupus familiaris.
There is an awful lot of work that goes into these proposals. Years of work. Think of them as a patent application of the older type where you can go build out the device from the description. If you are given this detailed roadmap and then you sneak it over to China where the so called 'shadow lab' can try to beat you to the punch. It is truly intellectual property.
Thats why its a ""shadow""...
I wish this was just a Chinese problem. Generally, the more competitive, prestigious, and money-laden a research field is, the more you see these ethical lapses. I'm the first to blame the Chinese government when they're acting badly, but particularly oncology research (because of the massive amounts of money) seems to be rife with this kind of bad faith activity regardless of ethnicity or country of origin. I would point people to this series from ProPublica describing the bad-faith activity of senior cancer hospital leaders (https://www.propublica.org/series/sloan ... ers-crisis)
Chinese labs might also be trying to finish their version of the research first then patent it, stealing the revenue from the US researchers.
It's not ""paranoia"" when the researchers have been caught stealing IP and setting up shadow labs in China.

Wonder who the down voters are because this is absolutely true. The US has been selling it's own ass out for decades now to placate the plebes and keep the house of cards ""consume consume consume"" economy going with cheap labor/ goods. Who cares about doing business with dictators (except when it's little countries you can push around for political points like Cuba) when there's cash to be made?
And losing the IP doesn't? This is a really bad argument cited at the end of the article.
You're ignoring the work (with costs in time and money) that went on before they reached the point of writing up a proposal, the work of writing the proposal itself, and the benefits from continuing to fund future work by those people. IP theft allows a lab in China to get the benefit from months or years of paid work by US researchers for a fraction of the cost. If they manage to keep the US researchers from getting funded by beating them to the punch, the people who actually came up with the ideas and research plan lose their funding to continue their work. You sound like the people who say ""get rid of all IP laws and let everyone compete based on how they use the IP."" For companies like Nvidia that pour hundreds of millions into GPU research, the long-term results would be an end to that research. If anyone else can use the results of their work for free, those companies can keep Nvidia from charging enough to recover their R&D costs.
What do you mean ""eventually""?
Yes, but this is how ""free trade"" works Beth. You see, China sells us their goods for somewhere near the pennies that we buy off the shelves so that our CEOs profit and get rich and in return China decides what innovations they're going to ""collect"" from US to continue the ""innovation process"" on their side. Sure American innovation gets killed in the process, but the upside is that it enables the majority of us to become bigger ""consumerists"" than we could ever dream of. Who wins, who loses, you decide. It's all for the ""greater good"" as they say. Last edited by Some bruhaha on Mon Apr 22, 2019 2:02 pm
Isn't there some way we can blame Canada?
Only if they're a proxy (tips the hat)
Sadly, Canadians tend to suffer immediate heat stroke upon arriving in Houston. They make terrible spies in Texas.
Because to review projects you have to agree to keep them confidential. In the old days, the occasional scandals came when a proposals from a reviewed grant mysteriously turned up in the next grant from the reviewer. In one case I know of, that was then sent out to the original proposer to review, and he had an acute attack of deja vu, and shortly thereafter the shit hit the fan.
So was Qian supposedly in 1950. He spent the next 5 years in effective house arrest before being cleared, by which time he understandably had soured on working on ANYTHING for the US gov and returned to China. Maybe these scientists were rotten - maybe not. I don't know, and neither does anyone in here (and if they did they couldn't talk about it). But the current atmosphere, in general, does look like paranoia towards China so it's not an unreasonable suggestion.
Luckily we have beer
Bah! Those ""scientists"" are telling us that naturally occurring minerals are BAD for you? They just want everything sterilized and dead so they can drain your wellness and keep you locked up in hospitals, pumping you full of poisonous chemicals, like mercury, for the rest of your life! </S>
You have to cook that raw water before consumption.
Sure there are. But after you pass the stuff through an ion-exchange resin, can it still be sold as ""Natural""? I mean, there should be standards for this...
If you eat a lot of rice, consider cooking your rice in a coffee-maker; that way much of the arsenic is carried away instead of being re-absorbed. I've been doing this for years (I eat a lot of rice and beans) and two fillings of the tank in my little Mr. Coffee are sufficient to cook one basket of rice.
I am not sure what all the complaints are about, lead and arsenic are perfectly natural. Cholera is also perfectly natural. You did want water in its natural state, right?
Wow that's an interesting technique! I've been vigorously rinsing my rice for a while, and trying to soak it when I remember ahead of time in order to reduce arsenic. We've got a nice rice cooker that makes very nice rice. It's on the low end of the fancy Rice cooker spectrum but it really does make better rice than more basic stuff. I'm curious what the coffee maker rice is like. Considering that rice cookers can go up to something like 700$ I wonder how long before arsenic-removing ones become available. The expensive machines are marketed towards families that eat rice very often so I think there would be a good market for them.
Distilled, but with minerals added back in? Drinking distilled water alone regularly isn't great for you, since it increases the rate that you secrete electrolytes and some trace minerals. Plus, distilled water usually contains other stuff, potentially including the container it comes in. Water is the universal solvent, after all.
I'm sure consumer laws in the land off the free will protect the public. Or let them drink coke.
Willfully selling products that are exceptionally close to the allowed FDA limits, and making moral statements such as this one is bound to land you in trouble. In fact I hope it does.
I disagree! Trace arsenic in this homeopathic water grants me arsenic resistance and cures any status effects caused by it. /s
How does this compare to tap?
What is this, Arsenic Technica?
This reminds me the romans and the lead water pipes. There are historical reasons to believe that lead poisoning was a factor on the collapse of the Roman Empire. Don’t know if it was so relevant, but surely didn’t help. Specially if it affects your brain.... US is poisoning itself with its water & food. Deja vu?
You're right. I only consume organic arsenic because who wants all that synthetic stuff in their water?
Tap water here (europe) is constantly monitored for all kinds of contamination so it is a far better, a lot cheaper and far more environment friendly options than bottled water. Unfortunately the PR has managed to convince people that bottled water is somehow better (it is for the corporate profits but that's about it).
Not for the same reasons. Romans didn't know any better, the science had not advanced to that level yet. In modern days the science is overwhelming to the point that it is dismissed as only beliefs and opinions. The aforementioned homeopathic aspect is on point here.
I just admit, bottled water just tastes better. To me, at least. It's just that I'm used to it, maybe? But tap water tastes... like... disappointment. I know tap is better, but well... I just want to feel good when I drink water. Maybe I need help.
Well! Maybe Gen Jack Ripper was on to something after all!
Personne wrote: Not for the same reasons. Romans didn't know any better, the science had not advanced to that level yet. Actually there's evidence that they knew lead contamination was harmful, if not the specific mechanisms. Roman writers often complained about adulterated wine, with merchants including lead salts to sweeten it (although they still recommended lead cauldrons for preparing grape must because copper alloy pots produced a bitter precipitate in the product, they also recommended coating the cauldron with oils first). Wealthy Romans preferred clay plumbing to lead pipes. http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/enc ... oning.html Quote: ""Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that through lead; indeed that conveyed in lead must be injurious, because from it white lead [PbCO3, lead carbonate] is obtained, and this is said to be injurious to the human system. Hence, if what is generated from it is pernicious, there can be no doubt that itself cannot be a wholesome body. This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour; for in casting lead, the fumes from it fixing on the different members, and daily burning them, destroy the vigour of the blood; water should therefore on no account be conducted in leaden pipes if we are desirous that it should be wholesome. That the flavour of that conveyed in earthen pipes is better, is shewn at our daily meals, for all those whose tables are furnished with silver vessels, nevertheless use those made of earth, from the purity of the flavour being preserved in them"" (VIII.6.10-11).
There are differences between countries/regions though. When I was living in Bavaria, the tap water was technically potable - but it contained so much chalk that I found it completely intolerable without a Brita filter (and having some aftertaste even with it). Here in Finland, I only buy bottled water if it's hot and I've forgot to bring a water bottle with me. But in either location, or for most(/all?) of Europe, tap water will likely be better than bottled water when it comes to bacteria/contaminants.
In California, at least, water companies are required to mail semi-annual reports summarizing independent laboratory test results to every billing address on a semi-annual basis. Everyone can see the results. Compare with Neatle's attitude, above, of ""Trust us"", but we aren't required to release our testing, but you can ""treat us"", Add to that the waste impact of all those single-use plastic containers. I'll stick with tap water. Cheers!
It's very dependent on where that tap water is sourced. Growing up in eastern Denmark, I'm used to very high levels of calcium. Swedish tap water tastes really weird to me with less calcium and much more iron.

Citation requested. I was curious enough to look around and most of the places screaming about the dangers of distilled water (in terms of ""IT WILL KILL YOU"") seem to be the ""alternative medicine"" types. Otherwise, the most common downsides I've read regarding drinking distilled water is: 1) It doesn't taste very good (flat), and 2) You eliminate a potential source of useful minerals (namely calcium and magnesium) compared to, say, natural well water; however, is not a problem if you eat a healthy diet and get your minerals from food. If you know of scientifically rigorous studies that show additional health concerns from drinking distilled water, I'd like to read them and learn more.
Quote: Whole Foods, on the other hand, said that it had run its own tests on batches of water that CR tested and determined that the levels were acceptable. The company’s test results “show these products are fully compliant with FDA standards for heavy metals,” Whole Foods told CR in a statement. It added that it tests ""every production run of water before it is sold” and that the company would “never sell products that do not meet FDA requirements.” Quote: Testing of Whole Foods’ Starkey Water revealed levels at or just a smidge below federal limits, with results ranging from 9.48 ppb to 10.1 ppb. There's no contradiction between those two statements, but what it says is Whole Foods has consistently been producing a product with as much arsenic as they are permitted to include. That really shows the need for tough enforcement standards and conservative limits, since the companies will literally do the least they can possibly do, to produce a product that is not any safer than required by law. Does not inspire much trust in their practices in other areas where the regulations are even weaker.
Never had much trust for bottled water myself (not that all of it is unhealthy) but between so much wasteful plastic being used and my suspicion that plastic with water and the apparent degradation that comes with its transportation, (think piles of bottles exposed to heat and cold etc) I've grown to trust tap and some type of britta filtration much better.
it's not new though, the generation that lived in peak airborn lead times, is the primary voting block right now.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223198/ It has no real short term ill effects other than that many do not like the taste. It can be a concern if you mineral deficient, and the magnesium can be a real health problem if you are not getting enough. Additionally, cooking with it may remove much of this from the food you are eating depending upon method, so you need to be sure you still have adequate magnesium intake over time. Normal tap water does not always contain this either, it is a random grab bag of what your area had, minus anything dangerous. It does introduce a possible hazard in some cases which would not be present without distillation, but tap water does not contain anything irreplaceable. The electrolyte content is generally small in water anyway, if you need to replace it in normal use a pinch of salt in a meal will do. If you are an athlete spending your day working out it is not close to enough either way. This is why they make drinks like Gatorade, which are more similar to what you need to replace.
I'm used to the high chalk content so I don't mind it. Water in northern Sweden (well, above Skåne that is) tastes better due to it being a lot softer but either is fine with me. Convenience of tap is hard to beat as is the price and lack of plastic contaminants in the water itself. In any case it is very difficult to combine care for the environment and drinking of bottled water (fine if on a trip or something but at home or work it is absurdly high environmental impact and often less well controlled than tap water).
Thanks for the link; it was a good read. It sounds like there's nothing wrong or dangerous about distilled water when used for just drinking (e.g. it's not going to leach calcium right out from your bones/teeth, as some alarmist articles state), but rather to be mindful of how it interacts with food when used in cooking (i.e. could reduce nutritional value). That is good to know!
I've always undertood that arsenic was an essential element. Something to do with methionine. Of course it's all a matter of dose. A quick search turned this up, but there are other articles.

I have traveled to a few places in the US which had sulfur problems. It is not really a health issue in terms of being dangerous, so it is not really regulated much, but I find it quite bad for drinkability due to the taste and smell. Even where I am in a city, they are tearing up the road doing utility improvements near my home. The water is occasionally full of air, and has noticeable sediment. I have a Brita filter, but that is not really a great way to be sure there is nothing unwanted in the water (especially when you have no idea what you are trying to remove). At some point it starts making sense to distill it for a while, which is successful at removing a wide range of substances (and I do own a water distiller, so that is relatively easy). Sure Dasani may be better than distilled water, but distilled water can easily be better than tap water overall.
I wonder how good tap water is for drinking. I always hear about how it's less dangerous than most bottled water and it's tested regularly. However, that testing seems to be way before it comes out of your faucet. What's done to ensure that the pipes the water run through aren't causing problems? I recall seeing some places where the water is brown but turns clear after running the faucet for awhile. Not exactly reassuring given the problems that may exist aren't usually visible... How would one test the potability of your tap water. Does it require expensive equipment/service? Put another way, does the water stay as clean as it was upstream (water company) when I drink it downstream (my faucet) or did someone pee in the river in between?
The only problem with fines as a remedy is the facility it provides the wealthy to ignore what others cannot.
Good.

Excellent. Dare I hope that the fines are used to pay for vaccinations for the needy?
Can the fines go straight to local health clinics to support vaccination efforts for those with less fortunes?
Thoughtful wrote: The only problem with fines as a remedy is the facility it provides the wealthy to ignore what others cannot. Hopefully the fines escalate, without a cap, with continued non-compliance. Edit: From what I can find, noncompliance could be fined up to a maximum of $2,000 per day of noncompliance. Section 3.05 of the NYC health code requires compliance with orders from the health department: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloa ... ticle3.pdf Quote: No person shall violate an order of the Board, Commissioner or Department.

Each such violation may be treated as a separate and distinct offense, and in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance thereof may be treated as a separate and distinct offense. (b) Any person who is determined to have conducted, carried on, or in any way engaged in an activity without a permit, license, registration, or other authorization required by this Code shall be subject to a fine, penalty and forfeiture of not less than one thousand and not more than two thousand dollars. (c) Where a person fails to appear in a proceeding brought pursuant to Article 7 of this Code, the penalties imposed for each sustained violation shall be double the amount that would otherwise be assessed by the hearing examiner, but shall not exceed the maximum penalty specified in subdivision (a) or (b) of this Section, or in the other applicable law or regulation.

Unfortunately even poor anti-vaxers won't have trouble using the internet to get other cultists to pay their fines if they can't. Unless continued defiance results in child welfare taking the kids from their parents and vaccinating them or locking the parents up it's not actually going to do anything other than supplying schadenfreude for the rest of us.
It's been a serious problem for a while now. Should have been done sooner. There's already one adult in a coma because of the outbreak and rates are up over 300% from last year. Last edited by THavoc on Fri Apr 19, 2019 9:01 am
Fines should only be the first step if these people don't vaccinate themselves or their kids. What's next, ""Get to know your friendly neighbourhood Ebola virus""? The state has powers primarily and especially for things like protecting public health, it's literally one of the most important things a state is for. People who recklessly endanger others through something utterly stupid like refusing to vaccinate should have the book thrown at them.
Yep. We live in a society, fucking act like it.
Next steps: get vaccinated or get out.
500 measles cases in the US? That’s nothing. There were 50,000 in Ukraine last year, and 10,000 cases a month this year. Vaccines are available, free, and mandatory, but parents forge vaccination certificates to avoid them. Even with a raging epidemic, parents refuse to vaccinate their kids. Why? Facebook. The globalizer of idiocy.
The outcome is unsurprising. How does one claim religious exemption when over 95% of the same religious community vaccinates?
The state's respond while better than nothing is somewhat dubious. CA just bans non-medical exemptions and calls it a day. Allowing religious exemptions (which endanger public health) to only then restrict them AFTER a measles outbreak happens just leads to unnecessary suffering. No religious (or personal) exemptions. Period. On edit: oop. I meant non-medical not medical. Yeah banning medical exemptions would be cruel and stupid. Last edited by Statistical on Fri Apr 19, 2019 9:39 am
Great Idea - let's take it further. It should be a percentage of their total value.
""95% of my nominal co-coreligionists don't correctly understand God's will"" /antivaxcultist
What? AFAIK CA bans religious exemptions, not medical. Medical ones can be completely legit - immune compromised, etc.
Personally, Anti-Vaxxers are some of the most selfish people. They don't seem to care about the potential victims of their stupidity like this Israeli flight attendant: https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/17/heal ... index.html And this 8 month old baby: https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/18/heal ... index.html
No medical exemptions gets people dead. Methinks you mean non-medical exemptions. And the outcome has been an increase in medical exemptions roughly equal to the number of religious exemptions.
I am very weary of being told that I have to have empathy for bigots and idiots and carefully approach them so their little feelings aren't hurt. They are idiots and bigots. And yes, that is a problem for all of us. But the solution isn't to tiptoe around the plain facts of idiocy and bigotry. Don't let the antivaxers kids into schools. Call the racists out for the racism. Stop covering for them.
I'm assuming a typo/thinko and that Statistical intended to write ""non-medical"".
This makes me so happy. As I said in a previous thread, fuck these people. I depend on herd immunity for my survival, and this is a good - if overdue - first step towards not letting morons kill me. Last edited by palsyboy on Fri Apr 19, 2019 9:13 am
There _are_ rare but valid medical reasons where getting vaccinated is life threatening. Exclude all the bogus pseudo medical exceptions and have all medical exceptions examined by a state medical board with loss of the right to practice for those doctors found to be abusing (as they are doing in CA if IIRC), but don't outlaw medical exceptions.
'per family child per day' would have been ideal.
No, they should be confronted even more aggressively. If fines don't work, take away their kids. It's child abuse. Straight up.
So I'm confused: were the 3 people fined by the city 3 of the 5 mothers who brought the lawsuit, or just 3 different, random people that had nothing to do with it? The headline and article make it seem like it's 3 of the 5 anti-vax moms. Last edited by Hezio on Fri Apr 19, 2019 9:15 am
Michigan measles outbreak linked to outbreak in New York https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/health/m ... index.html
Obviously the non-antagonistic way failed. That's why we have an outbreak.
Here's part of the problem:   https://issuu.com/peachmoms/docs/the_va ... andbook_a4
The point of it is that it's coercive. If it's just a suggestion, then it's useless.
You’re right, we should ask them nicely. That will definitely get them to do it. You’re right, we should show them that their beliefs are wrong. That will definitely get them to do it. You’re right, we should explain to them the danger of not vaccinating. That will definitely get them to do it.
Those fines should be a significant percentage of the family’s income... Putting themselves at risk as well as others should be treated as a serious public health issue. They should feel the pain of their stupidity.
I think one could read the law to consider each child to be a separate violation, so 2 unvaccinated kids would be 2 separate violations, and could lead to 2 violations per day for non-compliance. Keep in mind that $2,000 a day is $730,000 a year (365 days), so it adds up.
Oh how I love good news regarding anti-vax nitwits being put in their place. It's beyond dangerous, irresponsible, and stupid to not vaccinate your children unless they have a legitimate medical issue. New York City is the most densely populated city in the US by far, with Brooklyn averaging 36,732 people per square mile. I'm honestly to the point where if these people still refuse to vaccinate their children, Child and Protective Services should take them and put them in foster care. Their parents are being willfully belligerent to the public health, wellbeing, and good by not vaccinating their children. If the parents fight, arrest them and make their day even worse. People like this make my blood boil, so no mercy from me.

From the BBC article on measles uptick in Africa; ""measles is far from harmless. It kills around 100,000 people, mostly children, every year."" If you are an antivaxxer you are partially responsible.

Everyone who joins this lawsuit should be fined $1,000 and their children should be given the MMR vaccine.

Seems like something akin to SLAPP is appropriate. If you drag a public official (or other expert) into court in flagrant negligence of what is established to be the scientific consensus, you can pay their reasonable fees for their appearance, perhaps quadrupled or so.

Pass a law forbidding insurance companies to cover expenses due to illness that could have been prevented by vaccination in the absence of a (valid) medical exception.

If I got the measles, or worse, had an immunocompromised kid who got the measles, I would sue those clueless motherfuckers for every nickel they have. Vaccines should be compulsory, and refusing them on ""religious grounds"" should be prima facie evidence of unsuitability to have custody of children.
I hate how fascists want to force innocent people to unwillingly take harmful, medically unnecessary substances into their bodies against their will, and turn to the government to force their fanatical anti-rights pro-harm beliefs on others.

Can those who have been impacted by the infections counter-sue the anti-vaxers for their reckless endangerment?
It clearly affects civil liberties to force people to undergo medical treatment. Most civilized places have decided that in the case of vaccines the harm of affecting others’ right to life outweighs your own rights — by a mile.
Terrible parents peddle misinformation and misuse legal system to demand imaginary right to spread preventable disease. This is peak 2019.
Back in the day refusal to live by community standards was punishable by banishment from the clan (which was generally a death sentence for the offending party). It continued unabated through the 19th century (that's what Australia was , a place to banish people that failed to meet community standards). It is unfortunate that we no longer have frontiers to banish these people to. Maybe set them adrift in the middle of the pacific?

It's part of a social contract when you live in a society. Don't do things that threaten the group. Be responsible. If you don't like it, please extract yourself from society so we don't have to run into you.
Thanks for re-iterating my statement more clearly....
I have noticed some of the moms of my daughter's friends trying to sort of bait us into this mom one upping and casting judgement that we aren't feeding her organic food or making her listen to classical music or home birthed her into a tub, etc. At least among this group, anti-vax is a part of this one upping and there is an air of judgement. Without the freedom to deny vaccines to their kids, how else will they rub it in the faces of the other moms that they are the alpha parent?! I don't think this aspect is the sole reason, but I definitely think it contributes.
It is the children who are disproportionately affected, which is a situation I consider intolerable. (Paraphrasing) ""we say it is de jure not okay to punish a child for the parent's misdeeds"" was perhaps the best, most forward-thinking part of the US Constitution, and we have more than a few decent passages to choose from.
It will be interesting to see how this plays out. Public health is one of those places where there are often some pretty serious laws still on the books, not used all that often because ghastly pandemics aren't what they used to be; but still in place; so they might have an uphill fight in arguing that the state can't do something as comparatively noninvasive as vaccination mandates in response to an emerging medical problem. (compared to, say, mandatory quarantine, which isn't necessarily off the table legally speaking) By way of background, the NYC's board of health traces its history to 1793; when epidemic yellow fever broke out in Philadelphia and everyone got (justifiably) jumpy about repeated outbreaks of a nasty and then untreatable disease (despite their efforts, including quarantines, yellow fever made it into the city, and reached epidemic proportions several times). It was then reactivated when cholera broke out in quantity starting in the early 1830s and happening repeatedly. Perhaps a contemporary judiciary will take an, um, jaundiced, view of some of the rules because of a greater feeling of safety; but the view of what constitutes a legitimate public health response, historically, was shaped by some pretty grim circumstances, bodies piling up as the doctors could do nothing type stuff, so less likely to be overly concerned about what facebook told you the vaccines might do.
Whenever I hear the phrase “mostly children” I automatically hear Bender’s voice and him bragging about how many humans he stuffed into a suicide booth.
Can these idiots be held responsible when their poor children infect and kill someone else's child?

Sounds like we need a good, old-fashioned quarantine. Let's see how mad they are when they're confined to their homes until their children are vaccinated.
- Charles Dickens

I think pro-players are fully responsible would be more accurate. If everyone was vaccinated then the current strains of measles would in all likelihood cease to exist outside of a lab. Second every pro-plaguer, let’s call them what they are, are a potential vessel for a measles mutation to a new strain that isn’t covered by vaccines.
If the bodies pile up, it will be because our modern medical system gets overwhelmed. Before that happens, these people will end up in camps, and rightly so.
Do you think the Danes would be receptive to us buying Disko Island off the western cost of Greenalnd from them and shipping all these people there? ""Don't want to vaccinate your children because of your particular interpretation of religious texts that mention neither hide nor hare of vaccines, eh? OK then, off to Plague Island with you!""
People too often forget - their privileges come at the cost of responsibilities. All the great stuff that comes from living in a society requires that people don't actively try to harm that society. That's why we have laws, that's why we have social mores, and that's why it's critical to vaccinate kids if at all medically possible.

I don't believe so. The primary purpose of Stennis is a test stand facility. It has test stands out the wazoo. Small test stands, large test stands, vacuum chamber test stands, multi-engine test stands. If there is a way to make a stand that tests things there is likely a version at Stennis. The production facilities were formerly used by the DoD and granted to NASA more than a decade? ago but NASA has never found a use for it.
To not require loads of employees that cost money (hence low cost rockets). Just another nail in the coffin of good paying jobs. Edit: added complete vision
These states that are enacting authoritarian legislation might want to think about that... people already don't want to come to Mississippi because of it... there's a serious brain drain going on and has been for some time. This is felt strongly in the medical field. Natives to the state get educated and get out. Trying to attract outsiders is difficult... those that are willing to come want a lot of money (from a poor state) to make it worthwhile and then they eventually leave after a few years anyway. The failing medical situation makes it less attractive to outsiders as well. Disclaimer: I grew up in Mississippi. I got educated and got out. I still have lots of family and friends there (and I go back to visit). Granted, I landed in a place not far off from Mississippi but where I live now is practically an island of rationality in a sea of Red.
I still don't get how 3D printing a large aluminum can is supposed to be cheaper for the same performance than rolling and welding it.
I really need a banana or something for scale in that image. Everything in that image could be huge, small or somewhere in between. This could be a building for ants.
Labor for adding stringers? Defect rates? I am not sure myself either just throwing ideas out there. Relativity seems to believe it can be done.
Tech Week has some info on what the company sees as advantages to 3D printing. https://techweek.com/relativity-space-i ... re-rocket/
Being the N-teenth small sat launcher but the one with expensive 3D printed tankage and structures.
No, the boosters would be cleaned at KSC (to prevent corrosion) and then shipped back to Utah for refurbishment at Thiokol's plant, which was the only place they could be filled with propellant. Edit: pages 40-45 of this PDF describe the refurb process flow.
Relativity Space has spoken in the past about 3D printing a rocket on Mars. Like, rather than having a rocket that can go to Mars and fly back, they'd ship the 3D printer to Mars, and then build a brand-new rocket from scratch on the Red Planet. Seems pretty impractical, but that's what they're going with. My personal belief is that their actual vision is ""demonstrate advanced 3D printing/automated manufacturing techniques for aerospace applications, then get acquired by someone who needs that."" Unlike most of the other smallsat launcher companies, their technology (if it works) has general applicability to many areas of engineering, so they can easily pivot to something else if launchers don't work out for them.

Edit: pages 40-45 of this PDF describe the refurb process flow. Yeah, I forgot who did what, I just remember the Mississippi facility being involved with the Shuttle program, and what they did was engine testing and flight certification for giant rocket engines on giant test stands: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._S ... ace_Center Quote: The initial requirements for NASA's proposed rocket testing facility required the site to be located between the rockets' manufacturing facility at Michoud Assembly Facility in eastern New Orleans, Louisiana, and the launch facility at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Also, the site required barge access as the rocket motors to be tested for Apollo were too large for overland transport. Additionally, the Apollo motors were too loud to be tested at Marshall Space Flight Center's existing test stands near Huntsville, Alabama. A more isolated site was needed. As for the shuttle SRB motors refurbishing, it was a team effort with some work being done at KSC where they were towed to by the recovery ship, and the main segments shipped by flatbed rail car back to the manufacturer, Thiokol in Utah, where they were repacked with solid propellant. Here's is another excruciatingly detailed documentation of the procedure: http://www.nasa-klass.com/Curriculum/Ge ... essing.pdf
There's no possible advantage for the tanks alone. For the engine, there may well be. Rocket engines are complicated beasts, so machining them is a pain. Then you have to assemble them, and every joint is a weak spot. Integrating it all could be an advantage. And then since you're already doing that, integrating even MORE of it might be cheaper than having multiple processes that you then have to hand-assemble. Previous news about RS indicates that they're trying to minimize their part count in the final assembly process. Will it work? Hell if I know. They make impressive 3d printers though.
Is that pronounced ""noon,"" or is he a modern-day Captain Nemo?
Just like I don't get how robots are supposed to be cheaper for a ""Relatively"" low volume product. If they were making something other than entire rockets this might somehow all make sense. Other than as a seemingly likely ""we're going to use what everyone says is Tomorrow's technology Today to siphon your money into our vision of full bank accounts!"" scheme. (or the ""demonstrate tech and competency to get acquired"" vision that trimeta offered a bit above) 3D printing only really makes potential business sense in two ways: (1) Rapid prototyping where changes need to keep being made and then physically tested in some way, where the ability to rapidly iterate a variety of changes that might require complete retooling in another process is worth more than the machine and material costs of an SLS system (because there's no way we're talking plastic here). (2) Repeatedly SLS (selective laser sintering, not the senate laugh system) printing complex metal parts that would actually cost more and take longer to make via machining (subtractive) and/or would require multiple machined parts that might introduce more points of failure via assembly than if a single solid piece. And that assumes the SLS process can be achieved in optimal materials and will result in parts with the right tolerances (including surface smoothness), and that the laser sintering process itself won't affect the resulting temper on the part in a way that's problematic. Both of these would probably only apply to assembly pieces/engine parts. Assumedly the robotic manufacturing part would apply to things like tanks/etc. But if you have the volume for robots to make sense for everything else, it seems like generally CNC machining via robots would probably often (not always) make more sense for whatever parts you would otherwise be SLS printing. Maybe not. But this all just seems a little suspect when you throw together both robots AND 3d printing as some magic solution. Setting up and tuning a highly or fully robotic factory is a huge overhead in and of itself. I do know that SLS printing for engine parts has been explored, there was actually an article here awhile back about it, and I think there have been some more recent ones too.

They have a engine that seems to work well. And a launch site, test facilities, and now more manufacturing facilities. So they are well ahead of most of the other small launch startups.
I can really see the states fighting it out with competitive tax incentives over this job creator... oh wait.
3D printing engines makes sense. Those have complex geometry that is difficult to manufacture any other way. But tanks are mostly simple, thin structures under a lot of tension. That's generally the worst application for printing.
Considering there are more than 100 announced worldwide that really isn't a high bar. I expect the rocket side will not materialize and relativity goes into engineering consulting for setting up 3D manufacturing facilities and maybe even customizing printers.
That's really light on technical details and boils down to ""rapid design iteration"". Which makes sense for a lot of things but not tank acreage.
One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords. I'd like to remind them - I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves.

Good news, everyone. We're bringing manufacturing back to Mississippi. Bad news, there won't be any actual manufacturing jobs. But y'all already knew that. It's the same old thing. Out of state company swoops in, buys land (and legislators), builds factory, staffs it with people from out of state, who live in the next city over because your town is a redneck infested banjo-ville. There is no net tax revenue, so the roads get more crowded, pot-holed, and there's no money to fix any of it. You can't get a job at the factory because your local schools suck because a tax cut is much better than hiring teachers and paying them a living wage. Even though ""living wage"" is an alarmingly low sum in these parts. So your best bet is fixing the plumbing or air conditioning or cleaning house or ""would you like fries with that"" over in the exploding suburbs in the neighboring city. At least medicaid got expanded, cause none of these jobs have health insurance. Oh, well, maybe not. Well, at least we can 3D print tanks and dream of space.
Why 3D print? Some of the parts in large machinery are complex and expensive. Some engine components could require two or three separate machined parts joined together. GE reduced complexity in a turbo prop through printing: ""The result of more than a decade of research and development, GE will produce parts of the engine through several processes pioneered by company, including direct metal laser melting. These techniques produce an engine with approximately 30 percent fewer parts than a conventional turboprop while reducing the number of steps and inspections involved in the engine’s manufacture. The design also eliminates the risk of losses and leakages from joints — by eliminating the joints entirely."" source: https://www.ge.com/reports/treat-avgeek ... ft-engine/ There a lot of areas where 3D printing (broadly speaking) could reduce costs and time while improving quality and safety.
The question isn't ""why 3D print?"", it's ""why 3D print the entire rocket?"" Other companies are already working on 3D printing engine components or even entire engines, but Relativity was born out of the question ""what happens if we apply 3D printing technology to everything?"" What's unclear to outside observers is whether that actually makes sense.
That depends on just how much machining you're actually doing. Consider ""traditional"" rocket bodies where you start with a thick sheet of material, machine it on one side down to a thin shell with a complex geometric pattern, and then roll it into a cylinder. That's exceedingly time consuming, far more so than just printing that structure from the ground up. What doesn't make sense is why you would print the whole structure from the ground up, as opposed to taking a thin sheet, rolling it into a cylinder, and then printing your geometric pattern on the inside. The only reason is you're trying to build something with the minimum of machine hardware possible, which is what you would want to do if you were building somewhere with no industrial base (i.e. Mars).
3D printing will be incredibly useful for long-duration spaceflight and off-world settlement. There will be all manner of spare parts and other things which we'll want to be able to print. The thing is, if we have people living on Mars (for example), rockets are the last thing they'd want to be able to print. The Mars inhabitants will demand many times more mass delivered from Earth than they'll want to return to Earth, and therefore the area surrounding the settlement will become a sprawling garden of rockets which have landed on Mars and have no near-term reason to be refueled and sent back to Earth. Rockets will be the one thing (perhaps excluding dust) which the settlement will possess in great excess of demand. They won't be interested in printing rockets. They'll be interested in printing parking facilities for the rockets they have laying around.
Right, but also rapid production. So you maximize rockets / employee. Also, if they successfully automate, there is an easy scale up requiring no or few extra employees. They are still missing the reuse factor though.
From a manufacturing standpoint nothing beats a traditional process. However the up front capital expense for dies and forms etc. is high and not flexible. But you get massive scale manufacturing at really cheap per unit costs. Prototyping tools like they use are great for ... prototyping and rapid iteration. So I think that is their main angle. A software fix for any hardware screw up. But the mechanical properties of 3D printing is different too, so as long as that is not an impediment you lose nothing. There is some angle maybe with less mass by exactly 3D printing only what is needed. So maybe for low volume stuff like rockets its an ok direction to go? If they succeed everyone gets to copy them. If it's a boondoggle they become the nth smallspace outfit to fold after exhausting their capital. As outsiders I think it's hard for us to properly evaluate their approach. If the 3D printing lets them rapidly iterate to reuse that would be quite an advantage. Well never mind, this is all in the article BeowulfSchaeffer linked above. Interesting that they seem to already be very cost competitive with room for a lot of improvement. Last edited by Azethoth666 on Tue Jun 11, 2019 10:13 am
I'd have gone with a Librarian or Odysseus reference myself, but to each their own.
Great image! It reminds me of shipping containers stacking up at U.S. Pacific ports due to a trade imbalance with China. The thing is, rockets are more expensive than shipping containers. I would expect it still makes sense to fly the rocket back to Earth so it can be reused, even if it's mostly empty on the return trip. That assumes fuel can be manufactured on Mars and that reuse is much more economical than manufacturing cheap, disposable rockets.
Wonder how many of the jobs will go to native Missippeans, considering that on top of the brain drain fitten already mentioned, Mississippi ranks 49 out of 51 in public high school rankings, and from the same source, of 132 public colleges, a whopping two are in Mississippi, at #78 and #97. Oh, and apparently the highest poverty rate of any US state! You rabidly embrace anti-intellectualism, anti-modernity, and are just generally not a nice place live in unless you like to thump your Bible and/or hunt... well, have fun with the repurcusions.
This facility is located in Hancock County, right on The Gulf, next to the Louisiana line and up the coast from Biloxi. It got clobbered by Katrina and I imagine it's climate is best described as ""Not quite Amazonian, but close."" I'll pass. thanks.
So, other than that, it's practically a garden spot?
I love the notion of a ""gently used"" booster.
Well I have hard time seeing NASA in a VC role, I think their job should be to push the commercial sector further, and help bring together companies across several industries to get the job done. They definitely should be out of the transportation side of things though,
Reason Foundation's report surely is an interesting read! Unfortunately, when dealing with politics we are most likely not going to get what we'd like to get, meaning (specifically) that SLS pork will go on forever.
Well it isn't surprising that Proton is struggling commercially, 1/10 seem to fail, there's a lot of geopolitical concerns, and with insurance premiums it is no longer the least expensive option and even if you snagged one before they cancelled the Proton Medium, it wouldn't be significantly less expensive.
SLS won't live forever, only until it can no longer be justified to the public (when SS is flying), there will still be pork to be sure, but it will be around payloads, which will be more scientifically useful.
That notion is also why early on almost all reflights were CRS and later Iridium
I imagine it's not that thrashed boosters are thrashed, more that the numbers just aren't there yet. They've probably got a nice reliability spreadsheet that has lots of first and second flights, but few third+ flights, and their stats for these low-number flights error-bar out.
Plus there's the re-entry, a booster that put something in higher orbit will have gotten hotter.
The only real advantage of that sea launch platform is where the stages drop
When you're flying hydrazine first stages, and SOP is to drop them on populated areas, that's a considerable advantage.
Doesn't a sea-launch platform offer other advantages, like moving the launch site away from populated areas, not needing to use commercial or military airports, the ability to move the platform to a location optimized for the payload, etc? Genuinely asking, I don't know much about the barge based platforms other than rough seas tipped one and SpaceX lost a Falcon 9 booster due to chop.
Woot! I'm famous. The ammunition plant is about 30 miles from Madison https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badger_Ar ... tion_Plant Brian
was wondering when someone was going to try in-orbit servicing, nice to see something is going to launch capture demo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJZ3xmuom0M its like a permanently attached tugboat
They already act like that though. Resupply and commercial crew essentially got VC funding of a kind. I think it would be weird not to continue down that path, even to the point of having an investment pool.
The Chinese Long March 11 launch showed clearly it is a re-purposed ICBM. The rocket is tossed up in the air by a hot gas generator before the first stage ignites. That is a technique used to launch ICBMs from underground silos lacking stand-offs and auxiliary venting
Why on earth is an American company launching on the proton anyway?
The July test is an in-flight abort test. The Orion LAS has already been tested from the ground https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c9rS5G5X6Y
I'm guessing because this is experimental/low budget they went for the cheapest ride share they could find.

It would be kind of nice if our science missions could refuel. Especially the cryogenics based ones. Maybe we could even add a scheme for attaching / detaching gyroscope packages. That seems to be the three most common things that go wrong / run low from reading the public press.
Watching the video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_cont ... wTsift1GR8, I wonder if they are planning to keep doing it that way. It sure looks like it saves a ton of wear and tear on the ship.
Only flow to LEO by a granny on sundays. ... so far as you know. I didn't actually know CSA had a major launch coming up, that's pretty awesome. The price tag is awe-inspiring, too. One billion sitting on one rocket, for an agency that gets about 250 million a year. Somebody's going to have major anxiety come launch time!
I wonder if this launch was from contested waters. The Chinese are big at doing stuff like this trying establish a claim for sovereignty.
That is what launch insurance is for. And re-insurers for the insurers.
No, it said close to a coast which rules out the islands they have in other peoples territory or exclusion zones.
Somebody is puckering with $1B on the line. Even insured the CSA likely would be extremely sad, too, as that must represent a huge project for them and no doubt a lot of planning is hinging on whether or not it goes off. You don't invest like that without caring a lot that it happens when you want it to happen. Insurance doesn't cover everything, it only takes some of the sting out of your multi-year effort swirling down the metaphorical drain. Last edited by Tyler X. Durden on Fri Jun 07, 2019 8:16 am
The $1 billion 3 satellite Canada launch will be nail biting.
Government payloads usually aren't insured.
Article said in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Shandong, China doesn't have any contested maritime claims there.
Shandong province is the other side of the Yellow sea from the Korea peninsula. Well away from the disputed areas. The launch path might be a political message, i.e. over Japan or Russia but not the launch site. Errg Ninjaed
[Ninja'ed by JonathanSmith]
That platform can't sail North or South to match the needs of the orbit inclination? (Haven't seen the photo/video yet...) [Have now read the article, seen the photo,...] ""The maritime launch platform used in this launch is owned and run by an unnamed Chinese maritime engineering. The platform is roughly 110 x 80 m in size, being equipped with a 15.5 m high TEL, and was anchored at 34.90 deg. N, 121.19 deg. E."" My eyeball judges it to be not self-propelled. Thus, no, it is not going to be crossing oceans. Last edited by jaminb on Fri Jun 07, 2019 8:34 am
Depends if it's really seaworthy or just a coastal barge. And this is a smallsat launcher, and most smallsats go to SSO or polar orbit, or at least a high inclination, for which there is little advantage to matching latitude to inclination. Some, but not nearly as much as an equatorial launch.
You are right. Although CSA insured a previous launch this one isn't. https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/satell ... -1.4895428 ""Ottawa has only once taken out insurance on a launch of Canadian space hardware — $80 million for RADARSAT-1 — and will have to eat any losses if the RCM project fails after liftoff.""
And Russia claimed to complete a hypersonic intercept, complete with eerie sound effects (although maybe those were dubbed in post...) Last edited by ryanmct on Fri Jun 07, 2019 8:37 am
How fast can it travel with the rocket onboard? That's going to affect its feasible range, on top of the question of how big of area of ocean there is that is politically feasible to launch out of. If it is moving slow they become more and more at risk for weather impact during the trip to the launch site.
Yeah. I mean what we're not pointing at is the lack of acreage on this platform to put tanks of liquid oxidizer and liquid fuel faaaaar from the launch tower. (Brief thoughts about placing such tanks underwater... still contemplating the side-effects of that idea...) A platform of this size is only going to launch solids. So, it's not super interesting long-term.
Yup. There's going to be a slew of grad students and researchers who have been pushed back years waiting for this set of satellites. A launch failure means a lot of them will never get the data, ever. They'll either be retired or moved to new projects.

""For more than eight days, the company said, the balloon maintained its position over a circular area on the ground about 120km wide. It also held station over a circle with a diameter of just 9.5km for 6.5 hours."" While impressive, is it good enough for direct observation? Guess if one could get enough cameras strapped to it and a decient transmitter it could float around that much and it wouldn't be a huge issue.
With a CEP of 120 m and a hang time measured in weeks, how is this not a DARPA project?
Anyone got links to images captured by the balloon(if its available)?
Impressive results ! Facebook will buy this tomorrow to make its own cellular network and spy on us even more.
They were untill politics (and monied interests) killed high altitude surveillance balloons .........
I am (please excuse the pun) blown away by the effectiveness and reliability of altitude-based station-keeping. Surely there must be locations and situations where there is consistent bulk motion in one direction, and the balloon cannot be kept relatively stationary. How frequent is this in space and time?
Did nobody from their company bother to proof-read their promo literature? The balloon has ""sustained lift up to 75,00 ft."" Only one number on the whole slide and they couldn't get it right.
Maybe I'm a bit slow, but how does this stay roughly in one place? The explanation is basically 'secondary balloons' but that ... umm kinda doesn't get me there? Like how does that work? Does it try and fly higher (or lower) if it winds up too far in one direction in hope of finding opposing winds at a higher altitude or something?
Correct, it adjusts altitude for favorable winds to keep it on station. That’s why “On Station” is a relatively large area the longer it stays there.
Winds are never consistently in one direction at all altitudes. The trick is changing altitude to where the winds are going where you want them to.
This technology blows me away.
Google's Project Loon also involves high altitude balloons that change their altitude to capture different direction winds so they can stay in a particular area. https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/tel ... uerto-rico
Their site is pretty light (ahem) on specifics, but I imagine that they're using super-pressure balloons here, ones which can be over-pressured so that they stay full even when they cool off at night. It's likely that they keep the top, large balloon always full, but vary the size of the smaller ones in order to control altitude. This scheme of using winds in different directions at different altitudes is also what Google's Project Loon is doing, and perhaps they're borrowing experience from them.
Cause I'm lazy, can someone explain the mechanics of how the balloon manages to go up and down ?
Over a decade ago, it was.
Inflate secondary balloons to rise, deflate them to sink. Lazy answer to a lazy question.
This is actually a reasonable question: if you're 20 km high, but move in a 60 km radius around your target location, you're going to get wildly different viewing angles. Maybe for some applications that's OK, but if you want to look straight down at a specific site, that's probably too much drift.
Cant wait to watch flatearther's attempting to counter the data and video footage.
If you want to look straight down at a specific site for many hours/days/weeks, balloons ain't for you. If your thing can handle drift, 120km area for 8 days is probably the best you could wish for edit:typo
Yes, they change altitude until they find winds in the direction they need to move in the direction they want. Upper-altitude winds are broadly mapped on a daily basis for use by commercial and military aviation. I'm not sure if those ""maps"" are accurate enough for direct use in station-keeping the balloon, or if they're a platform to help the ""guesswork."" More information on this, and how the secondary balloons function to control altitude (pump helium in and out of them? Pump in, vent out?) would've been welcome in the article.
Well, obviously they're flying it high enough to reach the illuminati's observation platform, where they swap out the video.
Here's the major application I can imagine, right off the bat: Disaster observation (flooding, fire, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.) and at the same time: temporary communications for disaster response. Continual change in viewing angle would be a plus, not a negative, for this type of observation platform.
That's exactly what Project Loon does.
... you did read the article right? You're talking about a... weather balloon - from a company making weather balloons...
""most optimum altitudes"" As opposed to less optimum altitudes?
Yup. There's a HUGE market for persistent surveillance technologies, and not a lot of decent solutions. Others to add to your list include soil moisture (drought) monitoring, wildfire and smoke monitoring, crop yields, and a whole host of others. Satellites are cool, but they're expensive and they're not persistent over a given area. Also, they live at higher altitudes so their resolution is lower, all things being equal. If they can get this to work consistently, even at the performance they've already demonstrated, they won't have any trouble landing contracts.
Maybe because they have a balloon that is, you know, up there in the air saying hey, ""this is the way the wind is blowing here, I'd like to go a different direction let's try a different altitude.""
Tethered Ballons. We had this technology 100 years ago. Just need to update with improved materials and technology.
You know the balloon has to lift the tether, right? A 25 km long tether isn't weightless.
When they want to drop altitude are they recompressing the gas or do they vent it out and eventually just run out of inflation gas.
Don't need to go so far. How would a balloon go down instead of up and float upside down, as it would have to in the supposed 'Antipodes'? Checkmate, roundists!
The answer of course is that it uses anti-air in the antipode location. Duh!
I'm not aware of any 30 mile long balloon tethers.
Oooh, oooh, oooh, i know how you can pay for the Artemis moon landing program. Cut SLS/Orion. Remove that from the 'architecture' and you will have plenty of money to do the program. You're welcome.
Does anyone else think weather observations and rover/ remote exploration will suffer? Seems like a great way to kill the “real” science NASA has been doing and hoped to do.
Constellation didn't seem quite so dead on arrival as Artemis does. How did HW Bush's Space Exploration Initiative compare? I'm not old enough to remember that one.
It had a price tag of something like $450B or something like that and was laughed out of Congress, as i recall.
My first thought was that this was a backdoor way to kill all the Earth Sciences programs that are hated by the anti-science wing of the right. I hope I'm wrong.
$500B over 20-30 years according to the 90-Day Study. It was expensive enough and vague enough that no international partners signed on.
They're frankly not that sophisticated. Trump wants the Moon because it's big and flashy. It's very highly aligned with his core fuzzy message that the past was generically more awesome. America used to go to the Moon, now it doesn't (sad!), so go to Moon again therefore #MAGA.
Shirley there must be some System Looking for Slashing program that could be cut and save the agency many billions of dollars that could be put to good use.
And Blue Origin will deliver a congratulations gift from Musk City on Mars.
Oh, I realize Trump's thinking doesn't run past the surface level, but Pence has been heavily involved in this (relative to other executive office functions), and I could see his thinking being just deep enough to reach proximate consequences.
I think that was already very politically addressed. ""the surest way to lose support in Congress is to take work away from various field centers around the country.""
Meanwhile back in DC, finding $1 trillion in tax cuts for rich people and corporations was easy-peasy. And so was finding $28 billion to bail out farmers hurt by Trump's idiotic trade war. This country has its priorities so screwed up it's not funny.
Oh, why not kill all that Climate Science stuff, after all Climate Change is just a Commie Chinese plot. [/s]
The old 1990s Space Exploration Initiative of George H.W. Bush was just a paper exercise. There was no super-expensive hardware being developed for it then as there is today with the budget-burning Space Launch System (SLS). At that time NASA was spending its human spaceflight budget on getting the Space Shuttle back into steady operation following the Jan 1986 Challenger accident. And NASA was thrashing around in an effort to come up with a final design for what turned out the be the International Space Station (ISS) after 5 years of work that resulted in one unusable design after another. That goal was not reached until 1993 when Bill Clinton decided to include the Russians in the ISS endeavor. It took 5 more years until the first part of the ISS was launched by the Russians, about 14 years after Reagan started the space station program in 1985. NASA's current return-to-the-Moon-to-stay effort has been thrashing around since the George W. Bush administration in 2005. That's 14 years ago and the first payload to be launched towards the direction of the Moon in that effort is still 4 or 5 years in the future. What the 1960s Apollo program did in 8 years will take NASA about 20 years to accomplish in this century.
And so ends the Moon 2024 plan. If you thought Republicans were going to actually put up the funding for one of the most expensive science projects in history, you haven't been paying attention for the past 30 years. See you again next election cycle, Moon Base!
I have a bad feeling about this.
The GOP has been trying to kill off public weather services so they can install a rent-seeking private monopoly for years.
It is sad to see how much the NASA budget has been cut since the 1960's (as a percentage of the overall budget). Since the cold war and space race has ended, it seems like NASA hasn't been a priority to the politicians. This is sad because NASA pushes us as a society past where we thought we could do. Whenever a company (like Google) takes a big change on a potentially life-changing product, they call it a ""Moonshot"" which brings images of how impossible people that going to the moon was, until NASA proved everyone wrong.
I've been reading Ben Bova's ""Mars"" which was written in the '80s but is still pretty good. Why can't we have an international approach to Moon and Mars exploration? The costs are way high, is there no country who would want to partner with the US on a moon and/or Mars approach. And what I mean by ""partner"" is not some token partnership where a smaller country pony's up a couple of bucks for a ride. I mean a REAL partnership that would involve joint responsibility for success and money.
NASA's funding in inflation adjusted dollars has been pretty much flat since the early 1970s. It was only higher in the mid-60s because of the massive push for Apollo.
I can't see this working well. NASA has had a lot of success with relatively low-budget programs, but not on the HSF side. SLS/Orion need a certain funding level to do anything at all even at a snail's pace, and that level is just barely being met. They certainly can't be accelerated through development while the budget belt is being tightened. Pence needs to follow though on his threat to NASA Marshall and Boeing that if SLS can't do 2024 then they will turn to commercial providers. This is Gerst trying to avoid that switch to commercial because it basically kills off his directorate. But HEOMD isn't institutionally or architecturally set up to succeed here.
I think you’re missing the point here. Republicans don’t want to kill NASA... just its Earth science mission. NASA is great for nationalism and ensuring American “dominance,” and so many NASA jobs (especially in manned space flight) are in GOP-leaning states / districts anyway. They won’t want to add to the federal budget. But if they could cut all the science-y stuff and use that money to plant more American flags around the solar system and provide proud American jobs back home in their districts, they’ll do that, it’s a win-win to them.
Quote: We’re going to do that even within my own directorate. Because everyone else in NASA is pretty damn sure your directorate will only have token cuts to it, for appearance's sake. Quote: ""It’s not that your thing isn’t a priority any more, it’s still a priority, but we’ve got to have it moved back so we can do these other objectives."" As we say here at work: ""You're on the list, you're just not at the top...""
NASA needs to follow the same path that other research agencies follow. They specify the design intent of a super computer (ORNL), Laser equipment (LLL ), use off the shelf computers (NOAA), etc and do not get involved in making most of the equipment rather the method of research used by the equipment. In my opinion, this greatly limits the ""paralysis from analysis"" that plagues most of NASA large projects over the past 50 years.
Pence: ""I have altered the mission timeline, pray I do not alter it any further.""
All this stupid wether research needs to go anyway - the climate is fine. -Pence
Republicans are not on board with The Moon mission despite their messaging. The cutting of college aid to pay for it proposal was an easy-to-spot poison pill. Any cuts NASA now makes to science projects to pay for this thing that will not happen will be obvious examples of slashing sciences to appease Republican pols and their base unless they think they can actually cut 1/3 of their budget and still get SLS running early somehow. Starve the beast ideology has left the USA on a very tight budget and there is nowhere to pull this money from without slashing war funds or increasing taxes or dipping into social programs that keep the poor and elderly alive. NASA would have to cut earth science, space science, and the SLS just to reach the $6b lowball figure that has been talked about to get the ball rolling on a project that includes the SLS. Anyone see Democratic politicians funding a NASA that doesn't do science projects? There is no way that Trump can get the votes to make this happen. I'm hoping this whole fiasco falls apart sooner rather than later, because the best that is going to happen is nothing changes. The worst is that NASA guts its important programs to pay for this propaganda.
What?
Cut Gateway and SLS.
That seems rather inconsistent.
Oh, the ""future technology"" argument. You know that technology doesn't naturally advance by itself, right?
You always say that. (Of course, you're usually correct.)
the time has come to sell the earth sciences operation to the people who care deepest about the land: exxonmobil
""It’s not that your thing isn’t a priority any more, it’s still a priority, but we’ve got to have it moved back so we can do these other objectives."" Priorities. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
Politically not acceptable in US. Partnering means that you are equals and then it is hard to proclaim that US is bestest. Plus US is unwilling to work with China while the rest don't seem to have issues with it. It is more likely that it will be CNSA, ESA, JAXA, and Roscosmos doing something without NASA.
That's absurd. NASA partners with many international agencies and companies on many projects.
21st century Spruce Goose.
Well, this was the expected outcome, but it's still sad to see. I'm glad that it got to fly at least once. I wonder if someone will figure out some other use for the airplane.

Put several sounding rockets and launch them in sequence? Get a simultaneous, good look at a region of atmosphere?
Hell, donate it and a sizeable sum to the Smithsonian and maybe they'd be able to build a hangar for it next to the place they've got out at Dulles.
At least stratolaunch got the one flight, and a hell of a lot better one than the spruce goose managed, never having made it out of ground effect. It was a damn cool plane though, I saw it in Long Beach once. There’s just something about weird planes that I find really compelling.
That's a shame, it looks so cool. I hope another company will purchase it and put it to use. Though I suppose the actual plane is only a fraction of the operating costs and something ""off the shelf"" like Virgin Orbit's 747 will be significantly cheaper. By the way I see it has 2 cockpits, would it have 2 pilots too? It'd be hard to not get them fighting over control. But also quite hard to pilot this on your own so far off center I bet.

This headline bothers me, should the word “That” be there? Shouldn’t it just be “The world’s largest airplane”...?
Was hoping he put in his will a requirement to fund the project for a couple of years or through some milestone (like launching a satellite into orbit). Guess not.
It will be used to airlift the Jaegers to the Rift when the kaiju attack.
Virgin Galactic might be able to build a much larger “SpaceShipThree” around that much lift...
It’s odd that Allen protected this project in his life but didn’t have the foresight to include it in his will. Reminds me of Disney letting his bro turn EPCOT into a run of the mill theme park.
Only one of the “cockpits” is an actual manned cockpit. The other one contains avionics but that’s it.
Well, this plain sucks.
""That the world’s largest airplane may be grounded after a single flight"" ....Am I missing something with this title? That's not grammatically correct is it?
Could it have any utility as a high-altitude research platform? Or would its operating costs be too high?
It will probably end up at Paul Allen's flight collection/museum outside of Everett.
The Aluminum Albatross?
That's a shame. I pictured both sets of pilots giving each other a thumbs up while in flight.
Yes, a very interesting project. It probably has no useful application, but still very cool.
Be nice if NASA acquired it,not for launches or anything though,can you imagine the resolution of the images you could get of the ground after strapping a few dozen lidar units and cameras to this thing?

It's mostly composites.
I'm wondering if he didn't do just that, along the lines of: ""You want my money, you get my plane off the ground first."" Perhaps he felt that that was the best he could hope for.
He didn't have any children. His only immediate family is his sister, who was named executor of his entire estate (including control over Stratolaunch).
It's a sentence fragment, like the dream fragment of the topic.
Composite Roc....
Composite Condor?
The Carbon Condor?
They nicked named it the Roc after the mythical giant bird
No need to pine or spruce at its majestic glory. This is just one of the many dead end experiments in cheap rocketry of the early 21st century. It is similar to the idea of funding your rocket program using space tourism. Turns out the space program can simply fund itself and do that a decade quicker even if you start two years later.
It's just a huge, special purpose plane. It's not good for passengers, not good for general purpose cargo. Normal airports couldn't handle it. With six engines, it probably sucks fuel. If you want to see what is cost efficient in various situations, just look at what the airlines are buying 'off the shelf' from Boeing and Airbus.
Sadly, I was thinking ""Spruce Goose"" when I first heard of this aircraft several years ago. When Paul Allen died, it kind of clenched it.
To be fair Russia helped SpaceX by the whole annexing Crimia thing.
The pivot would be to competing with SpaceX, Blue Origin, etc. except starting years behind them. At this point it would make more sense to give the money to the Gates Foundation or invest it in one of the existing launch companies instead.

Really cool to see some smaller and new companies get in on this with some pretty good sized landers to boot. Wish them all success!
Seems like the kind of low cost, high payoff missions NASA should have been funding well before now. Still: Excited to see what 2020 and 2021 bring on the lunar surface.
I would love to see SpaceX convert a roadster into a rover and drop it on the moon with full 360 degree cameras live streaming as it idly putters around on auto pilot.
I thought the biggest factor determing how close the landing pad could be to the habitation modules is 'how bad would it be if a lander exploded?'
Go NASA! Remote control rover on the Moon!
Forget idly puttering, I want to see that thing jumping craters.
Well, since Orbit Beyond says their landing precision is 1000 meters, I'd say you wouldn't want to land within a kilometer of anyone or anything.
Gosh I hope I can watch a moon landing in 2020, even if it is just an unmanned delivery. Still, '20 is only months away. Does this timeline strike anyone else as optimistic?
And these will all be ready by that 2020/2021 time frame? We barely have a rocket that can toss things into a lunar orbit. SpaceIL's Berasheet mission took months to get there and it was a tiny craft compared to these things.
There is that, but 100% of landings will kick up dust (at least until there's a prepared surface). One hopes that the number that explode is several orders of magnitude below that.
That's on open terrain, with no local terminal guidance. Once you have something else there that has a local beacon, presumably they can add whatever they need to improve the accuracy.
I was just thinking about a homing beacon myself. That will be great for the future, if a base is ever established.
As Imbrium alludes, a ""landing target miss"" can be a much bigger problem than an RUD. Especially if done like Beresheet's landing.
From this article, it appears that SpaceX is going to dominate the lunar cargo launch business, at least for now.
Yep. I'd say that's good starting rule of thumb. Very logical.
To borrow a concept, I think it's 'aspirational'. Very. Aspirational.
True, but worth noting that 'land at a precise location' and 'do not land on boulder/equipment' are quite differently achievable goals.
Falcon Heavy tossed an electric car(with human facsimile aboard) into solar orbit. I think it can handle this one. Last edited by daveishere on Fri May 31, 2019 5:12 pm
This shouldn't be a surprise. Not just price, but people are getting pretty confident in their reliability.
It may be worthwhile reviewing the definitions of ""precise"" and ""accurate"": A precise landing is one where the lander lands very near that spot every time. That spot may be nowhere near the target, however. An accurate landing is one where the lander lands near the target every time, with varying definitions of ""near"". Ideally we want a lander with both precise and accurate landings. I feel like there should be an XKCD comic explaining this (and which would be much funnier).
Agreed. Getting industry out of low earth orbit & extending it to the Moon is the next major leap in extending human civilization; By creating a Luna outpost, then a colony with a functional economy.
That might be getting a little ahead of ourselves. How about first we land a bunch of cheap landers and rovers, to get some ideas of where the people should go looking for usable materials.
Well, that and a good reason why anyone would want to live there for keeps. Visit? Sure. Stay for good? Convince me.
Just wait ‘til you have bad knees...1/6 gravity will be a godsend...hopefully.
At 66 I have bad everything. What I also have is a changing view out my window and a means to go out to a lovely park with fresh air, sunshine, a rushing stream and singing birds.
First commercial retail business on the Moon will be Starbucks. Calling it now.
Indeed. Can't wait for them to pour a thousand dollar cup of coffee in that gravity. Necessity is the mother of invention.
FedEx! Or would it be MoonEx then?
Fair enough. I don’t see cradle to grave habitation on the Moon for a very long time. Still, in time in the decades to come research stations w/ residents will be built on the Moon; which in a similar way has happened in Antartica & far northern settlements. - There are several permanent stations in Antartica with 1000 people living there in the winter. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Researc ...

In Antartica residents may stay up to 2 years. https://coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%2 ... rctica.php I figure the length of stay in Antartica would be the pattern with future residents on the Moon. Lunar residents would do their work for months up to a couple of years & then return to earth. Last edited by bb-15 on Fri May 31, 2019 6:03 pm

That's fun and all, until it ceases being a rover and turns itself into a lunar satellite. ""So, uh, we accidentally put our rover into lunar orbit. We're not really sure what to do yet, but the international community has declined our offer to hit it with a Dragon capsule to knock it back down. In the meantime we have the entertainment system playing a loop of Space Junk by Devo.""
Yeah, if the Moon ever gets colonized, it will need safety nets everywhere to prevent rovers going to orbit, or dogs while jumping after balls, etc. Edit: this is supposed to be a joke. I don't think of the cosmos to be like in The Little Prince. Last edited by nzod on Fri May 31, 2019 8:58 pm
Yet somehow it seems less aspirational than Elon's autonomous car goals. (Edit: in the sense that moon landings actually seem more realistic) Last edited by japtor on Fri May 31, 2019 8:03 pm
Presumably, one of these would serve as the local beacon for a later landing after first surveying the site.
Well, since Orbit Beyond actually claims 100 meters, the 1 km is likely an Eric Berger typo-boo-boo.

That's because we didn't have a rocket to toss Berasheet into a lunar orbit, or even a lunar transfer orbit. We had a rocket to toss the 4t PSN-6 into a geostationary transfer orbit, and the 500kg Berasheet was just along for the ride.
Now I’m wondering if there was a little known spinoff of Ice Road Truckers.
Not necessarily. Astrobotic was one of the Lunar Xprize frontrunners, and OrbitBeyond is partnering with Team Indus, another frontrunner, and Honeybee Robotics, which has operational experience with prior space probes.
I watched the test of the Omega first stage last night and apart from the nozzle seeming to explode late on, it looked fairly impressive. Not really knowing anything about solid rockets though I've been trying to educate myself and I've come up against one question; can anyone help? What's the difference between a solid rocket fuel and an explosive? To put it another way, if a solid propellant contains fuel and oxidiser, why doesn't it all burn immediately? I tried to think of wood or a candle, but I think these are fuels and require the oxidiser to come to them. Is it because the propellant is a mixture of two relatively stable substances (plus others) and an explosive is an inherently unstable substance? As an aside, given that this was very similar to a Space Shuttle booster (as I understand it) I was left wondering what Northrop Grumman were actually testing - is it a new propellant mixture? A new container?
Separate subject. you've got to love the Europa Clipper choice: ""Do we launch on a non existent rocket, or do we launch on an existing rocket and save $700 Million?""
Will the 2020 SLS launch be trampoline-based, or are they just sending a model of it to ISS on a Dragon?
Simple answer solid fuel is an explosive that is designed to burn slower, complicated answer involves things like fuel grain which is basically patterns in the mix which both make it function and make it expensive, however if there's a case rupture, it will explode, quite spectacularly
Solid rocket motors only burn on the surface of the propellant grain. Recall that you need three things for fire: fuel, oxidizer, and an ignition source. The ignition source during the burn is the previously burning propellant, which only affects the surface. High explosives ignite in an entirely different manner, via shockwave compression. The shockwave travels through the solid explosive at extremely high speeds, essentially igniting the whole thing at once. Gun propellants are not high explosives, and burn like solid rocket propellants only on the surface, but they are finely ground up so that they have an enormous surface area compared to the volume. Solid rocket motors are cast in large consolidated pieces with much less surface area.
The Omega test was a success? Sure looked like the nozzle blew itself to heck in the video. I guess the entire thing didn't go kaboom, so that could be considered some kind of success(?), but isn't the hard part of a solid rocket motor keeping the explosion controlled so it doesn't, for example, blow the nozzle up?
The official word from Northrop is that they observed the nozzle ""doing something a little strange that we need to go further look into"".
One might characterize leaving the immediate vicinity of the rocket in multiple discontinuous pieces as doing something a little strange, true.
The nozzle failed 122 seconds into the burn, just a few seconds before they ran out of propellant anyway. Armchair guess, they were consuming some protective ablator faster than expected. Had this happened on a launch, it might have had enough velocity to continue (like AV-064), but the damaged nozzle would have likely produced enough off-axis thrust to throw it off course and force range safety.
Just to give some numbers, the flame speed on this deflagrating motor is somewhere around 10mm/s. The flame speed on detonating explosives is 3-10km/s.
Another note is that the dividing line is a propagation velocity over the speed of sound in the medium (usually hundreds or low thousands of m/s). This means there is no real reaction ahead of the shockwave (other than some minor heating through radiation), which is why it goes up all at once. Detonation is also not limited to solids. A bad concentration of gasses can very much detonate, even if it tends not to be as intense. Rocket engines tend not to use detonation as it is hard on the equipment, but they are a subject of research and prototypes do exist.
They were testing one of those in what was basically a bunker under the engineering building when I was in undergrad. That thing was obscenely loud.
It uses a different fuel - HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) instead of the SRB's PBAN-APCP (polybutadiene acrylonitrile - ammonium perchlorate composite propellant). It's also using carbon composites instead of D6AC steel for the case. Those are technologies from the GEM boosters, so it's probably fair to think of Omega as a hybrid of the SRB and GEM.
Depends on who wrote the test objectives. If written/approved by the test department, a test was performed, rather than aborted and not performed. If written / approved by the systems engineers, it depends on if all the _applicable_ requirements were assessed and met. If written / approved by the design IPT, it depends on if it functioned/failed as intended or that sufficent data was collected to advance the design or validate models. The various sources of truth for making an assessment can be a source of internal confusion and external cynicism. Causes include internal conflicting higher level organization objectives like ""meet all test objectives"", ""100% verification"", ""test to failure"", or schedules that result in test plans and objectives having required submittal dates before design specifications (and their verification plans) are complete. These all assume good communication amongst systems engineering, design, and test. Any or all of these could be the source of the ""successful test"" rating. It is possible that public relations has several stakeholders telling them different, truthful, things (different viewpoints, depending on role and responsibility) and that they chose the one that matches their chosen narrative for the given forum.
A note on launchers for EC, the last D4H cores are being built and they are all spoken for, not to mention unless you want to make the trip much longer, rather than just a little longer, then you need expendable FH with a Star 48.
It might have been random turbulence or something with the compression introducing artifacts ahead of the event, but it seemed like there were some pulsations immediately before the nozzle failed. Might be normal burn instability that they just underestimated and need to beef up the nozzle to handle.
Just to add more nuance to the above replies: in some configurations, the solid rocket is a cylinder but with a long empty ""pipe"" section in the middle. Ignition ignites this surface and then it burns outwards from the core towards the rocket cylinder wall itself. There are other ways of conducting the burn. There are all kinds of issues beyond that. You want to arrange to maintain thrust to some spec. My stepdad got a patent on nozzle constriction at Aerojet back in the day which is another part of what makes solid rockets work. The physics is outside my competence but I think it maintains pressure inside and prevents explosions? Iirc there may also be gradients of chemical composition to further shape the burn. Maybe some lurking solid rocket engineer can expand more and correct misremembered stuff.
""Explode"" is a technically imprecise term, so practitioners in the field tend to avoid it unless defining terms or dealing with statutory requirements (e.g. DOT shipping labels). The terms ""explosive"" or ""Explode"" is used by the media and general public to cover any of: rapid burn, detonation, deflagration, RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly), burst (as in a pressure vessel rupture), flash-over, function (as in a bomb or its fuze) and others. General term that includes propellants and high explosives is ""energetics"".
It ""prevents explosions"" in the sense that it doesn't get blown off the back end of the rocket and rapidly vent the combustion chamber. Solid rocket propellant typically has a positive relation between pressure and burn rate. If you choke the flow with a nozzle, exhaust won't be able to escape the chamber, and chamber pressure will build. As chamber pressure builds, you burn faster, produce more exhaust, and build chamber pressure. If your nozzle falls off the end, aside from the massive performance loss from no longer having a proper flow-accelerating nozzle, the combustion itself will fizzle.
Likely not a gradient in the materials of the grain due to the manufacturing methods used with large motors, imo. Not sure. At any rate, large orbital boosters are dual use technology with respect to ITAR and may be proprietary or subject to other distribution restrictions, so public info on a site frequented by an international audience may be impacted.
Maybe they shouldn't use that batch of old nozzles they had that were certified by PMI.
I think there is just a large number of possible schemes. I read that some small sat outfit was trying a solid liquid hybrid. I think it was solid fuel and liquid oxidizer. Or maybe the reverse. It’s probably possible to make both types work. I was going to try to google it up again, but damn, this hybrid solid uncooked pasta rocket is so much better: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tHzsZkh3i ... fullscreen
Is the Star 48 certified for the FH flight loads? I hadn't heard that any Falcon launches had integrated to payloads with solid kick motors.
That was clearly a major failure of the divergent portion of the nozzle. It is less catastrophic than a casing failure but would have caused a loss of thrust vectoring control authority as well as shortfall in delivered impulse. If it is a design issue rather than a manufacturing defect it can be solved in a straight forward manner with a more robust but heavier ablative nozzle.
Ah, that would explain the post test call-out I heard saying... ""You have to talk a little louder.""
The two Skyline movies use these for propulsion. It was neat seeing it in the movie and then reading about the actual research it is based on. So there you have it kids: the Skyline movies are educational! Ack, now I am second guessing myself, maybe it was the other invasion movie that also: turned LA into a war zone?
Solid rocket fuel is a solid rather than powder and only reacts at a flame front at its surface which eats away at the fuel body. A high explosive is also a solid but reacts by propagation of a detonation wave through the body at much higher speed than the material of the explosive moves. There is some overlap. A large mass of high explosive can be set on fire and will burn peacefully but under the right conditions a large flame front can transition suddenly into a detonation. The physics of this transition is poorly understood. Conversely a mass of some types of solid rocket fuel can be coaxed into detonation with a sufficiently violent initiator. Most solid rocket explosions though is a fault in the fuel grain or partial blockage of the nozzle causing the pressure inside to increase beyond the strength of the motor casing causing it to burst violently and throw burning chunks of fuel in all directions.
Omega test (20:12 is where T-6 begins). Nozzle performs an overly ablative unscheduled rapid disassembly at ~ T +119 seconds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MTM-AN ... .be&t=2210
Not intense? I think this shows a concentraction of gasses can be quite intense. Also, the Germans were successfully firing pusejets (V-1) at Britain during WWII.
Unfortunately for Boeing a control anomaly in an Atlas 5 flight last year is drawing some unwanted attention ahead of OFT. https://twitter.com/joroulette/status/1 ... 2343829504
The pulsed deflagration in a V-1 or other similar pulsejet and the pulsed detonation in these experimental engines are two vastly different things. Pulsejets typically don't even have compressors, so they're operating at ram-air pressures just slightly above atmospheric. That's why they get such pitiful efficiency. A PDE is going to produce shock pressures far in excess of what it sees in its compressor. Last edited by wagnerrp on Fri May 31, 2019 8:32 am
That's a frightening thought...
It is relative, which on the low end is still going to be pretty energetic when talking about detonations in most cases. The relative intensity when detonations happen in solids is due to how much material you can pack into a small volume. A pulsejet is not necessarily using pulse detonation. In the case of the V-1, I think it was just pulsed deflagration.
Launch services? If you aren't on a coast then basically all you can do is launch sounding rockets and do sub-orbital elevator fun rides for rich people.
Unless you're doing air launch, on something big enough to make it out to open ocean before deploying.
There were pulsations the whole duration of the burn, it was just more readily visible from some directions than others. What are the odds of a chunk of propellant breaking loose and impacting the nozzle?

WANT. I have the Saturn V model sitting prominently on top of a bookshelf in my living room; upgrading the lander from the tiny little version in that set would be great.
I will have to make a trip to the LEGO store this weekend
oh, they will get your money
Article says roughly 20x20x20 cm, so not huge compared to the Saturn V model.
I am lucky to have a Lego store where I live too, so fun to go in there
I don't need this. I don't need this. I don't need this. *reaches for credit card*
But dangerous, right? I mean, have you seen that huge Millennium Falcon? I only have so much willpower.
As with the Saturn V (which I see sitting on my bookcase here at work), I really appreciate the level of effort which they've put into making each sub-component as accurate as possible by itself. These things are damn near teaching aides if you've got kids around. (of course, there's an XKCD for that: this is the part which falls off last, etc. etc.)
I happily built the Saturn V two christmases ago while watching Bob Ross. I look forward to building this one when it releases.
the falcon is way over the top, but yes indeed, I cant not deny that thoughts of fuck it, just buy it, have gone though my head
Still cheaper than the real thing :-) Too much to hope, I suppose, that it has a tiny AGC? Last edited by Antron Argaiv on Thu May 30, 2019 8:16 am
That fifth shot in the gallery gives a whole new meaning to ""Tranquility Base"" I have the Saturn V at home; I think this one would have to go in my office. Remember kids, Father's Day is coming!
I ordered the Saturn V just before it sold out that first time. $120, 2000 piece set, monstrous. Was and is amazing. I'm not feeling this set for $100 though. If they had said 80, I'd be really fucking tempted. Anything less and I'd instabuy. Also, please stop tempting my wallet, Ars. I hate spending money. Why would you do this to me?

Thankfully this is part of the Creator line and has some realism and complexity like the Saturn V, I hope and assume they will do more space stuff like this. I'll buy them all! A few days ago several items including an SLS and Lunar Gateway appeared on the Lego shop site as ""coming soon"" but have since been removed. They were part of the City line and are smaller and less complex than Creator. I had mixed feelings. More Creator space stuff please!
Arse! I spent a small fortune picking up the previous Lego Lunar Lander set from ebay last year. It was one of those sets that has gradually appreciated over time and ended up costing far more than it ever did new! Ah well. That won't stop me picking it up to sit alongside Saturn V, Shuttle and Curiosity rover sets. And by happy coincidence, it's my birthday on the day of release - so happy birthday to me, and I know what I'm buying myself this year!
My wife got me the Saturn V set for Christmas this year. It was so much fun to build w/ my kids! It was one of the best Christmas presents I've had.
What, no product link for me to hammer?! Also, kindly go vote for this LEGO Falcon 9 design on the Ideas site, because I desperately need one for my desk.
Looks fantastic I just finished the Apollo kit last week.
Oh good, I can build my own moon landing hoax set!
Welllllll, that's pretty much an insta-buy. I'm not really much for LEGO these days, having sold off most of my Star Wars sets, but I'm a sucker for the NASA stuff.
Would it be gauche to leave your sister’s wedding early to get to a LEGO Store to buy this? Definitely not asking for me.
Oh man this led me down a rabbithole.

Probably. Do it. Dooooooo iiiiiiiiiit.
I'm throwing my money at the screen but nothing is happening!
If it is the groom who leaves early, it could be a problem.
Be careful. Poe's law is a dangerous one. One of my long-term customers is a LEGO dealer. I dropped him an email, and some time in the future a lunar lander will appear on my desk.
One giant scream of pain in the middle of the night for parentkind.
Then again.. If he's on his sisters wedding and he's the groom there's bound to be more problems.
I looked on Amazon and didn't see it. I'm guessing it's not available to order yet. As for the falcon 9, Lego's already reviewed and declined a Falcon Heavy (o two?); so even if that one hits 10k the odds of it becoming a set are very low. Fortunately several people have posted instructions and part lists so you can order aftermarket parts to build one. Last edited by DanNeely on Thu May 30, 2019 8:47 am

This is the third NASA Apollo LEM model by LEGO, preceded by: * 565 Moon Landing (1976), 364 parts. Predates the color grey, the RCS cluster, and the Minifig. * 10029 Lunar Lander (2003), 453 parts. One of a series of space hardware sets co-branded with the Discovery Channel.

Hang on, let's make that more appropriate:
Ha ha, no. I will be utterly shocked if Russia ever develops and successfully flies a new launcher, much less gets it to the ISS or the Moon. Russia is corrupt, nearly broke, and their engineering talent is fleeing or has already fled the country.
so they got powerpoint programs too, who knew
I hear they're going to be sending cosmonauts to Mars on a magical space unicorn by 2040, with Magical Space Unicorn Heavy Block 1 going into service the following year.
It looks like ""Super Thrust"" is the new name for the superheavy Soyuz 5 that Anatoly Zak wrote about a little over a year ago. Rogozin referred to it as ""Yenisei"" in a tweet last February.
is it just me or is this VERY inspired by the recently unveiled US moon program? Single use heavy lifter, inflatable tech, similar looking lander etc? Time frame is a bit behind but so will the SLS etc be as well by the time it’s ready (if it will be)? Also, a lot of Russian tech presentations seems to be computer generated rather than actual hardware. This particularly so, but maybe they’re fooling someone? Last edited by Deranged on Tue May 28, 2019 3:21 pm
Yeah... nyet.
Perhaps Elon can send up a shipment of trampolines for them to rendezvous with to take them from LEO to TLI. Yeah, I'm gonna be enjoying the schadenfreude on the trampoline thing for the next 10-20 years.
Their constituents. Much like Fox News viewers here in America, there is a substantial subset of Russians who do not care if what they're being sold is truth. They just want some propaganda to point at while deriding critics. No one outside Russia is going to take a single iota of this as a serious proposal when the whole country has turned into a failed petrostate with technical competence that dwindles with each passing year.
I don't doubt they can. But it feels like due to current political reasons it's being talked about now so a certain people in charge feels the need to militarize the space agency. Because you know that whole space based invasion from that lunar base they'll build.
Any plan by any nation that doesn't involve distributed launch and in orbit refueling is at best a flags and footprints mission and more likely limited to only powerpoint landings.
Is reading that hard. He was talking in the context of developing a new launcher and spacecraft something Russia has done horribly at over the last decade or more. I wouldn't under estimate Russian's capability to get to the moon. after all, they delivered the first man into space.[/quote] Yeah almost 60 years ago and they have been at best treading water for the last 30+. Saying Russia is not likely to build multiple new rockets, landers, and spacecraft and fund the incredible cost of a lunar crewed mission is being realistic.
How much did the PowerPoint slide cost? Sucks that such a once upon a time space power will be sneered at when they talk space. Hopefully things get better for Russia. The world actually needs them. The more nations trying to get to space...The better for whole space enthusiast community.
That was almost 60 years ago. In that time, they went broke, got democracy, got taken over by their own Russian Mob oligarchs and went even more broke. 60 years ago, they had communism, and didn't much care about budgets (this is partially what led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which, by the way, included the countries, and resources, of the Soviet Bloc to almost all of which Russia no longer has ready access). There is no way in hell Russia has the means to get to the moon today. What they have is a propaganda machine on par with, or perhaps more pervasive than, what the old Soviet Union used to have. Only they ""do it with computers"". Back in the day, the Soviet Union LIED about its military capabilities, standard of living, technological abilities and many other things. Today, Russia does the same thing only they use computers to ""show"" what they have. Their brain drain is even worse than it was under the former regime. None of this should be a surprise, since Putin has delusions that he can bring back the former glory of the old Soviet Union (it never was glorious, to be honest - gritty yes, glorious, not hardly) while the oligarchs of the country rape its financial resources. Until there's hardware that flies, and doesn't explode or catastrophically fail, they're little more than a bunch of kids in the back yard scraping off match heads and trying to pack them into a rocket engine while creating CGI videos and images of what they want other people to think they're going to do.
I feel bad for them. They went from the clear leader in terms of space and rocket technology, to losing the race to the moon, to now essentially the laughing stock of the space community.
Except they've never sent any human beyond beyond low earth orbit EVER, and that was when frankly they were a much more capable space power. They've not developed a new spacecraft that actually has carried human beings since Soyuz. Which first flew in 1967. Heck, even Japan & Europe both have more of an un crewed presence beyond low earth orbit/have had more engineering experience with developing brand new spacecraft to a finished product after the fall of the Soviet Union.

I suspect that everyone has finally realized that the secret Nazi base on the dark side of the moon is fact, not fantasy. (But seriously, folks, the various powers are all worrying about one of them getting established on the moon and, in some way, being able to use that situation to overwhelming advantage. It's a more capable and serious reiteration of the space race of the 60's.)
Well, better late than never I guess.
Inspired in the same way the US 'Moon Program' is inspired - politics and hot air. It's not like we have a lock on this particular set of commodities.
Didn't they have to permanently take one of their aircraft carriers out of service because lacked the facilities for it? And they have an economy smaller than Germany's? If so, lol at them going to the moon. This is just more propaganda for Papa Putin to rally the citizenry. If China gave this presentation, I'd be worried. Russia? Haha.

I hope that I’m still be around for the 2045 documentary Space Race 2: Electric Bugaloo.
Despite what some claim, delta-v is NOT the salient metric.
The aircraft carrier was done in by its repair facilities, when a dockyard crane fell on the boat.
Yes, Russia has some of the best rocket engines in the world, but they've not developed anything new that got off the drawing board since before the fall of the Soviet Union (ISS sort of counts, but not really because the Russian components were largely funded by the United States). If all you have is past glories to point to, while the rest of the world leaves you behind. Well, that's not enough. The RD-180 engine will soon be replaced by American rocket engines, and then Russian lovers wont even be able to point to that.
Well, no. Russia has the second most advanced missile / space program on the planet. Well, maybe third behind Arienspace. Or maybe tied with fourth. But still, they can and do loft things into space on a regular basis. Occasional screwups notwisthanding. Given enough money and a reasonable amount of time, it's not farfetched to think they can use their history and current technology base to improve rapidly. They have a bunch of pretty smart people. And Putin can divert a couple of billion towards Roscosmos. I don't really see that happening (mostly since Putin & Co haven't seen fit to do this yet) but politics is weird. So are people.
Exactly my thought. Let the powerpoint space race to the moon begin!
I'm sure US Space Force frigate USSS Donald J. Trump will take them out.
A couple billion won't even put humans in LEO with a clean-sheet design.
I guess they have to get more of that sweet, sweet bio-metal.
No need when we'll have actual Neutral Particle Beam weapons on satellites.
You mean Polonium?
Perhaps, several couples....hehe. I don't see how Russia can afford such endeavour even with a longer timeline. Unless, they want to declare a case of emergency in their space program.
It is debatable whether they have ever been a clear leader past Sputnik. US quickly developed a big lead in satellite technologies and was either ahead or at least not far behind in other areas.
Another lesson, boys and girls. Don't do crack. You'll end up with delusions like poor Rogozin here. Pity him. He needs help.
One way?
I'm not fan of Russia, but then I'm not fan of delusional claims that the NASA is in a good place and way ahead. You mention the ISS. The NASA was unable to send any astronauts to the ISS on their own spacecraft ever since Space Shuttles were retired. Maybe later this year SpaceX will be able to, but given that they've had a setback testing Dragon 2 crew escape system it might get delayed. Then it's Boeing's Atlas V, you know, one with the Russian rocket engines. Note how NASA operated spacecraft aren't even in the picture.
I realize there are a lot of contributors here, but Ken the Bin is a prolific contributor. Thanks!
I hope SpaceX manages to kill Block Buy 2.0, once BO is flying that will kill ULA and save billions
Since Starship seems to be the highest risk portion of what SpaceX is attempting, why don't they just develop a ""simple"" expendable second stage for SuperHeavy. Putting a raptor powered second stage on super heavy, i would think, make it far more powerful than SLS and any of the other proposed rockets. (someone smarter than me please correct me if I am wrong) As a complete outsider, it seems that Super Heavy development should be fairly straightforward for them, with Starship having all of the novel/crazy tech. So, separate the two and you can have a Super Heavy powered expendable 2nd stage in orbit next year, making all of the ""schedule risk"" for spacex disappear and, as a bonus, removing the last small fig leaf for SLS to have a reason for existence. (Note: I am not saying stop working on starship, but even with starship, there will be some deep space missions where an expendable 2nd stage may make sense)
Earth-to-Sky announced a contract last week to launch 120 cubesats into SSO in March 2021.
Or offer up a interim Draco or Merlin based kick stage. The Starship orbiter is not something that makes sense to expend often, only on the rare interplanetary (Luna counts) mission. However USAF did say that refueling would be an acceptable way to cover Class C, and as a result there would be no reason to dedicate develop resources to such a thing. Class C is heavy direct GSO for those who are wondering, something that no version of BFR can do in a single launch
On Earth to Sky's rocket, why the heck is their initial offering a tricore? That makes no sense whatsoever. The whole point of a tricore is to get a heavier launcher out of development of a smaller vehicle.
Quote: Engineer faked inspection reports for Falcon rockets. a little more on this: https://www.democratandchronicle.com/st ... 771082002/ nice that they caught it quickly. Quote: SQA Services, a SpaceX subcontractor, ""provides multiple quality assurance functions within the aerospace and defense manufacturing industries,"" a release said. In January 2018, an internal audit by SQA, which was ordered by SpaceX, found a number of instances of falsified source inspection reports and non-destructive testing certifications from PMI for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flight critical parts, the criminal complaint alleges. Representatives from SpaceX then told PMI of the issues. Smalley told investigators he forged the signatures of at least three SQA employees, the complaint said. He also used their quality stamps without permission. Smalley admitted he didn't sign the signatures himself or use their quality stamps. Instead, he used his company-issued laptop to ""copy and paste the signatures and stamps onto the falsified source inspection reports,"" the complaint said. how one employee can ruin a company Quote: SpaceX then ended its partnership with PMI and PMI subsequently closed. PMI averaged $200,000 per month in SpaceX business. That resulted in 35 people losing their jobs, the complaint said.
How valid is the contract? That is to say are there links between the sat op and the lsp?
This isn't really directly related, but I just want to vent a petty irritation of mine that's been triggered a lot over the past week. Is going to the moon ""deep space""? Really? I barely think about deep space as inside the solar system. I know, I know we're never going to go galactic in our lifetimes (barring a miracle) so you set your definitions based on where you can actually go, but still going to the moon is ""deep space""? We're barely going out into the bay in a paddle boat. /rant. Feel free to down vote to oblivion.
Has SpaceX ever said anything more about how Starship will be able to handle satellite releases? Are they going to have large bay doors like the Shuttle did and have a mini kick stage assembly do the delevery, or is it going to be a smaller hatch and they pop them out the side one at a time with the whole ship adjusting for each release?
The main reason probably is that there is very little actual demand for expandable heavy lift. I guess if SpaceX would get a contract for flying such a thing for a handful of launches they might build it, but they haven't. Starship has the advantage of being actually useful for launching basically everything for (if it works out as planned) very low costs and as such enabling regular and sustained business with good margins. Besides, turning Starship into an expendable second stage isn't hard. Just leave out the heat shield, wings and legs. In nearly every single other aspect you'd need to build such a stage exactly the same way.
For “deep space”, even an expendable second stage is going to be way to massive. You want to keep your dry mass down as much as possible, and something that just spent 6km/s getting to orbit isn’t the way to do that. You’d be better off with a disposable third stage carried as payload.
Thank you!
The JFK Library website lists the seminar date as ""Wednesday JUNE 19"", not July 19.
That’s the “chomper” design. Basically a Space Shuttle style cargo bay at the nose, but a single piece hinged at the rear rather than two pieces hinged in the sides.
For interplanetary missions, you would want a kick stage, or to refuel an expendable stage in LEO. But to simply replace SLS and DIVH, a shortened expendable upper stage sans heat shield, legs, etc would be relatively simple and quick to develop.
Poking deeper, I don't see any direct links but I still think it's not all that solid, since I can't find record of the customer (Delta Satellite Solutions) having done any previous payload coordination. It looks like it might be two new players trying to drum up interest in their services by the launch provider being able to say they have a payload coordinator and the payload coordinator being able to say they have a committed launch platform.
When will they learn that this isn't an industry where moving product faster makes a significant improvement in sales and that doing so at the cost of quality is a sure fire way to lose all the sales?
I was thinking of it more as a system that would be quick to develop and fly, removing all ""schedule risk"" from SpaceX, and also removing all justification for SLS. Long term, it would have minimal use, but, would be a political coup in today's environment. A partially reusable ship with more lift capacity than SLS that can launch heavier payloads today.
It would have to be awfully massive payload to warrant a disposable Starship and refueling versus just a cheap kick stage. A squat Falcon upper deployed fully fueled in LEO would do 20t to Jupiter, or 6t on on NH's trajectory.
According to this https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com ... 18JA026136 we haven't left Earth's atmosphere yet.
I agree. My rule of thumb would be if you look out a window and can't see earth with your mark I eyeball, even as a pale blue dot, then you are in deep space. I think some NASA folks use deep space as a more folksy version of BLEO.
It looks like a 1.5 stage. I don't see an upper stage on the center core. If they can use simple pressure-fed ground started engines, and what looks like metal stages, that might be cheaper than some of the multistage, pumped engine, composite bodies smallsat launchers.
What if that window is just facing away from Earth?
Here is someone who played too much D&D. Or a contract law practitioner.
It also doesn't use a common core. The center stage is fatter, longer, and looks like it might have four engines vs. two on the boosters.
Yes. But tricores never have truly ""common"" center cores anyway. Depending how they make the stages, this might work just as well.
Earth to Sky's booster doesn't look particularly falcon heavyesque to me. Their side boosters are significantly smaller than the center core; visually it looks more like an build a rocket with 2 long skinny strapons.
Uh oh. Some folks, er counterrevolutionaries, are a hair's breadth away from a re-education camp.

And without the leg/fins, heat shield, or SL Raptors it should be a pretty cheap stage. Possibly in the $40-$50M range, or maybe half that if they strip down an old Starship to make it. Not as cheap as a Falcon upper stage, and certainly not cheap enough to enable Starship's $5M per launch goal, but in the general scheme of interplanetary launch systems it's pretty cheap.
Earth-to-Sky are one of the shaky looking companies that popped up to contend the DARPA launch challenge, along with people like Pythom and the now defunct Aphelion Orbitals. I don't expect them to stick around too long now they've not passed the qualification step.
It's not a tricore, those are just boosters (think of Soyuz). They probably need that because pressure fed engines need heavy tanks, reducing the speed you can get out of a single stage.
I ran across something interesting in Earth to Sky's Customer Payload Handbook. The stated launch site is Wallops Pad 0B, which is the same pad that Vector is supposed to launch from. The Handbook also says they're using hydrolox engines built with additive manufacturing from Inconel 718. It calls the engines Ashton 12K, which I can't find any information on.
They are going to need a fully operational and qualified engine running at spec pretty soon. No pressure BO, take your time.

This is such a mind blowing lapse in ethical judgement. Space is hard, and this only makes it worse. Not only did he fail to do the job right he was hired for, it entangles other people who are prevented from doing their job by bypassing them all together, and endanger and exposes the customer to risk and liability. Rockets often don't fail in nice, friendly ways. And in the end, everyone lost their job and the company died. Ugh. [face palm]
Re: ""Why didn't SpaceX just bid a Raptor upper stage or disposable kick stage for Falcon Heavy?"", I think the main reason is that modifying the Falcon Heavy isn't part of their long-term plan. In the end, Falcon Heavy is at best a stepping-stone and at worst a detour from their actual Mars aspirations, so they don't want to spend time and money making it better: they want to accelerate Starship so it can replace the entire Falcon line.

[face palm] Making a quick buck at the expense of everyone is a time honored tradition. Same thing happened some 140 years ago when they built the Brooklyn Bridge. From https://erenow.net/common/the-great-bri ... dge/20.php Quote: Inspection of the wire was carried on by Paine and his assistants at Haigh’s big brick mill at Red Hook, near the Atlantic Docks. Once the wire was passed, it was loaded onto wagons and hauled up to the bridge. But in June it was found that rejected wire was also getting to the bridge. Wire that had been accepted, but held in the mill overnight, would be replaced before morning by rejected wire, which then went off to the bridge. The trick was discovered by secretly marking the good wire. Haigh was informed of the discovery and given a strong warning. Paine was assured there would be no more of that, but he remained suspicious. The rule from then on was that no more wire was to be inspected than could be delivered on that same day. But a little later it was noticed that the great pile of rejected wire, instead of increasing as it should have, with rings failing to pass inspection every day, was growing steadily smaller. The bad wire was going somewhere obviously and the assumption was that it was going to the bridge. But how, since all departing wagonloads were being carefully watched to see that they carried good wire only? The solution, the engineers decided, had to be that wagonloads were being switched on route, somewhere between Red Hook and the bridge. Quote: “The distressing point of this affair,” Roebling told Murphy, “is that all the rejected wire which has come to the Bridge has been worked into the cables, and cannot be removed.” How long Haigh had been practicing his little scheme, Roebling could not say. “We know that it has been going on for two months, and the probability is that it extends as far back as last January.” According to the inspectors’ books, nearly five hundred tons of wire had been rejected to date. Most of this, Roebling suspected, had gone into the cables. To determine the precise quantity would be extremely difficult he said. “An engineer who has not been educated as a spy or detective is no match for a rascal.”
Three years ago, just three, this phrasing would have been inconceivable. Amazing. I'm looking forward to seeing their launch cadence go way, way up as they spin up Starlink. Here's to a successful deployment tonight.
Unfortunately I won't be able to watch it live due to the timing but I have been looking forward to seeing the deployment mechanism in action since the first launch attempt. It would be awesome to know that the monthly payments for regular internet service are truly used for funding of a city on Mars. Awesome enough that I would pay a little bit more for it than for my current line. I wish you the best of luck SpaceX.
Thanks for the heads up! would have totally missed it.
I have wanted to buy something of SpaceX for a long time. Internet would be great. Do they have a merch shop? Maybe I can get a tshirt.... Edit: yep. They do. https://shop.spacex.com/ Last edited by Bmo on Thu May 23, 2019 5:42 pm
2130 CDT, should be able to catch this one, supposing it doesn't have to cancel. Awesome.
This may have been answered in a previous thread, but I thought most of the talk about using Faldon to launch Starlink was that the fairing was volume constrained. It seems to me SpaceX must have solved that particular problem. Anyone have an idea of what the change was?
$20 per month for internet?!? Yes please! (4.34b internet users @ 3% =131.5m starlink users, at $19 bucks per month= $30bn per year) RIP all current ISP’s.
They made small flat satellites and packed them like sardines. I am really looking forward to watching the deployment.... (odd thing to look forward to...)
If it comes down with the heavy load still on it, I can pretty well guarantee it.
They basically have no internal volume. They're under a foot thick, and most of that is unfolding panels. See image from twitter. Spoiler: show
I'm not so sure about RIP yet. How many concurrent Netflix streams can this system handle?
If it comes down with the heavy load still on it, it will be coming down nose first. There won't be anything the fins or engines could do to right it. Last edited by wagnerrp on Thu May 23, 2019 6:18 pm
My guess is that removing the traditional decoupler mechanism and letting them fly off on their own saved some space. Though I don’t know if THAT is what made the difference, it must have made A difference. Funnily enough I just used a similar method of letting my ‘little ones’ go in KSP for my Mun relay network. Ps. Getting those relay says in near-perfect synced orbits was a pain. I should’ve gotten the StationKeeping mod _before_ I spent an evening on that! Back to you SpaceX! May the odds be ever in your favor, and may Jeb not tinker with your satellites!
Isn't the FCC also requiring them to launch X satellites in Y years to keep their transmission licensees? It might be the case its better to start now, while they wait for the BFR.
There were concerns when it was estimated they could launch 20-30 at a time with Falcon 9. Now that they're launching double the optimistic predictions... 40 launches in 6 years shouldn't be too tough. Now their push seems to be to get the thing operational and bringing in funding for development of Starship as soon as possible. Last edited by wagnerrp on Thu May 23, 2019 6:23 pm

Yes, that was kind of my point. 30000 pounds of satellites immediately preceding two stages of angry Falcon. That would definitely qualify as a RUD; indeed it might redefine it. If it starts going off course, the range safety officer is going to blow it into tiny bits. There won't be nose.
No, not really, unless something goes wrong like running out of TEP or RP-1 or LOX or something breaks. Yes, it's coming in hot after boosting a payload like that, but they have the numbers that say they can land it, otherwise they wouldn't risk damage to the OCISLY. Anyone know when A Shortfall of Gravitas is going to be ready?

Relevant: Spoiler: show
More than enough. We're talking backbone level of bandwith.
I believe the FTS is safed by the time they get to first stage separation anyway.
I'm always struck by what a clever business move Starlink is. Not only does it spin up a nice revenue stream on its own, but it's the perfect buffer against the vagaries of the launch biz. If you want to bring down launch costs, you need to manufacture cores and upper stages and engines at a fairly high, consistent rate. But that almost guarantees that you'll over-produce when the orders go soft (as they seem to be doing right now). So how to you get the economies of scale without the inventory risk? You become your own best customer! Of course, if the launch biz spikes so much that you can't get your constellation deployed inside the license constraints, then you have a problem. So it's nice to be working on a new launch platform that's almost guaranteed to have a pretty slow ramp for commercial business. If you can't find an F9 to launch your Starlinks on, there will almost certainly be a Starship available. Very clever.
Nope. The FTS for the first stage is safed shortly before landing. The FTS for the second stage is safed shortly before it reaches orbit. You can hear the FTS safing callouts on some of the launch broadcasts.
Uh, sigh. The heavy load would be the fuel that spectacularly exits the rocket. The payload -the sats- will continue on to orbit, they won't be part of the landing.
Forum access removed. Regular denizens: Thanks for minimizing the engagement.
While F9 delivers the freight the development of its successor marches on. Musk says aim to produce a Raptor every 3 days by summer. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1131426671393820675 Hopes vacuum Raptor testing to begin in 4 months. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1131623298112974848 Expects vacuum Raptor to be at least 370 but hoping for 380. Thrust and throttle range similar to sea leve Raptor. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1131438642457587713 Somewhere right now BO and AJR executives are quietly weeping.
It is interesting watching my next ISP being created.
I'm kinda surprised that satellites haven't been deployed this way before. Is this truly a new idea?
Here's to hoping SpaceX and Starlink succeed tonight.
Nope. The FTS on F9 is autonomous. The F9 blows itself up if it sees itself leaving its allowed flight corridor. This reduces the work load on the range and allows more frequent launches. AFAIK all new U.S. launchers are going this way.
Well, it's ""only"" 60 satellites, and using a heavy would have little point because that's all of them they can fit in there. Are we really sure about the 18.5 tons thing (i.e. are we sure it's metric tons and not short tons)? Falcon 9 block 5 has been stated to be able to deliver 22MT to LEO sure, but this isn't LEO exactly. If so, they've done a remarkable job cramming the fairing close to as full as it can possibly be, both on volume and mass.
Based on that picture, they've apparently ordered it from the Borg.
So its name will probably always be 'One of one""?
That makes sense, as resistance to Gateway is futile.
First question: can it be refueled?
The low bidder. They were going with the Pakleds but no one could figure out what ""We need things to make us go"" meant.
The only good thing about the PPE is that it could be moved to a less stupid orbit in the future as it is self contained (navigation, guidance, telemetry, power generation, rcs and primary engines). Hell you could use it as a (slow) tug. Last edited by Statistical on Thu May 23, 2019 4:37 pm
*spoken mournfully* Huntsville, when the pork flowed.
On the positive side, this shows we're going back to the Moon in 2024. Aww, who am I kidding? Not happening in this universe.
Even if not, given how close the gateway’s architecture seems to be to ISS, it likely could be reboosted by the supply vehicles.
Though being fair, an SEP propulsion/power module is, on its own, not a bad thing to have designed and built. It just sucks that it's only being built to justify a mountain of pork.
Congrats to SSL - they could use some good news!
I certainly hope so. For $375M that thing better still be working in 20+ years. It looks like the baseline plan is for it to dock with the ESPRIT module which contains extra xenon so it has some refueling capability unsure if that can work independent of ESPRIT. Last edited by Statistical on Thu May 23, 2019 4:41 pm
There's potentially not even a whole lot to design here, as it's being built on their SSL-1300 platform (Maxar is formerly MDA, owning Space Systems/Loral).
Not that I disagree, but $375M seems like a bargain compared to the insane costs of any piece of SLS.
I thought $375M was weirdly low, considering how much some spacecraft have cost recently, though I guess it is on the same order of price as a high-end Geosat, and there shouldn't be any exotic requirements.
Remind me again...why is the Gateway necessary for the Artemis plan? I don't even mean ""why are we putting things into NRHO?"", I know it's because of the SLS. But do you really need a Power & Propulsion Module and Habitation Module in NRHO? What's wrong with simply putting the Ascent, Descent, and Transfer modules there (using commercial launch vehicles), assembling them as appropriate, having the Orion capsule (launched on SLS) rendezvous with them, transfering crew from the Orion to the Ascent module, using the Transfer module to move the whole thing to LLO, detaching Ascent and Descent from Transfer, going to the surface with Ascent+Descent, returning with Ascent only, using Transfer to get back to NRHO, and then shuttling crew back to Orion for the return trip? And if the Gateway's purpose is in-orbit refueling, the usual comment about ""just send up the refueling pod on a per-mission basis, we don't need permanent gas stations in space quite yet"" applies.
Is the design good enough to sell to the next station project? I would sure like us to get to the point where modules aren't always 4 to 6 years out (or even 12 to 18 months, like they are promising here, I'll believe it when I see it).
http://sslmda.com/html/1300_series_platform.php Huh, okay. So what exactly are they even developing here? Adding a docking port to attach to the rest of the station? A refueling port, presumably? I wonder how much one of these things costs ""off the shelf"".
Yes, yes it can.
The pessimist in me says it can't work on its own and ESPRIT will be 4 to 6 years out.
I read that as ""extra venom"" at first. Which is apropos, since I vehemently hate the entire Gatehole concept. I need to contact my congress-critters and tell them to vote no on this debacle. (amusingly, my auto-correct now is trained on gatehole).
In case you haven't seen it yet here is the NASA propaganda video ""We Are Going"" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl6jn-DdafM Cynicism aside, my teenagers are super excited about the plans to go back to the Moon. There is a chance it may even happen in their lifetimes.

I really wish it was that simple. You would not believe the amount of oversight/bureaucracy that goes into designing/building anything for the government. Complicating that is once the program starts, they expect to be able to change anything at will without any costs impacts. I mean you can be 2/3 through a design with a whole series of trade studies/analysis/simulations complete and the government changes the requirements on you and they expect no/minimal cost impacts. Or the government will spends $1000s of dollars asking you to change PowerPoint fonts for them before they take a contractor brief to their boss. You wouldn't believe the amount of unproductive paperwork/meetings that occur on government programs. You know - the joys of bureaucracy. As for an OTS dock, well - what happens to the structural integrity of the module once you install the dock? You'll do an analysis and show what changes you have to make and the impacts, then you'll have a host of SETA (Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance) contractors that are trying to justify their jobs - tell you that you did it all wrong.
Unimatrix 0. You will comply.
If you take a step back and realize that this program has some consistency with the Obama administration's NASA plans, it seems that we might be reaching a point of consistency between one administration and the next. Honestly, regardless of the plan, consistency between administrations is what is needed at NASA. I do believe in the brains of the core at NASA, contractors aside. They are super smart individuals capable of carrying out any vision for the space program they want. You all can argue about the utility of the vision, but if there is a consistency between administrations for long enough to let them actually carry out the vision, the good people at NASA will get it done. I am hopeful that, one way or another, we might be getting to a point where they have vision enough to do that. They do seem to be moving faster on this ""moon by 2024"" idea than anything else I've seen them move on in the last 15 years (SLS included).
So, am I correct in understanding that the Gateway is to reside in the Earth/moon L1?
Politics is the art of the possible ....
Then we do what exactly ?
With another module attached it would probably be too heavy to be practical as a tug.
We are, by our very nature, explorers. While we cannot hunt, trap, or forage for food and furs, we will prospect. First will be simple outposts, then when a place that is more advantageous, a settlement. Since the moon is such an inhospitable place, we will have government backing and support, just like in the westward expansion days. As such we will give it a suitable name, like Fort Courage.
Genuine question: Has Blue Origin completed any flights of comparable magnitude which have not been tests? I'm not meaning to criticize. I love having such North American competition in rocket launches, but I can't seem to find any info about how the company is funded, other than Jeff Bezos and government help.
Last time I briefly looked into this, the effects of radiation were predicted to slightly increase cancer incidence, something like 3% increase in risk of cancer on a round trip journey to Mars (number might be off). Basically it sounds like a non-issue, since I'm sure you'll find plenty of people willing to slightly increase their risk of cancer to go to another planet (or moon). Longer term, I'm guessing we'll have a cure for cancer by the time any significant number of people have to deal with deep space radiation.
Build a pool.
Comparable to what? Blue has a flying rocket, but it is about 1/40th the size needed to launch this module.
'Conquering' and settling is one thing. Science of the Moon is far from done. There are advantages to be able to be present at the site compared to robots only. Robots could also be repaired if needed. In addition long term habitat and a wide variety of other research could be conducted there.
Just re-posting this with an update from the last gateway article I will now go through every augment I've seen positive for the gateway, and refute it. * ""We need it for landing on moon."" - NASA's new plan for speeding up development shows you don't. They have the gateway only be the docking port for the first few missions, and just use it for transferring to the lander... when the lander and the Orion can dock to each other. * ""Astronauts can control rovers on the surface from there."" - There is a 2 second delay from Earth for radio communication to the moon. At space camp it took us around 5 minutes to get used to controlling robots with that delay. * It can be a fueling station for fuel produced on the moon."" - It makes no sense to build an orbital depot for fuel you haven't figured out where or how to mine and refine on the moon's surface. - Also, it's in the wrong orbit for that. - Also, it makes no sense to make a big dumb refrigerated tank manned. * ""It can be a refueling station for landers."" - It's in a really horrible orbit for landers. Will require about 20% more deltaV every-time. - If you are getting a fueling tanker to fill up the tanks at the station... why not instead have the fueling tanker meet up with the lander directly. * ""We should see what the effects of longtime hard radiation exposure is on humans"" - Didn't know we had Nazi researches from the 1940's here. - The US did allot of experiments on [idiotic] children, pregnant women, Canadian and US cities, etc. We really don't need more unethical research. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rad ... xperiments - We already know what radiation exposure does. - I'm pretty sure there are laws against research like this on Earth. * ""It will be a gateway to Mars"" - It is waaay out of the way for a ship wanting to go to Mars. If I want to go from LA to NY, neither the quickest or cheapest route involves me going to Hawaii. * ""Astronauts can observe the moon"" - Or we could, instead of spending billions, spend $150 million to build and launch a small satellite to orbit the moon with a really, really cheap camera which would still do a better job than the old mark 1 eyeball. * ""We need it to test long term life support"" - ISS - It's planned to be occupied for only 20-30 days at a time. - If you really want to test new systems in space, Earth Orbit is much, much, cheaper. * ""We need it to test long term life support to radiation"" - Radiation only effects computers and humans. - The methods to prevent errors with computers is well known at this point. - It would be cheaper to build it in Low Earth orbit, test it with humans, then without humans raise it up into the van allen radiation belt to see how the systems hold up being bombarded with radiation. * ""It can be a staging point for the orion capsule and a lander"" - Or you could just have the orion (or other capsule) dock directly to the lander. - Not to mention the problem with its orbit means there is only 1 launch window every 2 weeks to leave the moon. That way if there is a problem on the surface that needs a quick escape (Say, the capsule has a air leak), or there is a problem that causes them to miss that date, the astronauts will die.

Now my opinion is that this is going to happen regardless.... but the silver linings are that it could potentially be moved into a less useless orbit and the propulsion unit could be useful for other projects, as it sounds like it might be a decent re-usuable space tug.
It’s all just coincidence... nothing to see here... Keep them fossil fuels a flowin’ boys!... We are gonna ride this flaming hand basket straight to Hell, double time!
What are you implying that the scientist in the article missed?
Major new study came out that concluded sea level rise this century will be atleast twice as bad as previous estimates. No doubt, increased severity and frequency of storms will be linked to warmer oceans as well. Sadly, it seems only the ever mounting social and insurance costs is capable of spurring large scale action.
Replied to the wrong comment you did.

And there it is. The post that will lower my IQ for the rest of the day. Generally speaking, global temps were rising pre WW2 due to lots of growth in industry. CO2 emissions continued to increase after WW2, but we actually experienced some cooling, in part due to particulates in the air from industry and bombing. Now most developed nations scrub emissions. Much less particulates, but all the lovely CO2. So now the air is cleaner (for some values of clean) and more reflective of infrared.
The graph shows there were 7 storms between 2010-2018, making this 2019 storm #8, but the text implies this one is #7. Which is correct?
Yup, from the article: ""a lot of the reason for the heightened activity in the past decade is due to continued improvements in technology to detect storms and provide wind speed data"" Realistically, thats the most important sentence of the article, but that wouldn't make for a good headline.
Yep, I flew around the southern edge of it yesterday going from Puerto Rico to Ft Lauderdale. The storms were building quickly and we had to give it a wide berth. There were strong upper level winds - too much shear for it to get really strong, but impressive nonetheless.
Next step is for the Trump administration to redefine what a hurricane is. How about 150 mph winds and up? Problem solved- no more hurricanes.
My guess is that both are right. The graph is a day or two old, made before the named storm. Probably pulled from an earlier article and not updated for today. Good catch.
Is THIS the new denier rhetoric? The expended energy from WW2 is still taking time to disperse and causing adverse affects today? .... Hahahaha!! That's amazing! Really, it is. Wow...just wow!
It's worth noting that the first specially-instrumented hurricane hunter aircraft, the WB-29, entered service in 1951 with the reactivation of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron. It certainly seems plausible (if far from definitive) that scientists started working with much richer data in 1951 and, being human, got a little over-enthusiastic about interpreting it.
Now, now. Be fair. At least he didn't say climate change is a liberal hoax perpetuated by the Chinese!!!
If that poster is right, we should be expecting Godzilla any time now, due to the nuclear tests in the Pacific decades ago. He's a heavy sleeper.
Best patch ever? Last edited by Voyna i Mor on Tue May 21, 2019 9:47 am
Just don't name it, problem solved...
But will not naming it only change the statistics, or will it cause the storm to wither from embarrassment and disappear?
Mother Nature: hold my beer.
That's the liquor talkin', Randy!

Nice bit of questionable quoting! For those who missed it, here is the full context of the sentence: Quote: In this case, Klotzbach said he thinks a lot of the reason for the heightened activity in the past decade is due to continued improvements in technology to detect storms and provide wind speed data. Note that Anna's selective quoting moved it from being a single scientist positing an opinion to something that appears to be more accepted by the climate community.
It's also an almost uniquely stupid counter-argument, as world energy usage has monotonically increased since then. If WW2 energy consumption caused hurricanes back then, would it not also be causing them now, thus directly proving that anthropogenic climate change is a problem?
In other climate change news, the Canadian oilpatch province of Alberta has elected a pro-fossil fuels conservative government that is insisting the other provinces create a coast-to-coast pipeline corridor to allow them to sell their bitumen to China. Meanwhile, the same province is currently asking the other provinces to send firefighters to help them fight the unseasonably early wildfires that are currently burning the place to ground. Things are feeling like a Simpsons episode at this point.
Quote: This is unprecedented. Next sentence... Quote: ....the development of Andrea breaks the previous record of four consecutive years with a pre-June storm formation. The former record was set from 1951 through 1954, he told Ars. The total of seven pre-June storms this decade, the 2010s, has also tied the number recorded in the 1950s. So there is precedence for consecutive years of early hurricanes. This simply sets a new record.
Can’t help but notice Andrea is a *sub* tropical storm, not a full fledged tropical storm (sustained winds > 45 mph). Naming storms has implications for insurance reimbursement from damages. Storms used to have to be full fledged tropical status to be named.
I thought that was what the 5g spectrum sell off was for! Bad data == no storms!
i can't wait for some weather nerd to show us all why your common sense doesn't compute lol
You're thinking of tropical depressions, which have maximum winds of less than 40 mph. Subtropical storms are so named because they mix the characteristics of tropical and non-tropical systems, not because they are weaker. The difference between the two is also negligible when it comes to the rain and flooding impacts, which are the primary problem with storms of that strength. The latest advisory from the NHC (issued in the last few minutes) now has Andrea as a 35 mph subtropical depression.
It's also snowing like a bastard here in Colorado, because the jet stream is wobbling around like a Hadley cell went ""WOOO TEQUILA SHOTS""
Most of the climate research in recent years have been suggesting that things are worse than we thought. I have this great fear. If we keep doing politics as we have been doing, then, by the time we finally get around to taking actual concrete, binding, enforceable steps to slow the warming (and not just set fluffy goals like the Paris Accord), we would be too late to save ourselves. It's extremely frustrating.
i live in fl. the younger gen under 40 did not vote for stupid laws or awful lets poison are state shit.. but fl mostly made up of 40 and over coward. we are out number here. but we see what happening and are trying to fix it.
Hi there, the subtropics are the areas above and below the tropics.
The ""we've fucked around politically so long that even if we put our heads on straight right this second, came together and knuckled down to solve the problem, it's too late"" point has already passed us
The problem is that climate change is like every other ""future"" problem we face as a society, we do not do anything about until the problem until we slam into that brick wall. The everyone will scream for the Govt to do something NOW!!! The majority of our species has always been that way and it is not going to change any time soon. Fixing our dependency on hydro-carbons would actually be pretty easy to do. We just need to start paying the full cost of using them and the easiest way to do that would be a carbon tax. If people were paying the full cost they would naturally use a lot less. However it would probably double the cost of energy at least in the short term so politically it would take a miracle to put it in action. The only way it would be possible at all is if it was gradually increased over several years but even then it would be a very hard sell.
The protocol is for storms to be named when they have sustained winds of at least 34 knots (39 mph). Your criteria are incorrect.
Andrea has already weakened, perhaps it was prematurely named: https://twitter.com/philklotzbach/statu ... 6395491328

Not hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons though: Quote: Numerous studies leading up to and after AR5 have reported a decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and/or the globally accumulated cyclonic energy (Emanuel, 2005; Elsner et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2010; Holland and Bruyère, 2014; Klotzbach and Landsea, 2015; Walsh et al., 2016). A theoretical physical basis for such a decrease to occur under global warming was recently provided by Kang and Elsner (2015). However, using a relatively short (20 year) and relatively homogeneous remotely sensed record, Klotzbach (2006) reported no significant trends in global cyclonic activity, consistent with more recent findings of Holland and Bruyère (2014). Such contradictions, in combination with the fact that the almost four decade-long period of remotely sensed observations remains relatively short to distinguish anthropogenically induced trends from decadal and multi-decadal variability, implies that there is only low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global warming over the last four decades.

No way that happens by 2024. NASA original plan before it was sped up was in 2024 there is an uncrewed test of the descent element only. This allows more time for transfer and ascent elements to be completed. Then in 2026 there would be an uncrewed test of tug, descent stage, and ascent stage. Then in 2028 propellent transfer vehicle is added to refuel the reusable ascent & transfer element for a crewed landing. It is still a hacky way to include SLS, Orion, and Gateway in a lunar landing but it is at least plausible and provides a step by step increase in capabilities. The new timeline (does anyone at NASA actually believe it) means the first time the descent, ascent, and transfer vehicles are used will be in a crewed landing on the moon. Also it looks like the first one in 2024 will be 100% expendable. Note new transfer, ascent, and descent lander in 2025 before going to refueling in 2026+. The only good things I see is an acceptance by NASA that distributed launch and refueling (eventually) are necessary for sustainability. The SLS is still used but it is no longer the ""one rocket to rule them all"". If you can do 70% of the mission without the SLS you could do 100% of the mission without the SLS. It provides a way to phase the SLS out without a loss of capabilities.
Well, you can't set in stone scope, time frame and cost simultaneously. Basic rule of project management
It doesn't matter who ends up in the Oval Office after 2020. If a dem wins, they will likely not be ready to support a program that is now linked with Trump. If Trump is re-elected, he's not going to go to the mat for the funding necessary to make a 2024 landing possible. It's a re-election ploy, pure and simple, and once 2020 is over, he will drop it and head on to the next shiny object.
Is there a larger copy of the plan graphic anywhere? The one in the article has a lot of text too small/too JPEGed to be readable.
I'd like to introduce you to the new project director......
The current administration has no intention of seeing this through. Tying it to Pell grant money dooms it, as it should. If they were sincere, there would be tax increases or huge amounts of money taken from the defense budget. Since they currently are ginning up another war to line their pockets with, that seems highly unlikely.
The crewed launch for SLS on only its 2nd outing still strikes me as questionable. I know much bigger risks have been taken in the past, but we should be past that level of risk taking now. Adding urgency to work towards an artificial and recently imposed deadline on top of that? That scares me.
""Predecisional - For internal use only.""
China's moon base will roll out the red carpet for the Yankee's eventual arrival.
Barring Starship being a reality, this is probably NASA's last chance to beat China. If we got there in 2026 we'd be there a full four or five years before them.
The only real question for the program's survival is, assuming Trump is reelected in 2020; will it be far enough along in 2024 to survive the next administration. The original by 2028 plan Statistical references above is IMO still rather iffy. A single robotic test flight with the first crewed mission 4 years out is preliminary enough to be a reasonable target for a housecleaning cut. Flags at footsteps by 2024 is almost certainly not going to happen, but how far long would the program need to have reasonable chance of survival?
I saw that. I was asking if what you were using was the only leaked copy or if a higher res one was out; with the one in the article having been resized because reasons.
Nothing is more overhyped than Chinese HSF capabilities.
I think that SpaceX will beat the SLS and Boeing back to the Moon. The SLS seems more like a make work project for Alabama and is plagued with delays. There isn't the political will to go back to the Moon with consistent funding from Congress. Is there some reason, other than a Trump administration vanity project, to get people back to the Moon ASAP? Wouldn't it make more sense to fund private efforts to develop these sorts of launch capabilities in order to reduce the costs of going deeper and deeper into space? Is SpaceX working on a lunar lander or just planning to orbit at this time?
I agree that the Pell Grant funding idea was a poison pill, and Trump knew it. He doesn't really want to spend money on a Moon landing, and when dems kill his extra funding for NASA, he can go out on the campaign trail and say that dems are holding America back from doing great things, along with his steady trope of lies, that dems want open borders, want crime, want to execute babies after they are born..... The man is a dim bulb, but there are some people around him who actually know how government runs. I wouldn't be surprised if Mulvaney was the one who suggested the Pell Grant strategy. Trump likely doesn't even know what a Pell Grant is, but Mulvaney, as an original Tea Partier, absolutely does, and it goes along with their philosophy of cutting social programs.
I'm curious how reasonable the suggestion of Nuclear surface power by 2025 is. I'm assuming that would be a RTG, but other than the Martian and use in probes, I've not really heard much about them. Is it feasible that something providing significant levels of power could be ready by then?
Hmm... I think I see the real plan here. 1. Assign YUGE Moon budget to NASA in 2019. 2. Get re-elected in 2020 off the back of it. 3. Announce cost has spiralled, so project cancelled. 4. Claw back billions from NASA & plow it into ""Project Tequila Curtain"" (the wall).
It would be easier to fold a saltine. SMH.
""Artemis?"" they'll need to watch out for three strange people in black clothing.
NASA has an experimental prototype reactor design called kilopower. So far it has been designed, built, and tested on a token amount of funding. I think it is possible but it would need a serious ramp up in funding and resources to go from experimental to mission ready in 6 years. Personally I don't think we will have a crewed landing before 2026 (more likely 2028).
They'll only be 23 years late in finding the monolith on the moon. At this rate, the Star Child may never be born.
It's unclear to me about the lack of an ascent module RFP so far. NASA selected 11 companies to work on descent modules and transfer vehicles, but did they not ask for anyone to work on an ascent module proposal, or did no one want to work on that?
This is so not happening, this is just a mock up so that Trump can say ""look, this is my plan"" but the price will be such that the US wont be willing or able to do it.
My understanding is that unlike the other elements NASA wants to run the ascent module themselves as a cost-plus contract. The rest will be firm fixed price contracts like Commercial Resupply and Commercial Crew. That essentially sets up the ascent module to be an Orion 2.0 with $20B pricetag and decade long development.
Some people on this forum's faith in SpaceX's capability to delivery one of the largest, most flexible rockets ever designed incorporating some radically new design concepts? To be clear, I want to believe. In fact I'm fairly certain that baring financial events it will happen. Just not quickly.
And hard to believe that Apollo took all of one launch and three days to get people to the lunar surface three times a year. With an architecture that starts out with two vehicles docked in LEO for a total of 120t.
The talk of not having international partners was interesting. I am sure that ESA and JAXA would be willing to be part of any lunar plan. And when Russia said that NASA had asked them to modify Soyuz for a lunar configuration, were they lying, (probably)?
I've uploaded a higher-resolution copy of the plan to the story.
Quote: ""My understanding is that unlike the other elements NASA wants to run the ascent module themselves as a cost-plus contract.

Unless he and his mates have already purchased substantial shares in the companies that will be awarded the contracts for this stuff. Pork. Pork, pork, pork, Pork!
There's a better chance of alien life finding us and then giving us a ride to the Moon than there is of any of this happening. It's all just masturbation that was originally demanded in order to distract from more Earthly problems.
Kilopower has been quietly coming along, and it's one element that I'd bet on if it was funded up. Nice simple idea. There'll be an interesting metric balancing the mass of solar + lunar night batteries, vs solar + load batteries + kilopower night nuke (s). Nice of NASA to prove it out before loading a dozen on each Mars-bound starship (let me dream).
Yeah, somehow I'm back onboard with all this. No 'one great leap', this is the lunar proving ground for all the Mars tech that we'll need. ISRU, long duration spaceflight, etc. That and I like the heavy reliance on multiple commercial crew launchers. Especially if the ascent stage (and last vestiges of orion) really are just notional bones thrown to the traditional contractors.
37 Falcon Heavy launches (expended center core, 50+ t to LEO) is only 15 months of SLS + Exploration Ground Systems spending. I think NASA could afford 300+ FH launches by 2029 if they could use SLS and EGS funds for that. Rather than SLS, it would be simpler to build lots of hypergolic transfer stages, launch them on FH and other commercial rockets, and use them to push Orion and the lander ascent stage to various orbits.

Thanks both. Always amazed quite how well informed so many of the commentators are here (myself excluded...). Eric: if you're still about and open to ideas, a wider article about the current state of human space exploration would be very interesting. Where are we up to with ISRU, RTGs, (automated) construction of habitats, etc...
I see .. lobbyists found a new thing to play with.
Worse, once they get their hands on the Pell Grant reserve fund it will be used for some other program--maybe wall building--money is quite fungible and this administration has demonstrated some remarkable creativity when it comes to robbing social funds.
If the SpaceX Starship is built to land on the Earth or Mars it can land on the Moon.
Only trump could manage to poison space exploration enthusiasm among young people by proposing to fund it by cuts to the Pell grant program.
I wonder if Boeing is going to brush off its Constellation-era Altair design from 10+ years ago and resubmit it.
$45 million for some pretty blue-prints...and they'll still be no closer to going back. Meanwhile, just yesterday Trump admin cancelled $900 million funding for California's fast rail project...a project that's doubled in price to somewhere around $80 billion, with countless billions already sunk into it over the past decade - nothing built. Face the facts, the US is incapable of mega-projects.
Sooey! Oink, oink, oink. Pork on the hoof. By the time it is all said and done tens of billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of engineer years will have been wasted on an obsolete expendable rocket too expensive and unreliable to use and a useless heavy under powered spacecraft.
Being psychic, I predict that the Senate will pass a version with the requested funding and that in reconciliation, most of the $1.6 billion will survive as will the increased funding for the SLS. I further predict that the program will run into ""unforeseen delays"" that cause it to happen no earlier than 2030, just as the original plan had it.
The Artemis requirements are much smaller. Altair was a monster of a lander. It was more like lander and transport vehicle in one. Unlike more conventional designs the lander not the service module on the Orion did a good portion of the departure burn and lunar orbit insertion burn. It is why Orion is so worthless today (lunar command module which can't reach the moon). It never made sense without Altair. Last edited by Statistical on Fri May 17, 2019 8:54 am
If anything, just for the name it would be amazing. Although, as mentioned, it is gigantic and too large in scope compared to what NASA is currently looking for.
I don't know that its money ""wasted""... I think of the federal government as a heat pump, moving money from taxpayers to corporations, ESPECIALLY corporations that happen to have a senator or congressman on an appropriations committee...
Yeah, without at least $1B/yr for the lander systems, the whole schedule is even more blown than it was before.
What is the mission goals? Maybe I missed it, but so far I haven't come across what the point of the mission is. The Apollo missions made sense in the ""Space race"" and gather scientific data realm, but we have landers that we currently use for scientific information about the moon. As much as I love space and space exploration I am not sure putting people back on the moon just for the sake of doing it is wise with the budget and deficits as they are right now.
That Artist's Conception looks like something I put together in KSP.
So... maybe? /s
The goals are political aggrandizement for the white house and financial pork to the states of powerfully placed law makers.
Based on what the money was awarded for, it seems that BO and LockMart would be the frontrunners out of the gate. BO has done 3 years worth of design work for Blue Moon, and LockMart has its lander concept. That being said, I just don't see any of this happening for the 2024 timeline. It was always highly ambitious, and with the House budget tossing more billions into SLS and Orion than was requested by NASA and the White House, it is apparent that pork will once again dominate over actually getting something done. The fact that they also cut money for a lander and Gateway also shows that Congress is not behind the accelerated schedule. If anything, that may be a reflection that some realize that there may be better options than Gateway, and if so, funding a lander that depends on that architecture may be premature. So Shelby gets his pork, but is also being given a nudge to tell him that the architecture that allows SLS and Orion to actually go to the Moon isn't worth funding yet, as they don't believe SLS or Orion is going to be flying anytime soon, if ever. They'll give SLS a bit more money to build a noose of dollar bills, and if it still can't get off the ground, they will hang it with those bills and look elsewhere, such as SpaceX and BO to get the job done. Carrot and Stick 101.
I'm going to repost some commentary I made when these awards came up in the SpaceX Starlink scrub thread, since it's actually on topic here! I find it intriguing how different the awards are for the different companies.   Particular points of interest to me: * Wildly varying numbers of prototypes from different companies. Five prototypes from Dynetics for the same element! * 17 descent element prototypes in total, 3 transfer element prototypes, 5 refuelling element prototypes * No ascent element work at all * SpaceX isn't going to be building any hardware under these awards * OrbitBeyond (who I've never heard of before) got awards to build two refuelling element prototypes without doing any studies, and Masten Space Systems got an award for a descent element prototype with no study Last edited by Hydrargyrum on Fri May 17, 2019 9:12 am
Lockmarts lander concept doesn't meet the requirements. NASA isn't allowing a free for all. All designs for the artemis program must meet size, mass, and payload requirements. Right now these awards are just for detailed studies and in some cases prototypes of critical components. All these companies submitted proposals, NASA took the ones they liked and said here is some cash to do detailed design work complete it by this date. Based on those detailed design proposals NASA will likely have a second phase and maybe a third phase eventually narrowing it down to one descent element, one transfer vehicle element, and one refueling element. Ascent element is likely going to be a pork-plus monster (Orion 2.0). At least that is the plan in theory, it could all just get scrapped tomorrow. I do agree the 2024 is never going to happen but I also think if NASA planned for 2028 then it wouldn't happen before 2038. Plan for 2024 maybe they actually put someone on the moon in 2028.

I have a suspicion you are dead on the money with that conclusion. If we had a good reason, even just prepping to or determining if harvesting H3 is a worthwhile goal I could be behind this.

Otherwise China will own the entire Moon?
Another issue is have we solved the problem of heavy lifting it all into a trans-orbit? The Falcon heavy can lift alot into LEO, but last I checked still lacks the ability to get it into an orbit high enough to allow for transition to the moon.
OK whats the cargo? How much will it weigh? People and/or gear? Does it need to come back? It makes little sense to build a manned lander first. The first return vehicle should be a robot(s) which can built test structures with sensors to see which concept makes the most sense.
Could you expand on that? Not doubting your conclusions, I am behind on the current understanding of H3, it was my understanding that we could use it for fusion if we can get the temperature problems sorted out.
What is ""it"" in it-all? One of the reason (not a good one but the reason) for splitting this into ascent stage, descent stage, transfer vehicle, and separate refueling vehicle is that all of them could be sent to NRHO using existing (and future planned) heavy lift vehicles. None of the elements are more than 8t liftoff mass. Falcon Heavy could send all of them on a TLI. If by ""it"" you mean the boat anchor Orion? Yeah it is going to be launched on the SLS or we won't be using it. I don't see any of the franken-rocket ways to get Orion to NRHO happening. Last edited by Statistical on Fri May 17, 2019 9:24 am

In other words, the strategy I used to use with my ex. If we had to be somewhere at 6, I told her 5, and with luck, we'd make the 6 appointment.
Ok, like I said I haven't kept up on current technology. I was wondering how they were going to deal with the weight issues, guess using modules would keep the weight low enough to allow for transfer orbits. I wonder if this will increase the possibilities for mechanical failures though.
As far as I can tell, it's Congress that can't really decide if it wants to go back to the Moon and beyond. As long as Congress dictates how much (that's their job of course) and HOW NASA can spend the money (Congress is terrible at micro-managing agencies) this dithering back and forth and aimlessly not really going anywhere will continue. Republicans generally are fine with it as long as the contracts are spread to their districts and companies they support. Democrats are fine with funding AS LONG as it does not take money away from any social program they deem more important (which really...is all of them). My prediction is that a private space entity (SpaceX, etc) will make it to Mars first. Maybe even the moon. Equally possible is China depending on if it's important to them to beat everybody else.
It seems the House budget isn't sold on this plan, no matter what the timeline is. They cut some funding for Gateway as well as a lander. To me, this is a sign that they certainly don't believe in 2024, and if so, they are going to wait to spend the money to see what better options than SLS/Orion/Gateway emerge in that time. Why spend money when the rocket to get to the Moon via the Gateway, and the lander system to actually land, isn't anywhere close to flying? It may be actually one of the smarter decisions they have made in the funding process. Of course, paying tribute to the Troll of Alabama must continue, so more money for SLS and Orion. If the extra funding doesn't speed up their construction, they will use it as an excuse to end the program.
Give something to SLS and Orion to do and pretend the money spent on them wasn't an 11 figure dumpster fire.
Statistical wrote:  Another issue is have we solved the problem of heavy lifting it all into a trans-orbit? The Falcon heavy can lift alot into LEO, but last I checked still lacks the ability to get it into an orbit high enough to allow for transition to the moon. What is ""it"" in it-all. One of the reason (not a good one but the reason) for splitting this into ascent stage, descent stage, transfer vehicle, and seperate refueling vehicle is that all of them could be sent to NRHO using existing (and future planned) heavy lift vehicles. None of the elements mass more than 8t gross. Ok, like I said I haven't kept up on current technology. I was wondering how they were going to deal with the weight issues, guess using modules would keep the weight low enough to allow for transfer orbits. I wonder if this will increase the possibilities for mechanical failures though. Well they still are heavy (42t total for one sortie) and don't require any exotic technology it is just splitting them into smaller chunks. Don't get me wrong I am not enthusiastic about it. It is a really ""hacky"" way to keep Orion, gateway, and SLS in the loop but launch vehicles should not be an issue. Hopefully somewhere down the line Orion and gateway are axed and a space taxi plus tug are used instead. One can dream right?
Why would you need a return vehicle for robots? Is there some robot civil rights act which prohibits abandoning robots on the moon. The descent stage (which lowers the ascent stage to the moon) can also be used without the ascent stage to land bulk cargo on the moon. In fact I would be surprised if it wasn't tested first by doing exactly that.
He3. You can make all the tritium you want easily on earth.
Next to all these private companies achieving space goals in a way NASA hasn't been able to consistently do for the entire span of my life makes all their future efforts, plans, and self imposed deadlines feel like the grandiose ambitions of an old friend who can't seem to succeed at anything they set out to do; a little sad, a little pathetic.
The OST prohibits emplacing weapons on the moon. Weapons on the moon as a strategic option make little sense to begin with but they are prohibited regardless. There is no hard limit on radio telescopes in space. The current largest (NRO sat) is due to the limit of what could be launched with one heavy launch vehicle. If you were to use one launch vehicle the radio telescope you could put on the moon would be smaller and further away. Exploration is the reason to go to the moon.
Space programs exist for 4 reasons: 1. Science 2. Prestige 3. Exploitation 4. Military While we like to think that NASA and other national programs are focused on science, like the Federation in Star Trek, let's not forget that prestige, especially with regards to HSF, was probably the dominant factor, if not the only factor in the Apollo program and its predecessors. The military also obviously has a big role in space, with spy satellites, communication satellites and monitoring satellites, such as those meant to detect nuclear explosions and rocket launches. Exploitation, primarily resource mining, is the only one of those items that isn't being addressed right now, but I think that will become the primary driver over the next few decades. We may go back to the Moon in the next few years, driven by the prestige and science motives, but we will stay for the exploitation after that.
I am pretty sure that placing a weapons platform on the moon would violate some treaties and would likely immediately spark off a war, plus the other problems are you are at the mercy of orbital mechanics and can not change the orbit of the moon on demand. The other issue is likely distance, I think many don't understand how crazy far away the moon is Last edited by Raistian77 on Fri May 17, 2019 10:18 am
My guess: 1) The last decades of jumping between expensive, later canceled projects, without any clear goals. - Financial pork to the states from congress. 2) Getting people to actually land on the moon - A slowly accelerated race to secure future claims in space 3) Sending small sonds and landers - Here might actually be some scientific interests involved
I think its safe to say that Masten's entire history has been a study of lunar (and other) landers. Given their track record working with NASA, I'm guessing the space agency is comfortable with Masten going straight to prototype.
So what exactly would happen if NASA decided to spend it's money differently than the congressional budget dictated?
So what you're saying is that if we did resurrect Altair, then the whole need for a gateway and transfer vehicle goes away, right? The architecture suddenly becomes a lot less complicated. So why aren't we doing that? Rhetorical question, don't bother answering.
I get the dual use, but using it to recover engines is plainly madness when there's another, demonstrably successful way to recover the engines. And a way that a rival, using the same engine, is planning on using.
ULA engineers still suffer from what Henry Spencer, sci.space Usenet Newsgroups, calls ""performance uber alles"". That engineering philosophy came from missiles which later became launch vehicles. They're just now trying to work on lowering costs, but I'm not seeing much success there based on what's being reported in the press.
And a way that saves the entire first stage, rather than just part of it.
Lowering costs involves a completely different paradigm of thinking in design.
Can someone explain *inflatable* heat shield? Seems like any membrane that is inflated would melt or pop at re-entry speeds and temperature..
I completely agree and that was Henry's point. It was also a deliberate choice of his to throw a little German in the phrase as well. Since both the US and U.S.S.R. relied on former German V-2 engineers to kick off their space programs, it should come as no surprise that those same engineers designed nothing but fully expendable launch vehicles that tended to optimize on performance criteria other than cost. Dry mass ratios, ISP, and etc. were extremely important to them and improving those criteria quite often negatively impacted cost. Unfortunately, this sent us down a path of expendable launch vehicles for several generations, ultimately delaying the advent of affordable, reusable, launch vehicles.
The inflatable part is usually behind a flexible but thick plastic, that gassifies under the heat and pressures of re-entry, and acts just like any other ablative heat shield.
Making a lot of Starship vehicles makes sense, even without the special versions and picky customers, they will take a while to integrate with the payload, early on there will be a lot of post flight inspection, and they are going to need to be able to iterate quickly...
While I recognize that a lighter/stronger composite upper stage has major advantages in kilos to orbit, using ""advanced"", more expensive tech seems to be a step in the wrong direction when (admittedly for different reasons) Space-X has moved to inexpensive Inox for Starship.
Starship being so big also gives it a lot of ""thow mass at the problem"" margin and the steel is part of the tps
NASA is interested in the test? Are they funding some or all of it? The parents of ULA aren't exactly known to be willing to let ULA spend a dime on unsponsored R&D that can be avoided.
It seems to be working out fine for Electron and even the super-cost-focused Vector. It's a different set of manufacturing techniques but I'm not sure overall there's actually that much more expense per unit.
I am not so sure that *any* mass is being thrown at the problem. SpaceX apparently came to the conclusion that at the system level composite + TPS was heavier than stainless steel + active cooling where needed. The massively thick icing on the cake is stain steel construction is cheaper in several different ways and can be done in a field.
I recall reading elsewhere that it's a no-money-exchanged deal: NASA gets to fly this new prototype heat shield that they've developed for free (not paying launch costs), but ULA gets to see all the design specs and results of the experiment, so they can use that to build their own inflatable heat shields later.
The House released their version of the 202 NASA budget: Exploration gets $5.13 billion, including 1.43 for Orion and 2.15 for SLS, which is supposed to include EUS and be capable of 130 metric tonnes to LEO (heh). Exploration R&D got $962M. No money for a lander. They did fund most of the things the Administration wanted to cut, including STEM. https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/ ... 0Draft.pdf
The ""throw mass at it"" is simply using a thicker gauge of steel in initial prototypes. It's easier to make a steel ship heavy now and optimize for mass on later versions, compared to an integrated composite airframe.
That is par for the course. The second block Apollo SM had thinner and lighter propellant tanks than the first after NASA had flight experience which let them record actual temperature and pressure variations experienced versus the conservative estimates that drove initial design margins.
Starting to get annoyed with everyone referring to the Starship manufacture as A/B testing. It's not. Musk said they will be built at both locations and will share data and insights to improve each other's performance and processes.
That's ridiculous, every single space fairing nation has invested heavily into reusable space planes / rockets. The number of programs here including R&D and prototypes is absurd, but I'll list a few: Space Shuttle, X15, X20, X30, X33, X37, Buran Shuttle, SpaceShipOne/Two, DreamChaser, MUSTARD, HOTOL, Hermes, HOPE, MBB 1 / Sanger 2... Hundreds of billions have been invested into these programs. SpaceX's successful (economical) reuse relies on many advances that SpaceX took advantage of. Right company, right time.

In the 50's and 60's that was the only way to get to orbit and beyond. Engines, structures, and GNC systems were heavy and unreliable and things got to space on luck as much as thrust and propellant. The failure was later - a loss of nerve and imagination IMO largely caused by the utter failure of STS's partial re-usability to improve the launch cadence and lower the cost of spaceflight. Expendables were at least an order of magnitude better. Advances in the 80s like DC-X showed the way but NASA suffered tunnel vision locked on hydrolox, SSTO/near-SSTO architectures, and horizontal landing. Even today much of old space is still in denial and living and acting like nothing has changed.

Most of those are not launch vehicles. His point was on expendable vs reusable launch vehicles. The STS (space shuttle) is arguably the only serious attempt a partially reusable launch vehicle. A really bad attempt doomed before they even began bending metal but an attempt.
Yeah moving into hydrolox and sustainer engine (as a precursor to SSTO) was clearly a dead end path. Imagine if instead they had started with figuring out how to land the first stage of a Saturn V. A two stage saturn V where first stage is reusable along with improvements in mass fractions and engine upgrades could have radically changed the cost of spaceflight. Hydrolox SSTO is all or nothing and in the end we got nothing.
I take exception to mentioning those two companies in the same sentence as examples of success. Rocket Lab is putting stuff into space while Vector seems more interested in indulging the car racing fetish of its founder. https://twitter.com/jamesncantrell/stat ... 6909826048
It's surprising how little urgency ULA has. This initial test will be 6 years after the first F9 booster landing, likely meaning it'll be at least another 4-6 years (since it's ULA) before it's ready to be tested on a stage. By 2021, Starship and New Glenn will be flying or at least be close to. But by 2027, at the least, SpaceX will have demonstrated orbital refueling and Starship landing and reuse, and Blue won't be far behind. The inflatable heat shield is a fine idea for payloads but not for rockets. the time and money would be better spent trying to woo engineers experienced with reuse away from SpaceX. Last edited by buback on Fri May 17, 2019 10:25 am
With two ~500Klbs thrust engines, there's no way Vulcan is doing a retropropulsive landing. SpaceX can do that because they started with 9 relatively small engines of their own design, so they can land on just the center engine and maintain a reasonable thrust to weight ratio. ULA doesn't make their own engines, so they work with what they got.
It would be interesting to see how much extra ULA would have to pay to convince smart engineers to work where innovation goes to die.
Not with its main engines. But (fortunately?), Vulcan's build a rocket heritage means that it will have 6 sets of hard points around the perimeter; 3 of which could be used to mount small landing engines around the perimeter of the booster. I'm sure it won't cost more than a few billion dollars to a suitably sized methalox engine and to route plumbing from the existing internal tanks to the strapon landing engines. /mostly s, but no more crazy than their official recovery plan
Most of those, except for the space shuttle, are not launch vehicles. Buran is arguably a payload since it has no main engines of its own. Some of those certainly did aspire to become launch vehicles (e.g. HOTOL) but did so through a misguided, IMHO, devotion to wings and wheels on a runway that would somehow result in reduced launch costs even though the increase in overall complexity is considerable. I believe that Henry Spencer also said something along the lines of, ""There is nothing magic about wheels on a runway that reduces launch costs"".
Maybe they could buy some TQ-12 engines from Landspace (80t methalox). Move the pair of BE-4 engines closer to the edges and put a single TQ-12 in the center. I am kidding about using a Chinese engine to replace a Russian engine but I do think a design using different engine sizes could work. Obviously the cluster of lots of smaller engines is more flexible but it doesn't have to be the only option. https://spacenews.com/landspace-assembl ... greements/ Last edited by Statistical on Fri May 17, 2019 10:50 am
Could be done with a extra-sporty hoverslam (~6 g instead of Falcon's ~1.5). Or a pair of landing engines, e.g. RL-10 converted to methane. Have to redesign the whole engine section to add SMART anyway, so it's not really much more work, and they can help on the the way up.
ESA's Prometheus would be ideal. Cheap, restartable, reuseable, throttable. Use two or more non-separating LRBs with the landing engines helping on ascent, and they don't even need to take a performance hit or break into the plumbing at all.
It took SpaceX a lot of landing blooper reel installments to understand Merlin throttling and vectoring dynamics well enough to achieve hover slam at 1.5g. I am not sure Vulcan will fly enough over its lifetime to get 6 g landing working at all let alone with enough flights remaining to pay back the effort expended.
Starship's size is a big part of what makes it's approach to EDL viable. It makes heavy use of its ability to simply dump heat into all that steel and bleed it off over time after the initial aerobraking maneuver. Due to the square-cube law dictating that any scaled-down version of Starship's heat mitigation system will have a much lower mass-of-steel:cross-sectional-area ratio than Starship itself, and that it seems Starship's EDL strategy is really only thermally viable at its current design scale or larger, this EDL approach wouldn't really be viable for anything significantly smaller than Starship itself. Plus, the heatsinking/evaporative-cooling approach has yet to be proven, or even tested, for that matter, in flight-ready hardware. That's not to say I don't support Elon's EDL strategy for Starship; I wholeheartedly do. I think it's brilliant, in fact. It's just that I think it might be a little premature to start banking on what is, as yet, an unproven approach to the problem for other, unrelated vehicles.
well Starship's size only really makes sense because it's supposed to be fully reusable, the physics and general operational concept behind the approach is actually very similar to what you see in an ablative heat shield.
Actually, the second F9 recovery test on the CRS-3 mission succeeded at landing softly. The hoverslam itself doesn't seem to have made landing much more difficult or directly caused any failures. ULA seems to think that Vulcan will be flying for a while, but their parents are highly unlikely to invest any money in recovery IMO, so it doesn't really matter.
Wow, that's a far more pragmatic arrangement than I expected from either of them.
You need to dissipate a fixed amount of kinetic energy, about 30 MJ/kg, for re-entry. By increasing surface area with an inflatable, you lower the energy per square meter. Therefore you lower peak heating rate and temperature. There are high-temperature ceramics, like silicon carbide cloth, that can retain strength to ~1400 C. It is also pretty strong.

As a charter member of the first church of cheese I bid you cheese-speed.
Interesting SpaceX bid for descent element but not refueling element. Between either FH or Starship (if ready) it would seem that a refueling element mission would be a good match for their capabilities.
anybody knows what are the launch wind speed limits for each layer of the atmosphere?
Yeah, any 'home sapien' who 'gorks life' counts as special all right.
It's all for show anyway. NASA is insisting that the Gateway is an integral part of the plan along with SLS. 2024? Nope.
There is a difference between Gork and Grok....
Regarding the choice of Hall effect propellants: http://www.iepc2013.org/get?id=074 If I'm reading the charts correctly, it looks like krypton gets you 80% of the thrust for 25% of the propellant cost versus xenon. Argon is cheaper still (1% of the cost) but the performance penalty is steep (roughly 40% of the thrust). Neon is perhaps between krypton and argon, but it doesn't look like there's data to support that speculation.
I think that depends on how heavy the rocket/payload is. But don't quote me on that.
I'm still trying to figure out what a home-sapian is. Is this it?
Yeah, I know you were hoping that SpaceX would play a role in refueling, but as I anticipated, it doesn't seem like that's going to happen. I think they'll do a paper study on a hypergolic descent stage loosely based on Dragon technology, and that will be the end of it. Falcon Heavy will probably be involved in launching payloads for Artemis, but those payloads will not be produced by SpaceX. Starship doesn't fit what NASA wants to do, and Artemis is a distraction from what SpaceX wants to do. I believe there's a great future ahead for NASA and SpaceX to work together on human exploration, but until Starship is proven, they'll have to agree to disagree in the short term in the interest of maintaining what is obviously a crucial relationship in the long term.
Godspeed SpaceX and Starlink.
A worldwide network in the sky. There should be a name for that.
SpaceX has a similar system where they contracted out their Mars architecture: Steve the welder does the body and then Dave the plumber puts in the engine.
In UTC that is Friday, actually.
The launch simulations are even more dramatic than I imagined. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgjS_xQWXM
Damn. I going to miss this and I don't want get spoiled. I'm going to leave Youtube open in a window and close everything else, so when I get back tonight I can watch from the beginning.
Why would neon be between krypton and argon? Being less heavy than argon, I'd expect it to perform worse than argon - or I'm missing something important here?
Just how fast is that?
The youtube part is watchable any time. You don't need to keep it open. Its best to watch later anyway, you can skip the boring parts like everything before T-10 and the videoless parts of the orbital maneuvers.
It's pretty fast. Take some cheese and make it bubble on a plate in the microwave. Now start spinning the plate to add an amount of rotational inertia. You will see the speed of cheese as it starts to accelerate away from the center. ""It will almost seem like spreading a blob of cheese on a pizza.""
From what little I understand, the equation involves density and electron shell. But I don’t understand enough to go any further.
Can you include a cut grape into the center to speed up the process with plasma jets?
Here we go again!
Where's that hilarious image of a Starship docked to ISS and/or Gateway...

Here's an idea, if you wait 7 years for your first post, PROOFREAD. Jeez man.
Scrub? I haven’t seen a reason why but SpaceFlightNow is reporting it and that the countdown clocks are stopped.
Naaaah man, it’s all a conspiracy theory. Musk was forced to use krypton after Starman accidentally broke Zod out of the Phantom Zone again. It’s Trump’s Space Wall to keep the Kryptonians out.
Scrubbed again, likely due to persisting upper level winds. https://twitter.com/gpallone13/status/1 ... 5775533062
60*227kg = 13620 kg There appears to be 5 tons unaccounted for? Unless there's 83kg of structure between each satellite? Seems like a lot. Jebediah, how many snacks did you say you brought?
Could it be a next frontier to make launches ""weather-resistant""? Or is it just not worth it? I'd imagine if there is many more launches in the future, scrubbing all the time would become a problem.
F9 is a very fine rocket (ratio of height to width). A less fine rocket should have higher wind sheer tolerances.
That's awards received, not necessary awards bid. Assuming they bid, they likely would have done so for methalox equipment, which they are interested in, but NASA isn't interested in.
I'm not a terribly big Musk fan, but I am amused by publicly admitting that all human endeavour carries with it the potential for humiliating defeat.
Now THAT is a satellite bus to write home about. The spin-deal technique seems ... unique. Why isn't this an RTLS launch? Is there still junk at LS-1? Edit: Oh wait never mind. She be HEAVY. Last edited by Peevester on Wed May 15, 2019 7:36 pm
This is utter insanity. No one expected 60 satellites in one launch. That's straight up nuts.
The payload is so heavy that they need all the fuel they can muster to get to orbit. There's not enough fuel for RTLS
Musk continues his infuriating trend of rapidly fluctuating between the coolest rich guy and a total weirdo.
Dang, that strikes me as a rather clever solution.
SpaceX Musk is awesome. Tesla Musk is a complete idiot. I wish he would step down as Tesla's CEO.
The insanity is it's not the record - India's PSLV program did more than a hundred in one launch a couple years ago. Admittedly they were mostly tiny (not even 1U cubesat size), and the total mass launched was a tiny fraction of this one, but still, credit where it's due.
That totally sounds like the result of a brainstorming session where folks were competing to come up with the craziest ideas. Awesome.
Kinda. Krypton offers higher specific impulse (isp) which is generally what is thought of as performance. The penalty is it offers less thrust and hall effect thrusters are barely putting out the tiniest of thrust even with xenon. That is what makes the switch to krypton unusual they will lose about 20% thrust. It is however a very SpaceXey move. The cheaper your sat becomes the more import propellant costs become. $10K vs $50K in propellant for a $200M bird who cares. $10K vs $50K starts to be real money when you are building sats for less than $1M and plan on building 12,000 of them.
So with re-use, let's say the launch cost (to SpX) is about 50% of $62 M ~ $30 M. 60 satellites, $0.5 M each to launch. Assume they cost that much to build.. $1 M per satellite. Starlink phase 1 = 1600 satellites. So a $1.6 B investment for a ""global"" high-speed internet infrastructure in space. That's insanely cheap. The ROI on this (if it works), could be massive. If this launch and test phase goes well, I'd expect another capital raising for SpX, at a significant premium to their last issue. I don't know how anyone else can compete.

At 18.5 metric tons, this launch is just 1.5 tons short of the threshold to qualify the Falcon 9 as a ""heavy-lift launch vehicle."" And it sounds like this is an ASDS booster landing, meaning they aren't using 100% of the capability of the Falcon 9. So if there were any doubts that the Falcon 9 has the potential to be a heavy-lifter, that should be alleviated.
One thing Musk said in the phone conference is the constellation will not initially have intersat links. Service will only be available within range of a ground station. They plan to add the intersat links later. Not sure if later means later phases of the network or later as in 5 years from now then these sats start to get replaced with next gen ones. It seems a smart move to me. Optical high speed intersat links is a lot of complexity. It is really cool stuff and opens up a lot of capabilities but it always seemed to me to go against SpaceX's strategy of getting ""minimum viable product"" to market and then iterating.
Where did you get 18.5t from? I assume that is metric? Other sites are reported a lot less. The sats are 227kg ea. So 60 of them would be 13,620 kg. Even without a dispenser there is likely some overhead but >5t overhead? Last edited by Statistical on Wed May 15, 2019 8:00 pm

I got it from Eric's article: Quote: If the weather and Falcon 9 rocket cooperate, the first batch of SpaceX's Internet satellites will launch from Florida on Wednesday evening. With a mass of 18.5 tons, this will be the company's heaviest launch to date for either the Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy rocket. I suppose I was assuming that Eric was talking metric, not imperial, tons, and perhaps that was a mistake.
Did something get garbled along the way? Because 'different amount of rotational inertia' doesn't make much sense. The spin rate of the rocket shouldn't change as each satellite is released. The released satellite carries away some angular momentum from the remaining assembly, but the moment of inertia of the assembly is likewise decreased, and it's the spin rate which sets the angular momentum of each released satellite. Are they deliberately spinning up the assembly during the dispersal? Last edited by dmsilev on Wed May 15, 2019 8:04 pm
Yeah I was asking Eric.
It does also suggest that there is a structure holding the satellites onto the payload adaptor. Some earlier speculation was that the satellites were attached to each other only - but if they're spinning it, I guess there's a very simple release mechanism (no pushers etc.) That might account for the extra 5 tonnes of mass... (?)
It's funny how often Elon downplays SpaceX' probability of succeeding. ""I give Falcon heavy a 50% chance of success"", etc. Compare this to how often he oversells Tesla. ""2 years until full self driving capability"" - Elon Musk 2014. To an outsider it seems like the folks on the SpaceX side feed him tempered predictions, and those in Tesla do the opposite. It's probably not that simple, but I have come to view Elon's SpaceX proclamations optimistically while taking his Tesla ones with a mountain of salt.
That's $1.6B for a barebones global service. Basically good for remote communications and some basic data services that can afford to not have continuous connection. Keep in mind that a single satellite will go across your sky in about 6 minutes, so unless another one enters your horizon by then, you're going to have pretty spotty coverage. That also doesn't cover the cost of the ground stations required for these satellites to provide service in a given area. And the relative location of these stations to wherever your location will affect how much of that 6min/sat you can actually use.
In the call today they said that the Starlink satellites cost more to launch than to build.
Perhaps the release mechanism between the stacks are calibrated to different rotational speeds. So the stack at the top lets go when it gets to a certain speed, the next one at a slighly higher speed, and so on as the stage spins up. It appears that there are two sats per stack, which should then fly apart when they release from each other. We'll find out soon enough.
Yup, they didn't say how much though So I tried to err on the conservative side.
This is one of the few pros of Musk posting on Twitter - that picture of the 60 stacked satellites is nuts!

I need to learn to read what I quote. Sorry!
It's a giant deck of cards with extra Jokers and those little sets of instructions.
To clarify, the launch window open at 10:30PM ET/2:30AM UTC.
And here we were all expecting Starship to be crucial to being able to deploy Starlink on time, but at this rate not so much. Kinda funny that it's the other way around and that SpaceX actually needs Starlink to fund Starship.
How many people do you know that can do what Musk does, but are also impeccable in every social interaction? At my company, we have that ""one guy"" who shows up for 5-6 hours a day, has only two shirts (one with a hole in the elbow), communicates exclusively by IM and is excused from all the normal corporate BS (reviews, mandatory training, interviews, etc.), but here is the thing, his software returns 20x his salary annually, hence the free pass from normal social norms. Imagine ""that guy"" returning $2B+ instead of $20M and you find yourself in the Pedo Guy ballpark...
The 18.5t comes from Elon Musk. The 227kg may be dry mass. Now add Krypton for the Hall thrusters. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1128834111878193155
Umm, but that guy could never start a company, talk with investors, recruit, lead, etc. Musk was socially successful enough to do that... somehow.
Correct, but the launch *time* (T-0) is now 11 PM ET.
Half-hour delay: SpaceX Twitter:   https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1128841518599426048
Go, hot dog, go. Pushed to 2300 EDT btw. ... Also, this launch only expends the upper, it's a reused fairing, no?
No.
Consider the market for each company. SpaceX isn't marketing to the general public where puffery is often taken at face value. The people purchasing from SpaceX are large corporations/agencies that have more knowledge about what is or isn't possible/likely. It would be difficult to tell NASA or the US Airforce that something outlandish is totally feasible and think NASA or the Airforce would just accept that proposal at face value. So best to be blunt about possible success and failure rates than promise a lot but deliver little. That only works for big corporations with political clout that get no-bid guaranteed contracts no matter how much they screw up (I'll leave it to you to decide what corp I'm talking about). Tesla is marketing primarily to the average consumer. Puffery is the name of the game and a lot rides on the sales pitch alone. People buy all sorts of things that could never work as promised, or at least as well as promised, based on exaggerated claims.
For what it’s worth, I’ve been pushing the “Starlink pays for Starship” notion since the first time they mentioned the $30B revenue potential.
It seems to me that Elon has stated all along that they needed Starlink to produce the income to carry on with Starship, etc. I think it's been part of the business plan from the get-go.
I wish I was a billionaire that got to fund spaceship-building competitions.
I hope the Google reference is tongue in cheek, considering how big of a clusterfuck their product line is.
Well they aren't capsules. They are upper stages. Yes someday they may carry humans but that is likely a long way off. The starship will also be used for launching payloads into orbit. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that speed isn't the sole metric. Site A can build one starship per month. Site B can build two a month but 90% of the blow up before making orbit. Lets close down site A and go full speed ahead with Site B
A/B testing major hardware design and construction definitely seems like an Elon-idea and not a Shotwell-idea.
Because building two to seven of everything has worked so well for Google in areas like messaging. This seems like the kind of thing that sounds good but actually doesn't work in the real world. I hope I'm wrong.
When you're rich and have money to throw at your pet project, but you're still somewhat sensible.
Given the ambition, I hope the Starship is being built as an airframe only - and then general guidance as to how the internals should be balanced. In the same way that a 747 can be arranged in multiple ways internally but these being barely noticeable externally. We have to commoditise space as much as possible to allow increased flexibility. Or am I talking incontinent rubbish and entirely missing something?
Nice! I love a good A/B test.
A bit of both. Crew starship will presumably have a passenger compartment in the area cargo starship carries payload, and rich tourists will presumably get a different layout from initial mars colonists (a lot of space used for cargo), which in turn will differ from later colonization craft which are just people. Those bits can be airframed. Dedicated tanker starship is planned to chop off the nose cone area where cargo/passengers will be carried for a much shorter fairing and lower weight. The expendable cargo starship Elon appeared to napkin math out on Twitter a month or two back was even more heavily cut down.
I've reached the stage where I think SpaceX deserves a fair bit of credit for what they have achieved. I'd like to think that rather than some cutthroat competition, this is more collaborative and trying to take advantage of everyone's good ideas, rather than some insights getting overlooked as the team pushes forward with a single vision. It could literally just be a way of speeding up testing, making use of talent based in 2 different locations. Meanwhile, tonight SpaceX is (hopefully) about to launch 60 satellites as part of the first real push towards Starlink. Can't fault them for not being busy.
I can't help but be excited by every new Starship update. They are moving at incredible speed, and are so far seemingly living up to Musk's timeline. It sounds like we will have a flying Starship to watch over the Memorial Day holiday!
They are not A/B testing hardware design. Both sites are building the same design. They are simply using 2 separate fabrication crews to define best practices for fabrication of the rocket body and tanks. It is not a race, the winner will not be determined by who finishes first. As has been stated by EM repeatedly, they will be building Starships at both locations. This method allows them to work out the details of best fabrication techniques, and I'm sure both sites will eventually be using nearly identical processes once they get some experience with what works best.

Ah okay I see.
Two Starships are now under construction, with a hop test scheduled in two weeks. In other news, Bezos had a PowerPoint presentation about how he could build a lunar lander and O'Neil cylinders. I have my money on the guy who is actually building and flying things.
Bezos is playing a very different game. Most of his presentation was aimed at someone powerful who wants a legacy in 5 years time. Also note Blue Origins factory siting. Musk is seeing what can be done and trusting it will be awesome. So far, he's been right. I hope both are successful.
Never did I expect a day when Ron Amadeo's famous ""Google makes two of everything"" article would get linked in an Eric Berger article. Greatest crossover of all time!
I think you meant ""incoherent rubbish""
oh, no. I know what I typed
To be fair, Google's problem was never the development of products but an inability to commit to and support a product beyond a few years. Its the corporate version of ADD.
Is that really the example you want to use? Yes, Google duplicates existing products. But no, it hasn't helped Google achieve major success outside its core, decades old businesses of search, Gmail, and Maps. I'm not sure I can name a winner that came out of that strategy. Usually the older product prevails- Gmail over Wave, Google Maps over Google Earth, etc. Sometimes both fail, such as Android Wear vs. Google Glass. The trouble for Google is that you don't need two publicly released projects to try different two different approaches. You just have to get them far enough along that you can think critically about them and make a hard decision about which one is better. Take out the person making the hard decisions and you're left with a leadership void. Now what SpaceX is doing is actually much closer to what any regular company does- try multiple things during the R&D phase. They aren't actually going to mass produce two different and incompatible rockets that can't even work with the same payload adapters which would be the Google equivalent.
To be fair, once you realize Google actually only has one product (Search), with everything else being hobbies to keep the tekkies fed and happy and creative, decisions regarding investing in non-Search products become much easier...
Yeah, it's interesting to compare the 2 approaches. I think to some extent we are a bit spoiled with SpaceX and the amount of info the company (and Musk) put out there. They're obviously reasonably happy to allow some of their testing and failures to be seen too. They have had to produce results in order to get continued funding, and arguably one of their greatest triumphs is getting paying customers to agree to the company using launches for continued testing and evolution of the Falcon 9. Blue Origin is almost polar opposite. Apparently almost limitless funding, but playing cards pretty close to their chest. The assumption is that rather than lots of iterative development, they are instead planning very carefully for effectively the final model straight away. There was a decent sized part of me that was hoping the recent big BO/Bezos reveal was going to be a surprise announcement that New Glenn would be making it's first test flight next Tuesday. I knew it wouldn't be, or at least, it would have to be real Bond villain territory to get an orbital class rocket ready to fly without at least some news leaking out. I still hope they are making good progress though.
Also keep in mind that to realize Musk's Mars ambitions requires serious in orbit refuelling and that means having a sizeable fleet and multiple launch sites. In the near term this two site build and fly strategy de-risks program delays from specific site issues (accidents, regulatory road-blocks etc) and helps build towards long term goals of a high fleet construction and launch cadence capability required for Mars. This reminds me of NASA in the 1960's - actually having definite goals and working aggressively and effectively on many things in parallel to meet them. It is striking how much SpaceX stands out from everyone else in aerospace in looking and acting like they have both purpose and intent. Last edited by greybeardengineer on Wed May 15, 2019 9:04 am

Often I wish I could be frozen for two or three years so I don't have to wait for all these rockets (New Glenn, BFR, even SLS) to be built. Imagine waking up to an almost deployed Starlink network and videos of all the failed and successful launches! Plus new video game consoles will be out! (Yes, I know this is the plot of a South Park episode!)
You say that, but I bet the stress is unbelievable.
You typed search but I think you means advertising. Google is an advertising company. Their search is just a vehicle for their ad business.
If he's adamant about going mass-commercial then Continuity of Operations would require them to have two build sites anyway. Making them both 'A' grade (ie; each with their own design team, each capable of acting independently) is not that much of a step further. Last edited by MrElbbiw on Wed May 15, 2019 9:14 am
Could also be a lot of other things factoring in...like quality of output, worker skill/turnover (training new people takes time), how hard it is to get parts to the sites and the product to the launchpads. I see a lot of things they could consider.
What is the most amazing prospect is that the first boots on Mars MAY NOT be from a government-run space program. It may end up being a corporation like SpaceX that gets there first. I can't think of many sci-fi novels that predicted a corporation may get to Mars BEFORE governments did.
The future may be more Weyland-Yutani that Star Trek. On the other hand I believe that at some point if/when SpaceX looks to be getting close NASA will pivot and support a SpaceX based human mission to Mars. They will do it simply out of survival. If NASA isn't part of the first crewed mission to Mars well NASA or at least the HSF portion of NASA might as well close up shop. Last edited by Statistical on Wed May 15, 2019 9:21 am
A better comparison would be NASA. They famously build two when they have the money for it, it becomes useful in a variety of ways. The 2020 Mars Rover, for example, uses a lot of backup parts originally for Curiousity. This was parodied in movies like Armageddon and Contact. They even hired two of the same genetic human once as astronauts
Bezos doesn't seem to care for your money. He has enough of his own so that he can call your bet and keep playing. And it looks like he is committed to keep doing so for the foreseeable future.
The problem is you can't analyze your way to a perfectly working final configuration vehicle no matter how much effort and time you expend. You have to bend metal and fly and test. It is said that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy. In aerospace no paper rocket survives first contact with real life physics. Blue is going to run into issue and problems it hadn't considered fully and modelled with 100% fidelity and this will cause delays and design and procedure changes. I find Bezo's confidence quite arrogant - we will be able to fly and land even in extreme weather. That is rather tempting fate for a company that hasn't flown any type of rocket into orbit or attempted recovery of the first stage of an orbital capable launcher. SpaceX's approach is far more pragmatic and effective - build, test, fly, learn, and iterate. The sooner you build, test, fly, and learn the sooner you uncover the hidden issues and get to working solutions. IMO Blue is going to have to learn this the hard way. That is too bad because the new space revolution really needs two or more effective competitors to really get the ball rolling.
Agile Development SpaceX is having a competition to maximize process improvement in building Starship... While...Boeing can't put one SLS together. I spent 90% of my IT career building 3rd/4th generation ""traditional"" applications. Costly, rigid, single-threaded development life-cycle projects. Then, I moved into RAD and started managing millenials. Everything changed and I get it. Not many of my generation do. WHEN DONE CORRECTLY, agile development, be it software or hardware is a quantum leap forward. Boeing vs. SpaceX.
Quick, give rich campaign donors another tax cut so we can pay for this.
A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon, you're talking real money.
No no, it's not just rich campaign donors that need the tax cuts. The lower the tax cuts go for everybody (but the poor due to sales tax) the better the economy does. Then the economy DIRECTLY pays for EVERYTHING. Gosh, get your voodoo economics right. (edit for grammar) Last edited by Gabara on Mon May 13, 2019 8:45 pm
The money would be better going to SpaceX and/or Blue Origin. NASA will never get SLS off the ground.
Oh the money that could be going to Space flight is instead going to the border on a wall that we really don't need.
6-8 billion? Isn't this similar to the ""sticker shock"" that had been the death of many a space program project in Congress? Also, is this meant to be a one-time payment or spread out over several years? And worse, is Shelby going to play spoiler if he doesn't get his share for 'bamuh? IIRC, none of this extra money is going to SLS. Last edited by NezumiRho on Mon May 13, 2019 9:00 pm
I have to give them credit - Artemis is a pretty good name for the program.
NASA couldn't get back to the moon by 2024 if you gave them $1.6 trillion, let alone $1.6 billion. What vehicle are they going to take, the one that doesn't exist or the one that's been ""five years away"" for three decades? What would the astronauts do when they get there, plant a new flag and then run the same experiments we've done on the ISS a hundred times? You cannot inspire the public by doing shit we've done before. You cannot inspire the public by doing shit we've done before.
Hmm, maybe we should have Kenya Space Corporation do this instead... I'm thinking someone on the NASA naming committee is a book reader.
I wonder if they're deliberately making a quiet allusion to the Andy Weir novel, or if Artemis is just a sufficiently obvious choice given the mythological context. Regardless, The book maybe at least can be an inspiration, because the lunar city in it is ridiculously cool.
1.6 billion is such a small number in the grand scheme of discretionary spending that if the US couldn't make it back to the moon because of a shortage of political will to come up with this amount, it would be yet another sign that the country's political discourse has well and truly collapsed. That said, given NASA's track record, I'm a bit skeptical about the estimations here - NASA is certainly not above lowballing to get a project off the ground, and there's a question of whether the money could be better spent on exploring deep space or sending landers to the outer solar system. In an ideal world, NASA should have the budget to accomplish a moon landing and many, many more projects, but realistically any shot at a manned moon mission will heavily eat into the potential budget for genuinely unprecedented research.
So $1.6bn now, $24bn later for what is a presidential vanity mission, for a president who's likely to end up in jail. At this point I am guessing the launch site will be mar-a-lago?
Who's we? The last moon landings were nearly 50 years ago. The vast majority of humans have no memory of it. Also since when do human not get excited about repetitive events? Was this year's Super Bowl really any different from any other? Is this year's Game of Thrones any better than 8 years ago, aside from the promise that it won't happen again (until the spinoffs start spinning)? I don't think you have a good grasp on what it takes to get people interested.
How do you quiet critics that complain about the cost of human space flight and how the money could be better spent on social programs? Funnel more money from Pell grants. /s
NASA's budget peaked at around 4% of discretionary federal spending during the Apollo era. If they had access to the same funding today - around $200 billion per year - I'm fairly sure that they'd be able to put together a heavy lifter in less than 5 years. Building the rocket won't be an issue if they received the equivalent of 50 years' funding in 4 years.
"" the House Appropriations subcommittee that sets NASA's budget is chaired by New York's José Serrano"" Dead in the water. ""Money better spent..."" will be the phrase of the day when the request comes through. Last edited by BeowulfSchaeffer on Mon May 13, 2019 9:13 pm
Actually 1.6 is too small. The article said 6-8 billion/year till 2024 is what they predict they actually need to do this on schedule. Last edited by buback on Mon May 13, 2019 9:16 pm
If we maintained that level of funding and public enthusiasm I'm confident we would have permanent or simi-permanent settlements on the Moon and Mars by now.
And the NASA administrator denied that number and specifically called for 1.6 billion extra for the next fiscal year. Although as the article implied, the number is most likely far too small.
Dramatic underestimate given current zeitgeist.
An even better position though, because the rocket to accomplish this is already in the works, courtesy of Blue Origin and SpaceX. More treasure to spend on little things like spacesuits, landers, and more.
Much if not most of us at NASA would love to fully hand-over the vehicle to private sector but maintain oversight. Focus on the science and orchestrating the whole thing. Last edited by lee_machine on Mon May 13, 2019 9:20 pm
This sounds like an episode of scrapheap challenge but the scrapyard is SLS and you only have multiple billions to finish your moon shot project by the end of the episode...
I'm severely embarrassed that my first thought was ""huh, someone at NASA liked Ready Player One"", and not, you know, ""oh that's a good connection to the fairly standard NASA standard of using mythology to name things"". I had a stupid, and you're all witnesses. Last edited by Operative Me on Mon May 13, 2019 9:25 pm
Curious. I thought that most government contracts already worked that way, I.e. ""give me X and we'll pay Y"". My knowledge of such is admittedly limited though... And yes for Artemis as the name. All the yes's! *waves tiny Weir flags* 😁 Last edited by NezumiRho on Mon May 13, 2019 9:26 pm

Trying to say something there Jim?
The only thing I will give 45, is that he likes a show. The random person, oh 1.6bil for NASA, Yay. That is a dog and pony show. It would be nice, but the purse strings are held by congress. To quote the great Dr. Hibbert... Hillbillies want to be called sons of the south, but it ain't gonna happen. I'd love for NASA to get an extra 1.6bil for doing what they do, but SLS and the Lunar Gateway is asinine. It's a dumb waste of money and won't make it past 2020 regardless of the election.
You manage to highlight why pegging budgets to percentages of the overall budget is ridiculous. Giving NASA 200 billion a year would be absolutely insane given everything else the US should be funding more adequately like infrastructure. NASA’s budget adjusted for inflation, on the other hand, has been stable for decades. If you wanted to match their budget during the Apollo years 30 - 40 billion a year would be adequate. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA Last edited by AdamM on Mon May 13, 2019 9:56 pm
Funnily enough, read this just after listening to an old podcast between Andy Weir and Nasa's Jim Green (Gravity Assist), talking about his then upcoming book Artemis. What's next, a Weir Spaceport in Kenya?
Quote: ""Serrano was born in Puerto Rico and has condemned the Trump administration for what he characterized as the president's efforts to ""undermine"" the island's recovery after Hurricane Maria in 2017"" OK so this is the second time ars uses this formulation and it's just too weasel-y that it gets on my nerves. I understand it's not highly germane to the piece's primary focus- but having used it in two pieces, it seems more appropriate to take an extra word or two to comment on whether Serrano is right or wrong instead of lazily attributing this with a ""what he characterized as"" and using undermine with quotation marks. If you believe that the below is not undermining the island's recovery, say so, if not, say so as well. Or just describe what Serrano's objections are exactly. To quote Will Wilkinson: Quote: You can take anything that ever happened, describe it with nothing but strict facts, and build an infamous lie. Leaving things out can be horribly dishonest. Adding a detail or shifting something in time can leave the reader with a clearer true overall picture. This is the context of Serrano's letter: Quote: ""Today, Congressman José E. Serrano led a letter with 55 Democratic colleagues to condemn President Trump’s constant attacks and undermining of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico post-Hurricane Maria. The joint effort comes two weeks after it became public that President Trump was considering diverting U.S. Army Corps of Engineers funding appropriated by Congress for disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico in order to build the wall along the Southern border. More recent news reports revealed President Trump’s efforts to prevent disaster relief funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from being distributed to the government of Puerto Rico. The latest action from the Trump Administration to undermine recovery in Puerto Rico was its blatant and unreasonable objections to the inclusion of $600 million in funding for the Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP) in Puerto Rico and to the waiver of FEMA Categories A and B local cost share requirements in the Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) for the Emergency Supplemental (H.R. 268).""
Oh snap! Like that was an accident. :-D
Surrrrrrre! I like the ""JUST AS PLANNED"" school of thought. 😈
They want the democratic congress to cut the pell grants that pay for our next generation of engineers to pay for it right before the primary season where college affordability ranks up there with healthcare as hot button issues. It is DOA. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics ... story.html
Yes, and by being bold and repeating oneself it does not make for a better case. I agree I just found it funny to see a case against repeating oneself by repeating oneself.
<quote>I agree I just found it funny to see a case against repeating oneself by repeating oneself.</quote> Funny, I thought that was reason for the OP’s repeated sentence.
Have the economics really changed that much since Concord? At those speeds the fuel use will make tickets expensive. Special runways, noise issues - boys and their toys /shrug
To do good engineering, you need good science. I assume that in the field of aerospace, you need excellent material science research to help you build a plane, both the frame and the engines that can withhold tremendous forces of sonic flight
VC fools and their money are soon parted.   Nothing too miraculous, just an engine concept which has been on the tantalizing fingertips of the aerospace community for more than half of the history of human flight. We'll make a people-hauler out of it. cool cool
All of those are still issues. Unless their new aerospace designs will allow for shorter runways and lower noise pollution, the issue of fuel will remain. At best they will cater to an elite clientel of executives and celebrities who are willing to pay alot to travel quickly. Hopefully they will avoid the mishaps of the Concorde. No chance of dodging the expensive ticket prices though.
I have serious doubts that a Mach 2.2 passenger jet will be delivered within the next 10 years, even with airlines preordering them. This is hard and expensive work to build something that will be expensive to operate. I don't see that much demand for them.
Did Tom Haverford make that promo video?
Just watching all the eyebrow raising in that promo video tells me to run. But I always hope they succeed because it would be cool.
Unless they've miraculously solved the problem of sonic booms, these types of planes seem to have very limited utility. Though I'm sure the engineering will be interesting.
I note, with considerable disdain, the degree to which their ""concept"" is a concept in the design-school sense, not the engineering preliminary design sense. We have a pretty good idea of what a practical Mach 5 air-breather can look like. It looks absolutely nothing like that. 2D inlet buried deep in the boundary layer, tiny capture area, huge wings... c'mon, guys, you need to do more than put a plastic XB-70 model in the oven for an hour.
To be fair, that was the 1950's. We *have* improved propulsion and materials science since them. It's pretty clear that you can build the plane, but it's not clear that there is an economic reason to do so. Of course, any third world dictator would just love a fleet of these bad little boys.
This can, if built, outrun lots of anti-aircraft missiles.
Well, they have a merch section the their web site with not bad looking $25 T-shirts. That'll help bolster the fundraising!
Hopefully by the time they're technologically viable a big beautiful carbon tax prices them out of viability, because they're nothing other than a mechanism for the rich to s**t over the rest of us.
What's interesting is that NASA has been doing a lot of research lately on reducing the sonic boom of supersonic planes. I wonder if some of these new supersonic flight companies have been looking at this research: https://www.nasa.gov/aero/nasa-prepares ... sonic-tech
They are banking on a market for air travel as expensive in real terms as it was in the 1930s, when only the seriously rich travelled by air, and the modestly rich crossed the Atlantic by passenger ship. They need to have a word with the current US President, who seems determined to bring on a global slump. They also need to think about why anybody would want to travel from NY to Paris in one and a half hours (plus the additional three hours total in traffic at each end.) That was what sunk Concord(e): STD, the fax machine, then the Internet all combined to make very fast travel much less necessary for business, while in a contrary direction businessmen realised that long haul flights were the way to get away from the office for a few hours.
So they actively want to fly through a brick wall not just once, but continuously. Yeah. This is going to require a LOT of money to develop. IF they can develop this. Tech like this is the stuff the Air Force throws billions at over decades in facilities such as Area 51, Skunk Works, etc., to try and perfect. Thing is, not only are the body and structural dynamics important, but the engine technology gets quite ridiculous when you're trying to stuff air through a mechanism to produce sustained thrust at /this will probably tear your skin off if you stick your face into the wind/ velocities.

It is? Get on the phone with the Air Force, then -- they want it, bad, for ISR.
Just what your drug running Russian oligarch wanna-be supervillain absolutely needs these days. It's a rough world out there.
I thought that the SR-71 was supposed to be too high as well as too fast, and it turned out that the Soviet Union had thought of that one too. The BUK that caused the disaster in Ukraine was, I believe, operating above its supposed ceiling.
As sexy as planes are, I wish they made trains here in North America faster and more affordable.
The X-60A, which I guess hasn't flown yet? It's in partnership with the Air Force; hence the name. Makes me imagine a future with hypersonic cruise missiles... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud-dE1OnbFg
It's not a binary thing, a rock-paper-scissors declaration of immunity against a particular SAM system. The higher and faster you go, the less the effective engagement range (c.f., kinematic range) of the missiles you face, the bigger the load you impose on your adversary's surveillance and command infrastructure, etc. He has to start deploying more launchers, bigger and better radars, faster telecommunications... and maybe he can't afford it, or he can't figure out how.
The demand for supersonic travel is going down, not up. The reason is simple -- there is hardly any need to be in person for something so urgently in our globally-connected world. With next-generation satellite constellations coming, soon people have access to broadband anywhere on the planet. Why travel in a cramped supersonic shuttle when you can travel slowly in luxury with high speed internet to get work done, while being wined and dined? This is why cruise ships are making a come back too.
Look, they said they were 'just' doing engineering. Don't you believe them? Hell, they can probably 3D print it. Oh, and the SR-72 is Mach 6. Way different. Last edited by ColdWetDog on Mon May 13, 2019 10:39 am
Ten years. A LOTTTT can happen in that time.
Watching that promo vid, that was my very first thought. These guys are just milking some VCs out of their money. And with a 10yr plan, they'll be doing it for a long time.
Yep. Controlled fusion. Holographic Storage.
I wish the US commuter trains were also as comfortable as the ones in Europe and Japan. Every US commuter train (Amtrak, Metra) here in the Chicagoland area look and feel like they were built 40 years ago. A depressing experience every time.
Whatever... When a research/engineering team starts throwing out 5-10 years development time for anything, you can safely assume 25+ years or never.
They probably won't succeed (it's the economics, stupid), but I do want them to.
I wonder how they plan to handle the optics on the environment impact, specially nowadays when people are more critical of that? The Concord was way before my time (in terms of when I started doing traveling), but I remember even then, there was discussion about it having a pretty harsh impact on the environment. I could be wrong though. From what it sounds like in their proposal, they aren't looking at anything ground-breaking in terms of new tech, so basically using the current methods to achieve this, which means an increased environmental impact, no?
About that Mach 5 plane: For me the question is the size of it and connected to that the target consumer. If it's fairly small it could be something for the billionaire who does this kind of flight fairly often. Dropping a few 100k on fuel is something they can afford. If it's Concorde sized your target costumers are airlines and I don't think they can bring the costs down far enough to be economical for them. And even if it would just replace 1st class costumers.
You can stay in your office and just video conference instead of traveling. Cruise ships are self propelled floating hotels and are holiday destinations, not work spaces.
In fairness, Holographic Storage worked, at least well enough for archival storage type applications. There just wasn't anyone who needed/wanted that storage density, at that time. At least not enough to justify the added cost.
Some people will already spend from $5000 up to $20k just to be able to pass the whole flight in a cushy first-class cocoon for 10+ hours. That's the market they're going after.
I think this the corporate jet market rather than the airlines.
And what if it uses a carbon-neutral fuel?
Good news all around, congratulations to the Japanese startup. On reuse making things cheaper, the way I see it, is that with reuse and a more competitive launch market in general, the value of a launch in relation to the payload capacity is going from exponential (because the hardware needed is rarely built, so supporting the infrastructure to build and operate it is expensive) to logarithmic as a result of the economies of larger transport vehicles that are common across other transportation sectors, the $/kg obviously would approximate the slope of the tangent line if you were to graph it. As a result I think that somewhere in the 1t-2.5t range is a powerful position for a small reusable, obviously right now the name of the game is making money in the first place to continue development, but from there you would have the position to drastically influence what any smaller vehicle can reasonably expect to charge for their service. This is also why big expensive boosters like SLS were acceptable, until we had F9 and FH, it made sense for what it was supposed to do, until it didn't and the mental math already started adjusting the value of the service to the new scales.
Always nice to wake up to the Rocket Report. I'm so glad we have enough rocket news to warrant making something like this. Thanks
Sounds like Rokita's been playing KSP. A Falcon Heavy pushing nothing but propellant does equate to rather a lot of delta-v. Pity real in-space refueling is a little more difficult than right-clicking.
It also isn't that complicated depending a little on the prop. We understand how to transfer fluids in zero gravity, we've been doing it for decades.
Does anyone know why the increase in commercial launches didn't happen? From the Spacenews article:   Is it commercial communications companies cutting back on investment into GSO comm satellites in anticipation of LEO constellations? Is there something else behind this?
I would much rather NASA spent money on developing in-space refueling, as compared to the colossal waste of SLS that is not developing anything. The need and case for SLS was always questionable, though I'm willing to concede it was more arguable before re-use of F9 cores was demonstrated and before FH flew. While SpaceX's achievement with those is rightly applauded, I have to assume there's nothing magical involved, and others should be able to replicate them (BO being the candidate most obviously next in line). At that point, the potential progress that can be made with orbital refuelling (and more orbital construction) is almost limitless. More importantly, with re-use and re-fuelling and especially if there is competition between providers, it may be much more economical than anything we've done to date.
Time, and investigation of future architectures.
I'm no expert but I've seen references to the reliability and lifespan of comms sats increasing significantly over the years, coupled with a spike over the last few years leading to a downturn right now. There is then the shift away from normal broadcast media which would argue against increasing satellite broadcast tv capacity, and possibly even make it harder to justify the cost of replacing existing satellites. More generally, I suspect SpaceX may have been perhaps over-optimistic about expansion of the market, having assumed that simply providing cheaper access would fuel demand - for all launches, not just GSO comm sats. Cheap(er) access may well still do that, but they may have overestimated how long it will take for that to dramatically increase the number of launches.
Rocket Lab is really building up a lead in the small sat launch market. If you are an aspiring competitor in the same payload mass range you better be figuring out how to get to operations much faster and with more value added. Those targeting 300 to 1000 Kg payloads better get going before the Electron gets stretched or otherwise upgraded.
It is in a transition period right now with the advent of ample cheap reliable launch making entirely different architectures and business models than hyper expensive long life golden birds possible. The problem is right now cheap launch is only available from one vendor and that is dangerous to base a wholesale industry business model pivot on. Once Blue Origin starts flying with competitive pricing too the industry will be more willing to transition to more, cheaper GSO satellites with shorter lifetimes and more rapidly evolving technology.

The Arianne 6 slowly grinds onward. No measures like half measures except maybe quarter measures. I am sure the commercial launch market will be busting down the doors in two years to be first to fly on an expensive launcher with no flight heritage.
One reason is that HTS (high throughput sats) are greatly reducing the number of launches needed. Viasat-3 for example is 3 GSO sats that each have more throughput than the entire rest of the GSO sats in orbit combined. So today instead of sending up a half dozen GSO sats you can just send up one high throughput GSO sat. The other aspect is that while launchers have gotten cheaper that hasn't yet translated into cheaper sats. If you are going from $200M sat + $150M launch = $350M total to $200M sat + $60M launch = $260M total well it is cheaper but not enough to lead to a doubling in demand. Lastly comsats tend to be cyclical. There will be bandwidth shortages and rising prices which leads to multiple companies building sats with the long lead time that means it ends up taking 3-5 years to resolve itself at which point there is excess capacity, wholesale prices are falling, and everyone delays future sats because the ROI looks back. Then 5 or so years pass and bandwidth availability starts to tighten and the process repeats all over again.
Of course it has flight heritage! With the design pattern reuse and deep institutional knowledge it's effectively just a cheaper Ariane 5. Just like the 737 Max 8 is, pilot licence speaking wise, the same as an original 737. /s
Of course they will, because the politics are always what matters for old space companies. They will probably also keep most of the same jobs at the same contractors as the Ariane 5 while someone still hoping things will turn out cheaper. Good luck with that.
Human angle: read about the founder, Takafumi Horie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takafumi_Horie - an outlier in a culture where being an outlier is far more difficult than in Europe and North America. It took him over a decade to achieve this successful launch. Not unlike Soichiro Honda, who had to climb all the way to the top through numerous failures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soichiro_Honda.
I'll reiterate what I said at spacenews here. Aerospace is a slow industry. The lead times for satellite constellations takes years. The same goes for science missions from customers like NASA. There is a great deal of planning and logistics involved when going from concept to a real constellation in orbit. For example GPS has been around since the 70's but is only on its third generation. SpaceX was fortunate to come on to the scene right as several constellations were in the middle of growth and/or replacement phases, Iridium NEXT, Telestar and GPSIII for example. These launches were going to happen with or without SpaceX. They had been in planning for a long time. Yes SpaceX has changed the market in major ways and the only reason to launch with someone else is for scheduling and availability reasons. But we aren't likely to see the results of that change for several years at the minimum. Small sat is growing faster but that market has a much lower barrier to entry. Small satellites are cheaper, faster to build and have less inherent risk. Large and medium sized payloads are another matter entirely. They are expensive, slow to build, involve a lot of risk and there are only a handful vendors providing commercial buses. I think SpaceX should consider taking a page from Rocket Labs and offering their own bus, but appropriately sized for F9 and FH. That would help the market become more nimble and take a lot of risk out. They may do that with Starlink but those aren't in the same weight class as Iridium NEXT or Arabsat.
So is Arianespace going to keep a spare 5 around to launch JWST in 2028 or whenever it finally passes inspection? I haven't seen anything about how hard it would be to adapt to a new launcher, but I have to wonder how comfortable NASA would be with a less flight proven vehicle.
Yes, they've said they would hold an A5 back for Webb. Probably going to be the last one to launch.
I know Hyperbola is a mathematical concept, but give the similar phonetics to Hyperbole, it sounds more like satire of startup culture than a branded name a space startup is actually pitching as their product.
One cool thing about the Electron is that it gets ""free"" extra performance as battery energy density improves. The multi-engine approach gives the freedom to scale up for greater performance or to give enough margin for first stage re-use.
We need Orbiting refueling stations. No one loads a car with all the gas they need to go from LA to NYC and back without refueling. That is how traditional space business does it. You SHOULD be thinking of achieve orbit, refuel then go to the Moon or Mars.
Isn't it part of the deal that Europe provides the launch vehicle in exchange for time share on the telescope?
It's a bust so long as the fuel in those tanks has to be launched from Earth by disposable rockets. And that's a big part of why SpaceX's future architecture is a reusable tanker that comes up to top up the Mars-bound ship: it could just as easily top up a depot. Other fuel sources may be available: lunar water ice to H2 + O2 is good, but they all need developing. And yay, part of Blue's Blue Moon plan is to scout for that ice and see what's what.
I think that using moon water for propellant is going to be seen as incredibly wasteful by the thirsty lunar colonists who come later.
Also until we have utterly massive flight volume you don't really need a depot. You need to refuel but you don't need a depot. You can just launch tankers as needed to fuel the spacecraft. Someday we might need depots but right now simply getting to fully reusable spacecraft + refuelable spacecraft would greatly improve the economics of anything beyond LEO.
For a while, lots of people were launching satellites for TV service. That market is now saturated, and the satellites themselves are getting bigger and lasting longer. So fewer launches are needed for the replacement market.
They were also lucky that Russia decided to shoot itself in the foot in 2014. Iridium Next was originally going to launch on Depnr... Also Starlink sats are just a little bit smaller than Iridium Next, about half the size, which still puts them in a similar class
That is exactly SpaceX's plan for the SuperHeavy/Starship. Launch the 2nd stage to orbit with payload aboard, then multiple launches carrying fuel to refill it. I'm sure once they develop the propellant transfer and storage technology, they will find other uses for it that are smaller than ""land 100 tons on Mars"".
Another way to supply a depot is by ""scoop mining"". A long, narrow funnel is placed in about a 200 km orbit. A vacuum pump collects the higher density gas that piles up at the back of the funnel and pushes into a storage tank. Part of the gas is sent to an electric engine, which counters the drag the funnel creates. Since the engine exhaust velocity is about 5 times the orbital velocity of the funnel, you only need to expend 20% of the air you collect. Once the tanks are full, you increase the power or duty cycle of the engine, and climb up to a higher orbit, and unload at the depot. The numbers seem to work out for this concept, but nobody has ever tried it that I know of.
Water is one of the most common compounds in the Solar System. Some Near Earth Asteroids have up to 20% water and carbon compounds. Those can be reformed to oxygen and hydrocarbons i.e. propellants. Once you get to the middle of the Asteroid Belt (i.e. Ceres), it is cold enough to retain massive amounts of water, so you have ""wet"" bodies, and literal oceans underneath a crust of ice. https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/de ... d=PIA22660
That depends how much there is, and how easy it is to use, and how many flights and colonies we're talking. But we're still only looking at permanent-shadow ice, I think, and permanent-shadow slightly-icy regolith? It's almost self-limiting at that scale.
I wouldn't consider half the size as a little bit smaller. I would consider it half the size. Sure they aren't cube sats but they chonks either. Technically they do fall into the smallsat category.
As cool as an orbital gas station would be, the logistics don't support it at this stage. Comparing this to a car drive is specious because those logistics only work in a scenario where you have thousands of vehicles needing fuel that might stop by each year. Space travel is more analogous to naval replenishment where fleets at sea meet up with oilers that were sent to meet them at a predetermined time and location. Having those same oilers head toward an established fueling depot in the middle of the ocean saves the oiler time at the cost of the fleet's time and creates a whole new component that needs to be built and maintained (and protected). Space-based refueling? Absolutely. Dedicated depot? I can't see the benefit. Edit: typo.
Every time someone says something about using water from other planets I remember the Doctor Who episode ""Waters of Mars"". And maybe I'm a little optimistic (if you can say that), but I think the further we go, and the longer we stay in other planets, specially the ones with abundant water, the more likely it is that we accidentally have the first case of alien diarrhea, caused by some alien microbe our filtering system didn't get rid of.
SpaceX is planning to do tankers, anyway. Some seed money to SpaceX to develop the multi-fuel tanker and a standardized refueling architecture could advance the 2024 landing project.
The GEO drop is well documented. The lack of uptick in LEO missions is maybe explained by some math distributions for new tech. There is a well known 20 year adoption cycle for new tech and its ecosystem. So a countdown from the reuse era. That is pretty abstract though. The biggest gate is probably just coming up with new reasons to make a satellite. The small LEO ones are cheap to make and launch but they still need a reason to be up there. Communications mean you need a constellation which is not cheap. Earth observation is fine but there is an existing market. Does your smallsat have the right trade offs, or do you need more of them? So other than the coming constellations, it seems we have not invented enough new reasons yet to drive up launch cadence. My angle is that the constellations are going to change sat economics in a different way. Their mass production and built in communications means there is a resell opportunity for a cheap and well launched system for third parties. Maybe a customer plane or two gets added. They know how to communicate already and you clear out some space for customer activities. The Air Force already coughed up cash to look into this. So it is an uncertain time to do GEO, and the wrong time for a LEO scheme before we have a functioning constellation and can learn what it entails. Tl;dr I guess we are waiting for killer apps beyond the constellations?
To be honest, we are also still riding the cost curve on SpaceX. Customers have yet to see the pricing regime of an F9 launching 10 times till major refurb and then repeating that 10 times. Maybe if BO ever decides to do orbital launch the price competition will finally drive down costs to the mythical massive new market level?
The constellations will require such a large increase in launch cadence that it's almost possible to ignore all other satellites as a rounding error. That said, I expect we'll see SpaceX and the other providers selling their bus to all comers.

Hell yes, I would also love to see a launch and when the rocket lands by itself. I always wanted to see a space shuttle launch, first I couldn't afford to fly to the USA then I couldn't go because of family commitments and by the time I could go well the program finished.
I would love to see a Falcon 9 also make it to the Rocket Garden at Kennedy Space Center. It really does deserve a special place among the greats.
Go see one! I went with some friends to see the Falcon Heavy Demo flight and was not disappointed. It's really not too expensive, especially if you can take a week to work remotely, as we did.
Kudos to William Harris and SpaceX for this! Now, yes, that Rocket Garden at Kennedy needs to make some room too.
Having gotten to see the one at SpaceX headquarters up close, it's a pretty amazing sight. Definitely well worth having this one on display, particularly since it's the first one NASA reflew (the one at SpaceX HQ is the first one that successfully landed, for reference.) Because if they're not going to fly it again... ""It belongs in a museum!""
Perhaps they could organize a stadium tour where the rockets land at your local stadium?
It's nice to contemplate a world littered with old falcon 9 rockets. But I'm looking forward to worlds littered with old used BFRs.
We need one for the Smithsonian in Washington DC now.
Need one for evergreen next to the Titan II. That is all.
Soon there will be enough flight-proven Falcon 9 cores for all the museums who could want them. And that, my friends, is glorious.
That depends on whether they're allowed to retire, or if they're ""retired"" on a high mass/energy expendable mission.
Where would they put it? The Air and Space Museum in D.C. is currently being renovated. Even without that, they don't have nearly enough room for their full collection. I'd love to see a Falcon 9 there, but I'd hate to see them remove the Skylab flight spare or the flight spares of the Apollo-Soyuz mission to make room. How would you feel about putting it at their Udvar-Hazy Center, their annex museum outside Dulles airport? I think that would be a fine, practical solution.

Definitely have a good week spare to hang around. Nothing you can do about hardware delays, but at least a week should be enough to avoid missing it due to weather delays. Or, just wait until sometime next year when Starlink goes into full swing.
I agree. It depends on what you are interested in, but I'd put seeing a launch as a better vacation than going to Paris and visiting the Musée du Louvre. Of course, there are other things to do in Paris and there is the weather... But I really would recommend a week in Florida at a time you could watch a launch as a excellent vacation.
They're right. This would definitely be on my list of things to see during a visit to the city. To be fair, I probably would have gone anyway - but I'm sure that there are new people that will be drawn in (or old nuts that get drawn back) over and above the existing potential clientele.
Hmmm... I know people who work for the Henry Ford Museum, maybe I'll pester them into looking into this. Would be a nice bookend to go with the DC-3 and the Allegheny locomotive.
Actually, that would make a very nice exhibit. Most rockets are displayed at museums focused on spaceflight or air and space flight. A rocket at a museum which covered all historic forms of transportation would be a fine way of showing how the technology has evolved over centuries.
Totally cool, but hopefully they don't wait too long until they learn the lesson that the Museum of Science and Industry did with U505 - It's going to cost much, much more to do a proper renovation after years outside than it would to build an outbuilding. Even just a big canopy to keep the rain and sun off would make a huge difference.
The Air Force learned the same thing, also the hard way, with the XB-70 Valkyrie. They got the one surviving aircraft (of two built) for their museum at Wright-Patterson, and didn't have funding to take care of it. It ended up sitting out in the rain for a couple decades before they found the money to restore it and put it under a roof. Mistakes like that have happened enough times that the responsible people are aware of the issue. I hope they will be careful to avoid similar mistakes in the future.
Space Center Houston is also fully engaged in renovating the old Mission Control right now, so later this year will be a really good time to visit, even if you've been in the past.
I'm behind the times, it appears: Did they rename Johnson Space Center, or is Space Center Houston a different facility? edit: Got it, different facility, with a museum/educational mission.
SpaceX could fit decently sized office block into a disused BFR. Or a house. Now where did I put those millions?
Yes. Yes I do.
Hopefully they don't do the same stupid they did with the world's only Flight-ready Saturn V and leave it out in the elements for 30 years, destroying all the sensitive parts of the machine.
At least it won't be on display by the freeway for any moron to take pot-shots at in a the world's most confusing drive-by. https://www.space.com/15547-saturn-5-ro ... amage.html Don't think they ever caught the guy who did it. I was really hoping they would, if only to figure out what the fuck possessed him to do that.
""Here, hold my beer."" (While driving)
I had heard previously that SpaceX had approached museums and offered them the chance to have a decommissioned Falcon 9, and all the museums they'd talked to had turned them down. I always thought that was a bit sad. So I'm pleased to hear that's changing now.
If anyone actually does make it to Houston to give this exhibit a peek, make sure to also do the tram tour to see the Saturn V static display. If you catch it on the right weekend, you'll get the pleasure (?) of watching me give the tour, since I've started volunteering at Space Center Houston on some weekends as a Saturn V docent! (It gets me out of the house, at least—I'm sure my wife is grateful!)
Me too
Me too. I was down in Florida for one of the last shuttle launches in 2011 but the launch was delayed longer than I could stay. We went to KSC and enjoyed touring the facilities and seeing the shuttle on the launch pad (got some good pictures from where one of the RS-25's was on display, kind of a observation deck). We went down again last year to catch a Falcon 9 launch but it was delayed twice, putting it just outside how long we could stay again. I really, really want to see one of these launch so at some point I will plan on either seeing a FH or the first launch of crew to the ISS or Moon. I think about it and get excited as a school boy.
Need to have an ARSCalendar with schedules for catching these kinds of things.

My town is quite fond of the ""Put lots of Cold War jet fighters on top of concrete posts"" school of aerospace monument design. The Rust Check guys give each one an annual nooks-and-crannies spray, so they aren't corroding, but flat-finish military paint breaks down in short order and it doesn't take long before they start to look worn-out and sad. A few hundred thousand dollars to put up a basic truss-and-steel-deck roof over it, even if left unconditioned and with open sides, makes a *huge* difference.
It's disappointing that they would propose displaying the Falcon-9 on its side, when displaying it upright on its landing gear would show it off for the very reason its so important. I suppose, though, standing it upright would make it far too susceptible to the serious weather and winds Houston is often subject to.
About time.
When I come to State (not so near future, I'm afraid) it will be on my destination list

“Alabama”
One, it's a really big rocket. Two, work has to be done to prepare it for exhibit. That costs money, and that may be money may not be in the current budget, and warehousing it until such time as they do have the budget may also not be in the budget.
Ah, yeah, good point. It would take some prep for the exhibit, even if there's space for it, and of course that costs money. Someone in this thread mentioned setting up the rocket so it was sitting on it's legs (if there was vertical space for it). That could minimize how much design needs to go in the exhibit, but there are other issues that could require assistance from SpaceX, such as guy-wires and probably some kind of mechanical lock-out for the legs. Anyway, hopefully a few other museums will start considering trying to get one.
Considering the lack of modern medicines and medical science... I gotta think anything that takes the edge off of any kind of pain, toothache, etc would be popular.
Human ingenuity. From Day One.
Everything is a religious ritual to these archeologists isn't it? You can't even hotbox without them saying it was for religious reasons. Can't even bury a real party animal with his favorite grass without them saying it must be an offering.
It was an offering. ...To the Party God.
You have obviously never hot-boxed. Tis a religious experience.
This is a really interesting article, I just have one, small complaint:   The rest of the article was really good at using 'cannabis' but this errant 'marijuana' made it in.
You should be careful assigning the Western idea of ""religion"" as in ""worship of a deity"" when an archaeologist suggests a religious overtone to a situation. In antiquity, it's just as likely to be simple superstitions or local practices of honoring the dead and living/life to be considered religious. It's the ritual that is being displayed, and the dispensation of the dead is often religious in tones even if it's not involved in Western style religious worship. Instead it could simply be veneration of the ancestors and appeasement of their ghosts by offering a pleasing scent identified by the living to the dead. Humans are a sentimental people.
""Ritual purposes"" is often archeologist-speak for ""we don't know.""
Nitpick: In the paper the cemetery's name is spelled 'Jirzankal'. Google Translate thinks the word is Hausa, meaning 'sandwich'. I have no idea if that's the correct meaning in this case. Last edited by gungrave on Thu Jun 13, 2019 9:55 am
Maybe for ancient people getting stoned was a religious act. To our long-ago ancestors religion was more akin to casting spells than anything familiar from modern forms of worship. The world was controlled by spirits--some hostile, some benign, and some friendly to humans. Offering the spirits a nice, fat spliff could help guarantee a good place in the afterlife for granddad.
Sandwich seems likely, with the munchies they probably had.
We should be careful about attributing a recreational motive to this practice. Burning does not equal ""smoking,"" even if you're trying to produce smoke. We don't talk about ""smoking incense."" I think that distinction is getting lost in the media coverage. I'm not saying they didn't get high from burning it, or like that aspect, but historical scholarship demands a certain distance.
Wait until Muslim and Jewish faiths discover that the ""stoning"" commanded isn't quite what they thought....
If I know my stoners, there was a 26 year old guy named ""Chad"" who'd show up to play John Mayer on the angular harp to try and impress some teenage girls.
Now it feels like I am getting in character when I smoke hella bowls while playing the new Total War game.
Where in China is Jirzankou? By Western China I'm going to guess that it's in Xinjiang meaning that the early stoners were likely not Han Chinese. Last edited by deanzaZZR on Wed Jun 12, 2019 3:48 pm

I've always found this sort of thing fascinating. One day, some random guy with absolutely no knowledge of science or medicine decides to set a plant on fire and inhale the smoke.
Ritual, yes. Religious? There's a fine line there. For example, people have funerals. They're not religious in and of themselves. They are ritualistic, though, having a form and function that serves a particular human need. A ritual most people don't even think about is simply getting up and getting dressed in the morning. If you always putting on your pants left leg, right leg, button then zip, then one morning do it differently, you feel ""weird"", and might have a messed up day because you're feeling off. That's a ritual for a person by definition. It's a form and function that serves a particular need - to stay on track for your day's activities. Religions USE rituals, but the form and function doesn't necessarily serve the same kind of needs. They're also more formalized and dogmatic. You normally can shake off a ""weird"" feeling from not doing your normal morning rituals, but religions have more perceived, or real ""consequences"" if you don't follow the dogma. Man is a tribal animal, after all. If you're not toeing the religious line, you may be kicked out of the tribe, which would lower your chances of survival. In the case of cannabis use, this may have been riding the line between ritual (helping out with the grief of losing someone) and religion (preparing that someone for the afterlife, or using the drug to ""go with them"" on the journey - whatever serves a more religious purpose). Rituals seem to address more practical matters, while religions tend to wander away from practicality a lot more. Calling it a ritualistic practice is certainly accurate. I'm not sure how much ""religion"" was involved in it's use, if one defines religion as ""worship"" of something. Ancient Chinese had a definite ""king of the gods"" and up to 200 different minor deities, plus a belief in a kind of ghost/zombie mashup that's uniquely Asian by 1600 BCE, but by 500 BCE, Buddhism had been a thing for about 200 years, filtering into China, followed by Confucianism at about the same time (which shares traits with Buddhism). Taoism came along about a hundred years later. It seems to me that any of those philosophies (they're not traditional ""religions"" in a sense of worship, after all) would be one that the ritualistic use of pot would facilitate. It'd be interesting to know if any of those philosophies had gotten to that region of China, and if so, how much influence they may have and on the rituals the people practiced. It may have had something to do with why pot as a mind-altering substance wasn't used until those philosophies became more popular.
A mature plant can look & smell pretty impressive... they most likely saw animals chowing down on the buds, and followed suit, possibly getting enough of a body high to become interesting in the plant. Drying might've come soon after, etc.
It was the little-known Bong Dynasty. They didn't have much ambition for empire building, but they were known for epic music festivals.
Hell, if I didn't have the internet I'd be setting shit on fire all day, too. Wouldn't you? /gets coat.
I wonder when historians will figure out that humans actually invented agriculture to get high. If you experiment with a new technology, you start small. Cultivating plants to eat means great volume. But there are things which work in small dose as well... (It was intended to be a joke. Originally. )
Doesn't this boil down to ""If you do something in a particular way more than once, it's a ritual""? Doesn't seem like a very useful definition. I mean yeah, using a lighter to light a cigarette and take a puff could be considered a ritual, but that's not how the people actually smoking think about it.
The site is way, way too early for either Buddism, Taoism or Confuciusm. 500 BCE would make the smokers Confucius' contemporaries, and people didn't quite care for his schtick during his life. Buddism was a thing in 500 BCE but not in China, the earliest Chinese records of Buddism would not show up until three centuries later. It's doubly improbable for anyone in western Xinjiang in 500 BCE to have heard of any of these people. The Zhou dynasty's sphere of influence simply didn't reach that far. It's most likely that these people would not even have been aware of the dynasty itself, let alone schools of philosophical thoughts and organized ritualistic behavior of the era. Jirzankal is on the Pamir Plateau, hundreds of miles away from the nearest bit of (relatively advanced) civilization. Here's a picture showing the site's location. ""Located in modern-day China"" would be a better description, historically the area would have either fallen under one of the many nomadic tribes or, closer to present day, inhabited by the Kyrgyz. It would be a couple centuries before Chinese explorers set foot in the region, that's how remote the site is. That said, I find it intriguing that hypothetically, Confucius could have been a pothead. That would actually explain a lot.
John Savard wrote: Varieties of hemp that have less THC have more CBD... and CBD also has medical uses. So it can be produced by using hemp instead of marijuana, which could help make it easier to produce. There's little to no research supporting the use of CBD on its own. It would seem that CBD only works in conjunction with other cannabinoids, so we still need to deal with the asinine prohibition. Also, the prohibition was explicitly racist and denounced universally by medical professionals when enacted, so that's an issue worth dealing with on its own, rather than looking for ways to tiptoe around the issue to prevent upsetting the theocrats who are the only major group still in support of prohibition. Also, fun fact, they invented the term 'marihuana' (later 'marijuana') in order to get their ban passed. It sounded more foreign, so it was better to scare white people with, and hemp farmers were tricked into not realizing their livelihood was being targeted. Other fun fact, the real reason for the prohibition was to prop up DuPont, who was afraid of competition with hemp farmers and was looking for a way to eliminate them entirely. Some fun lies from the father of cannabis prohibition, Harry Anslinger. Historical note, ""jazz musician"" is code for non-white. Quote: I wish I could show you what a small marihuana cigarette can do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents. That's why our problem is so great; the greatest percentage of our population is composed of Spanish-speaking persons, most of who are low mentally, because of social and racial conditions. Quote: The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races. Quote: Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men. Quote: Marihuana influences Negroes to look at white people in the eye, step on white men's shadows and look at a white woman twice. Quote: Some people will fly into a delirious rage, and they are temporarily irresponsible and may commit violent crimes. Quote: Marihuana is the most violent drug in the history of mankind. Quote: ...there was a religious and military order founded which was called the Assassins and they derived their name from the drug called hashish which is now known in this country as marihuana. They were noted for their acts of cruelty, and the word ""assassin"" very aptly describes the drug. Quote: It is dangerous to the mind and body, and particularly dangerous to the criminal type, because it releases all of the inhibitions Quote: Marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing. Quote: Most marijuana smokers are colored people, jazz musicians, and entertainers. Their satanic music is driven by marijuana, and marijuana smoking by white women makes them want to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and others. It is a drug that causes insanity, criminality, and death — the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind. Quote: Marijuana is taken by musicians. And I'm not speaking about good musicians, but the jazz type. So yeah, let's stop looking for ways to preserve that law. Also, how depressing is it that nearly 100 years later telling a bunch of obvious, contradictory, insane lies that are universally rejected by the actual experts in the field (immigration, economy, Trump, etc.) to scare white people into giving more power to the already powerful still works?
Unlikely. The plant produces THCA which must be decarboxylated to the THC which gets you high. This means the smoking bit is important, unless you are carefully applying heat some other way.
Besides inventing Go, apparently they also created the first version of Dealer McDope! https://images.app.goo.gl/9ru1rt6ABCTAiRAM9 Confucius say...what?
You can also age it and let the process occur naturally, but it takes a really long time and is very inefficient.
The first use for grain crops was to make beer. The whole bread thing came later after brewing provided yeast.
Ardent Cannabis decarb machines are quite good and more reliable than Pyrex in the oven. Doubles as oil infuser, with excellent extraction percentages.

And even where cannabis doesn't directly help with the pain, it helps indirectly by distracting you by making you high. It reminds me of this old Lewis Black bit: Quote: I like having a cold. I get to take my favorite drug, which is NyQuil… NyQuil is 180 proof. It’s the moonshine of medicine… When I got a cold I want something that’s going to screw me up. Because that way the blur seems interesting. NyQuil comes in two colors: red and green. And it’s the only thing on the planet that tastes like red and green. Never mind that NyQuil was never over 10 abv, but he's got the right idea -- when you're sick, any way of getting fucked up can offer some relief!
That's a bit off the reality. Certainly various grain cakes / unleavened breads existed concurrently and likely well before beer.
The is true. There are varieties of hemp that have low THC and higher CBD levels. They can and are being used to make CBD. CBD powder and ointments do help many with back pain and other issues.
I bet it belonged to Thorin Oakenshield....
So a warrior's bark was tougher than his axe's bite?
I'm a little unclear; was it just folded the once, or were there multiple folds? Even now, multiple layers of relatively lightweight fabric (kevlar, etc.) are remarkably effective at dissipating large amounts of kinetic energy.
Even if it was somewhat vulnerable to melee weapons, a light shield like that would have been valuable for skirmishers.
BBC had a piece on the artifact a few days ago. https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lei ... e-48377927
When you use a shield you don't do a direct interception of force, it is meant to cause blows to be glancing. Thus this requires the shield to not be nearly as sturdy.
Indeed. People often don't account for how heavy 'a few pounds' can get when you're swinging it around (a sword) or carrying it semi-extended in a deflective way for 10-20 minutes or maybe longer in a larger battle. Also, put those actions on top of running.
That was my thought as well. A lighter shield would actually be more effective in that scenario, as it can be moved faster into the right position. Finally, since arrows rely on speed to impact kinetic energy, a springy shield made of layers of light materials should be more effective than a wooden shield: the give of the shield reduces velocity, therefore reducing kinetic energy transferred to the shield itself. If the shield gives just enough to reduce the velocity of the arrow below the threshold necessary to pierce the bark, you have a much better shield than one where the arrow hits solid wood and sticks to it.
For further context for everyone else: swords rarely weighed more than 3 lbs and battle axe heads more than 1.5. Even the massive Claymore sword weighed less than 6. Last edited by IntellectualThug on Fri May 31, 2019 11:19 am
Iron age plywood. They even found a different type of proto plywood in King Tuts Tomb.
I wonder how it would compare to the hypothetical ""great grand dad's"" bronze hoplite.
Agreed, hence ""a few pounds"" as stated. 3 lbs doesn't seem like much but wielding it in anger for several minutes or longer and it'll be fairly heavy. For those without access to a real sword try a 32 oz. hammer and pound some 16D nailes for 10 minutes solid to get an idea.
His or Link´s?, one of the two for sure
"" we can only guess at the meaning of the checkerboard pattern etched into the surface of the bark, painted red with pigment from the iron-rich mineral hematite."" Obviously was a contestant on ""Decorate your Battle Gear""(TM), only on the History channel....
It may have been ""chucked in a hole because it was no longer needed,"" and showed signs it may have been pierced by a spear? Did they dig a little deeper and find remains? Fascinating story, by the way.
I wonder if it might also be interpreted as a trainer of some sort. Similar to Japanese Bokken. Still usable for light combat, but quick and cheap to construct.
Well, it sounds like it was reasonably effective. But it also could have been a training shield - I'm certain that even back in those days they realised the benefits of training. And why waste a good shield on training? On the other hand, the fact it was finished with a border, and painted, maybe suggests a real battle shield. Or maybe there was a lot of time in the evenings since they didn't have Netflix to decorate even training shields. As a benefit, the training shields could be used in an emergency. Maybe this was.
That depends entirely on the style of combat for which it was used. As a shield-wall stationary line weapon this is useless. You'd be much better served by something like heavy plywood-construction linden. For a more mobile variety of combat, like raiding, this would very well have its place as something light and portable with adequate protection.

Most of them are just over 2 lbs and the right length for a sword (the balance is a bit off, but it's close enough for a mass simulator).
I'm not an expert, but I think you are over-generalizing? It depends on the military tactics right? Hoplites phalanxes needed stronger shields because they used close formations and long spears to defeat enemies and weren't in a position to create glancing deflections - their shields would have needed to be sturdier than open formations of lighter infantry, who might have had different tactics?
Looks like the ""restoration process"" did more damage to the shield than anything else!
Seeing as this was found in a livestock pond, the owner may have been part of a security detail for the herd-minders rather than infantry. The checkerboard decoration may have been a tribe or clan color scheme.

As long as it doesnt take away his druid spells
Couldn't have. Probably belonged to his cousin, Fleet Alderbarkshield.
We need not necessarily think of this being the ""standard"" shield of the fighters at the time. The youngest men in early Roman armies were deployed as lightly-equipped javelin throwers, and it is quite possible some British Celts employed their youth likewise. (Italian-ish Celts defeated a Roman army and sacked the city right around this time - there was plenty of cultural exchange going on.)
It's fine as long as the main hand weapon is a club, dagger, scimitar or sling.
CraigJ needs to slip a +2 bark shield into his D&D campaign.
Nitpicking:   I think you meant 'When in doubt'.
No, he's attacking in a moment of vulnerability.
Haven't read the book in a few decades but this was the first thing I thought of when I read the headline. Funny what sticks in one's head.
I thought that, too. Are you saying it's funny like a clown?
IIRC the Spanish invaders of Meso- and South America used bamboo armour, which was light and extremely effective against the weapons they faced. Also, bark canoes are very sturdy.
Albino_Boo - so, this is one of those cases where what we ""think of"" without actually handling the military hardware or knowing anything about the hardware is something of a false friend. (Indeed, that's probably part of the experimental archaeology being done on replicas of the artifact.) When people think of a shield, they generally think of a hard object that deflects any blows aimed at it. Well, either that or the energy shields from Star Trek, but those don't and have never actually existed, so I'm ignoring those. However, a shield is also a piece of ablative armor. The human holding a shield can control it to deflect an attack, however, in the worst case, a shield breaks so that its human doesn't. So, a shield will do its final job, if it takes a hit, and breaks, but without the human using it being damaged. Based on the hole in the artifact, it seems like this is what happened to the artifact the article is about. (One also can't dismiss the possibility of a pissed-off woodpecker, but I'm not sure the evidence lines up with that.) One cool thing about any armor system is that, if an attack can't be deflected, it is beneficial to simply catch and arrest the attack. Again, the spear hole in the shield suggests that's what the artifact did. What's more, the bent-bark/""plywood"" consruction was able to make the artifact actually do that; each layer's deformation was stopped by a subsequent layer, to the point that the failure of the artifact to stop the attack probably made the attack far less effective. If you want to see other shields that would defy your expectations, you should take a look at African hide shields used in tribal ritual combat: When dealing with small arms, the combined toughness of the animal hide, with the framed construction, will let the shield absorb most of the impact of an attack. Of course, context matters, and one of the key points of African tribal combat is that it's A) ritual, and B) petty disputes in a largely agrarian/hunter-gatherer society; generally, you don't really want people dying, that would be really really bad in a wide variety of ways. So, it's not a perfect comparison to the artifact the article is about, but still. The mechanical point of absorbing impact stands. Lastly, on the point of reality being unrealistic, one should take a moment to appreciate gambeson armor systems. Yes, cloth armor did exist and was possibly widely used, however D&D misrepresents cloth armor as being ""bad"", as does most of modern pop culture. As far as being an inexpensive, yet effective, armament, gambeson was A) likely omnipresent, and B) is known to have formed a foundation for a number of armor systems, including mail circa the time of William the Conquerer, plate armor from the High Middle Ages, and was sometimes used to good effect on its own. Of course, gambeson (and leather armor pieces) are made of organic materials, so they succumb to the passing of time. We'll probably never actually know how wide-spread gambeson or leather armor usage actually was, unless some kind of records or a particularly big archaeological find are unearthed. TL;DR - All of that is simply to say this: based on the article, it seems likely that bark shields were a ""boring, but practical"" armament that were easy to build, and possibly very effective for a militiaman to use in combat. Yes, they weren't the equal of a sturdier shield, regardless of material, but they also didn't necessarily have to be. Last edited by Asvarduil on Fri May 31, 2019 4:12 pm
From the article,   No it's not. Not debatable at all. These people didn't spend hundreds or thousands of hours and huge resources in terms of wood and manpower building encircling trenches, palisades, and other defensive emplacements around their villages just to keep up with the latest hipster decorating trend. You spend a lot of time and manpower on large-scale defenses because you're under very likely threat of actual attack, or actual attacks have already been perpetrated on your village. So no, it's not ""debatable"" at all.
While interesting, let's also remember that the whole point of earthworks and defenses is to fend off enemy humans. If the earthworks and defenses did their job, they seriously cut down on the number of close-combat incidents in the given area. I'm not sure in the article that the artifact was noted to be near any ruins. In fact, I recall the artifact being found in what was likely once a bog, likely due to a tradition of the time where the damaged hardware was decomissioned/honorably discharged. Unfortunately, such a disposal probalby tells us less than we'd like to know about the circumstances around the battle-damage that the bark shield sustained.
So you think the leaders of these villages managed to get their people to build up these major defenses without any actual combat having occurred in the area, ""just 'cause maybe...""? From village to village to village? Remember, the fortifications were commonplace. That's more likely due to actual experience of violence than by some stroke of political genius to get these people to put in that much labor on a ""scare."" If the defenses did their job, they cut down on direct hand-to-hand fighting within the village itself. But you still had the farmers outside the ""walls,"" tending the fields unless the village was being actively attacked or under siege and, given the level of frequent violence evidenced by the widespread nature of villages with significant defenses, you'd want to guard those farmers at least nominally. Those guards are going to see lots of action in an environment like this, even if they were simply farmers themselves with ""additional training."" This particular shield not being near any ruins means precisely nothing. If it was really EOL, it may well have been discarded near the site of a fight or battle outside the defenses of a village, out at the edges of the farmland.
Really cool archaeology research here. This gives a more intimate view into a family that lived 14,000 years ago. Its incredible to see they cave explored as a family, braving the darkness hopefully just for the adventure. Good article Kiona.
Climbing through caves and tight spaces with modern tools is scary enough. These people were braver than I am.
They were actually looking for cake, but we know how that turned out.
HOPEFULLY, but I can also imagine they may have been on the run, trying to hide from someone or something. Yikes!
""Basura"" means ""trash"" in Spanish. Wonder if it means something similar in Italian (Google Translate isn't helping me).
This can't be repeated often enough. Personally, whenever I read speculative reports about religious/spiritual/ceremonial reasons for something, I replace it with ""culinary"". Based on the law of averages, it's probably safe since people spend way more time concerned with food.
You can imagine it but I would hope that the toddler wouldn't be bringing up the rear if they were fleeing from danger. However, I will admit that I don't know the priorities of stone age peoples.
Cool. Nice write up Kiona.
Not very dangerous. Most caves have multiple entrances to the surface and due to this a breeze will blow through the system, keeping the air fresh. Those torches were pretty small compared to the airspace of the cave. They weren't exploring a tiny closet here.
The description of the scene in the chamber with the adults feeling the ceiling and children playing on the stalagmite is so wonderfully domestic. It reminds me of when I went car shopping recently and my wife and I were checking out the panoramic roof and our son was playing with dealership supplied toys. Funny that someone would think that's ceremonial in nature.
Something about the narration really touched me. I guess it's that the image of these people from a long gone time doing what I could see myself doing anytime made them feel really close and human in a way that other archaeological reports don't. Edit: exactly, yh
It never ceases to amaze me the things we find about the history of the planet and how well preserved some of this stuff is.
Watch the video. The people are tiny compared to the volume in the cave. Large volume means lots of oxygen. It also means lots of volume for any toxic gases to diffuse into. Your worries are misguided.
A little poking around the net shows this ""Grotta della Bàsura (the Witch's cave)"" http://www.toiranogrotte.it/en/basura-cave https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toirano_Caves and a slightly more technical, http://amq.aiqua.it/index.php/issues-20 ... italy/file by the way, it's not that far to Spain, so I guess that's the origin. (@400 miles) edit, I just realized that it's also known as the cave of bears, and basura could be ...of bears. Ursa means bear in latin. Last edited by fsurfer on Wed May 29, 2019 1:45 pm
“Bàsura” means “witch” in the local dialect of Liguria, the region in northern Italy where these caves are. I am from a nearby region. Fascinating article, I am going to visit the place!
i had similar thoughts regarding these activities. like birds constantly scanning the sky for predators as their young chicks peck away at the nest in idle amusement, the common behavior as the age groups advanced with a brain functioning for either survival or just 'having a day out exploring"" (looking for tracks of people who came before them. (Hey woman, lets take the kids into that cool cave my cousin told us about, and see if anyone has been there before! Maybe we'll find something besides predators or snakes we have to deal with on the sunny rocks! Mind your head, this is getting kind of low here...) can the order of who went ahead of who be determined? can we surmise if the male was deranged and leading his fam into the darkness after eating some wild hallucinogenic plant/berries (by accident?) so many unanswered questions to amuse with...
It always amazes me that something so ephemeral as a footstep can last 14,000 years.
We have 65+ million year old footprints from dinosaurs.
In the future, I can assure you anthropologists will be making a big deal of the Automotive Ceremonies of the 20th and 21st centuries.
'Making a big deal' = 'Wondering if this was the tipping point of the Great Decline'.
ahh, ""the future"", as we revel in ""the past""! if the next few generations of 'automobilists' continue to suckle away the energy resources that have been sequestered for a few million years (as fast as they can get wherever they absolutely need to be), the few who make it to that 'pie in the sky' exoplanet may well have some tales to tell once they arrive on their new turf. see, i'm not being a skeptic at all, being assured that someone WILL discover a way to escape this dreary old orb we now hasten to save for all that seeks to live here. annnd, im not going to 'cave' and act as if my sense of disbelief is unwarranted or even displeases others. /S
Took kids cave exploring SMH poor parenting. Of course I kid. A very touching family story from 14,000 years ago. I like this article.
""Jump"" van halen accompaniment
Heh, I might start mentally translating it that way in the future. Usually I just translate ""possible ritual use"" as ""not really sure what it was for"" and ""use unknown/multiple theories about its use"" as ""even the best archaeologists have no f***ing idea what this is"". I was at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens a few weeks ago, which among other things has a great collection of artifacts from neolithic and bronze age Greek civilizations. I was amused by all of the items they called ""frying pans"", which they straight-up said were certainly not used for food prep. Since there's no solid theories about what they actually were used for, though, the name of the thing they vaguely look like has stuck.
Quote: “Most likely they were pushed into the cave by simple curiosity and a sense of wonder for unexplored places,” archaeologist Marco Romano of the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, told Ars Technica. This was an unfortunate assertion in the face of this: Quote: Although some archaeologists have suggested that this might have been part of a ritual of some sort, there’s no way to be sure of that—and it’s important to remember that not everything ancient people did was ritual or ceremonial, any more than all of our random daily activities are today. The fact is, there's no way to be sure of what motivated the family to go in there. Curiosity and a sense of wonder seem rather pointless in the face of what they did as a family. And if folks say it's important to remember there's no way to be sure it was a ceremony or a ritual, then there's no way to be sure of anything - especially something as nebulous as curiosity and a sense of wonder (for a FAMILY??). I could believe that if it was one person, or a small group of adults. My impression is that it had significance to the family in some way. Not necessarily in a ""curiosity and sense of wonder"" manner, but one much more compelling. Ceremonial or ritual is definitely a possibility but without knowing more about the ""art work"" at the end of their journey, it's difficult to say. And it's not any more likely to have been curiosity and sense of wonder than it was ceremonial/ritual, or some other reason (like a coming of age rite where one of the family makes their mark in a special place and is witnessed by the rest of the family even if the youngest decide to paint stalagmites). That it was a family thing seems pretty obvious. But what that thing was can't be definitively determined from the facts in the article and speculation of any kind seems kind of pointless without facts to back it up. It's fine to wax poetic about some things, but it's best to stick to what we know based on the evidence when it comes to science.
Awesome! Thanks for another great article Kiona
I favour ""Hey, why don't we see if the emergency exit is any use, before we move in.""
That's dangerously unscientific speculation there. Surely this was done for religious purposes of some kind.
You know, I think it was a family outing. My own used to go to the beach, then just walk up as far as we could (usually 5 miles or so) just to see what was on the path ahead of us. When we went camping, we would purposely go way out of the campgrounds and would always make sure to mark the trail as we went in. Of course this was before the days of cell phones, when three of us were current or former Boy Scouts, and we certainly took enough food and water with us along with other things (water filtration and purification, waterproof matches and the like). This was because my parents wanted to really emphasize exploration. Even today, I do the same. Perhaps this is what those parents wanted to instill in their children too.
""When word got out about what they’d found, tourists and curious locals flocked to the cave and trampled quite a few tracks in the process."" Goddammit humanity. ""Here's something really cool and interesting, let's trample all over it and trash the place before we can learn anything about it."" Every archaeological site seems to be either robbed, vandalised or just carelessly spoiled before anyone sensible gets a chance to actually study it.

As someone said, it was actually culinary. Though we can't rule out a political, or even medical purpose. Possibly quantum mechanical.
""Just how dangerous is it to have a burning torch inside a cave?"" Not very. Carbide caving lamps were common until pretty recently, when more efficient LEDs became the norm. Still see them occasionally but they're banned in several places due to the sooty deposits they leave on cave roofs (they are also more likely to disturb hibernating bats).
Oh my Ford!
The family was house hunting.
Fascinating insight into a prehistoric family adventure. Reminds me of the equally fascinating finds in the Cosquer Cave near Marseille, France accessed underwater (and rapidly being submerged due to rising sea levels), especially the children's hand marks in the soft rock surface of the ceiling. The marks are found high above a normal infants reach range which indicates they were lifted up by adults in order to make the marks, seemingly in a similar playful way; though also reflecting the numerous ochre stencilled hands which are more deliberate acts (than remnant footprints for example). These include examples where fingers are apparently missing also. Handprints of children have been observed in the mondmilch (i.e. the white altered soft surface of the limestone wall) of relatively high walls, at more than eight feet from the ground. This means that kids did have access to the deepest parts of the cave, and also that they were held up at arm's length or on the shoulders of grown-ups so that they could imprint their hands high up on the surface of the walls. This cannot be construed as a random gesture but as a very deliberate action; source: linked below. Good article that discuss this in more details with images; Prehistoric Images and Medicines Under the Sea
ok, now do a T-Rex!
I’m not sure the mouse agrees This is amazing though. I grew up knowing it was a laughable noob question whether we could get colours in fossils.
Looks like something Andy Warhol would create.
I didn't know pheomelanin broke down more readily in fossilization. Guess that means they'll think I was an albino in a few megayears.
Well, there are much worse ways for a mouse to go. Cats, for example, aren't known for being quick.
Careful there buddy, T.Rex may not want to be done. Did you take her to dinner first?
Maybe the mouse got batted into the pond by a cat. Who then watched it drown, sad about losing her toy.
Well, color me amazed!

I find it fascinating that one of the animals we do significant medical testing on due to their similarity of internal functions and biology has now been found - and it's literally an entire order of magnitude older than the most ancient human remains we have found. Why do Medical Researchers Use Mice? Hmm.. *scratches head* Very interesting..

T Rex with fur, that would be news. T Rex with feathers, on the other hand... Baby T. Rex Was an Adorable Ball of Fluff
Awesome.
Super cool. I can't wait to find out what other prehistoric animals looked like.
At the moment the whole field seems to me a bit like the Hindu story of the blind wise men trying to understand an elephant and all feeling different bits of it. Palaeontologists find part of one skeleton and mark it as a possible ancestor, but the chance of finding remains is so small and the area to investigate so vast that they have no way of knowing that not that far away is a filled in cave with a lot more data on a closely related species. I've lived long enough to have gone from the ""stone age"" starting half a million years ago, to the realisation that stone tool use dates back millions of years, and probably by a fair number of non-homo species. It may be like astronomers, who in the 1940s thought they had more or less worked out how things worked - only to have a series of major discoveries give a very different shape to the Solar System and the known universe.

To be fair, Lucy at 12 years old may be well into adulthood. Edit: Do we have any clues for that? I had assumed not, but I really have no idea.
Age difference. (she's a many millenia older than you) EDIT: If you're into the whole super-cougar/GILF thing then...might not be an issue.
On a serious note, I just find it so frustrating that the most interesting part of the fossil record is so fragmentary. I know this is very anthropocentric, scientifically, humans are not more important to the universe than dinosaurs, but...I would really love to see a transitional fossil between Australopithecus and genus Homo before I die. It would be satisfy my OCD.
Actually it’s necrophilia
Such a grim perspective!
But even if you got that, surely you'd then want a transitional fossil between that and the genus Homo? And if you got that as well it would only create yet another gap you'd want filled. It's transitions all the way down... Unless we get a 100% complete fossil record, which isn't exactly likely.
Yes we can't fill all the gaps, but at least something that was definitely in between, with intermediate or mosaic characteristics, would be good. I guess what I am looking for is something that is definitely too close to Homo to be dismissed as an ""just an anthropoid ape"", but too different to be justified away with ""only the skull is different, the skeleton is almost the identical, it's just another race"". I know neither of those quoted arguments are valid, but there are people out there that hang on to them. I would like to see the expression on their faces when the undeniable transitional fossil is found (with the right age on top of it all).
Well, both chimps and bonobos reach sexual maturity before they're 10 years old..
I wonder how much of the fossil record has been lost to tectonics, where land masses have moved, been subducted or driven underwater.
The larger problem is from carrion eaters (who also tend to consume the bones), microbes in the soil breaking down remains that did get buried, and then natural erosion destroying the few that fossilize before we can find them. Edit: A quick google confirmed that the only subduction zone on the African plate is in the Mediterranean, and beyond the Rift Valley where it's slowly pulling apart there isn't much else happening to the rest of the continent.

This is also very signifcant for the period when the ice had driven humans to the margins, a mainly littoral grazing existence. Coastal erosion and silt deposition could have removed or covered an awful lot of evidence in tens of thousands of years.
Indeed, one of the favourite arguments of Creationists is the lack of continuity in the fossil record. It's almost as if they have a complete lack of understanding of what science is and how it works.
""almost""?
Almost as if they have decided on the conclusion first, then start looking for evidence? -k
From Chimpan A to Chimpan Z, you'll never make A. sediba out of me....
She likes diamonds.
That's only if it's done without her consent.
Oh yes. They have just enough understanding to know why science is a threat to their worldview.
Most of it. Keep in mind that the majority of all fossils are either marine or come from coastal environments. Remains of organisms that lived in upland environments are very, very rare. Even relatively recent fossils like australopithecines are found in areas that were lowlands at the time, where deposition outpaces erosion. Mountain bluebirds and bighorn sheep will probably never leave a trace of their existence in the future's fossil record.
I think it's not so much that they don't or can't understand the scientific process, but rather that admitting their magical sky fairy didn't ""create"" humans 6000 years ago means they'd have to admit that people are just animals and aren't actually special enough for their god to take an interest in them. Then what would they do with their religious-based narcissism?
Throughout my career as a science educator, I have been surprised and dismayed by how frequently such statements about almost anything in science are false.
That would doubtless explain why overall the largely irreligious EU countries have a lower crime rate, murder rate, road accident death rate and number of foreigners killed in wars in recent years than the still highly religious United States, Russian Federation or Mexico.
The article says ""It’s worth mentioning that the first fossil from the ancestor species was older than the first fossil from the descendant species in just one case"". Shouldn't this read ""younger""?
I resemble this remark. Australopithecus Africanus is a good friend of mine.

That is how it is today, and evident how the world is falling apart. Are you one of those people who thinks you have to read some ancient contradictory instructions from a book written by Stone Age goat-herders to figure out the right way to behave? Some of us can conclude that ""murder is wrong"" without needing to refer to some mythical stone tablets. Quote: And it's great you said ""god"" because ""god"" does not exist. Thank you for agreeing. Only God exists. Prove it.
Don't turn that rock over... they will come crawling out....
The phrasing of the first commandment (""you shall have no other gods before me"") strongly implies that the lowercase-g gods exist, but that capital-g God is asking (telling?) the Jews to put a ring on it and stop texting those other gods.
The fact of evolution does not negate morality.
Complete bullshit. There are the most moral people who have never stepped inside church while complete scoundrels shout for everyone to see how 'holy' they are. Sorry, chump, belief in fairies is belief in fairies. How humans behave is no different now than when we first appeared on the savanna.

Nothing is more scary to me than someone who announces that, if it weren't for their belief in God, they'd be cheerfully out there raping, robbing, and murdering people. It means they want to do these things, and rely on an external force to stop them. Guess what, bubba, I'm an atheist, and i have no desire to do any of those things, and feel that people who do need to be punished for it. You don't need a God to have a moral code.
Too late. They always show up on evolution articles. It's like a bad rash.

Ack, pages and pages of creation debate. Allow me to quote Newton's flaming laser sword: ""that what cannot be settled by experiment is not worth debating"" Perhaps move this to ars philosophus.
Yep. The thread is now ruined. Nothing ruins a thread more than a self-righteous fairy believer.
So, what you're saying is that future archaeologists are going to judge us all by the DNA of the people who stick their chewing gum on the bottom of desks like savages or those who just spit it on the sidewalk.
The better question is have they submitted the DNA to ancestry .com and 23 and me to see if they get relation matches. That way we can push their great(x1000) grandchildren for leaving their gum just lying around. /s
Yes, but did their chewing gum lose its flavor on the bedpost over night?
Came here for this. Wasn't disappointed.
TIL that chewing gum has been around in some form for at least 10,000 years.
Future archaeologists will be able to clone the gum-stickers from recovered DNA
We're certainly not going to leave much else in the way of artifacts.
Oddly enough, the gum was traced to a pair of identical twins. They are being referred to as Rig and Lee.
Was it found on the underside of a 10,000 year old desk?
And by our landfill dumps.
I thought ""Kiev"" sounded odd for a Swedish placename. Luckily there's a link to the article, where the site is mentioned as Huseby Klev, with an L. Much better. ""Klev"" is common in placenames in southern Sweden. The word means ""cliff"" of ""cleft"". If you're looking for Kiev you'll have better luck in Ukraine. ""Huseby"", ""Husaby"" and ""Husby"" are also common placenames, which were given to farms that were made royal estates. Last edited by Rombobjörn on Fri May 17, 2019 2:13 pm
Or they make the kids do the chewing because the adults dont have enough teeth left to do it themselves??
I thought that too, at first, but ancient remains have surprisingly good teeth due to their owners not eating processed foods. That's why there are bushels full of ancient teeth even where the bones have turned to dust.
10,000 year old gum Violet Beauregard's breathing intensifies....
Yea - went hunting for Kiev until I referenced the source, too. They indicate on a map that the place is NW of Gothenburg but <shrug> like gum under the desk, it's a mystery.
l1I&i in many digital fonts are far too closely related from a visual identification perspective IMHO. The other one that gets me in my line of work is prn and pm. One codes on orders for evening the other for ""as needed""
Human teeth are still very adapted to our long phase as hunter-gatherers. Remains from these cultures though tend to have stronger attachment points for jaw muscles and include ground-down teeth. They would have used their teeth almost as a third hand throughout their lives. It was the farming cultures (which entered Scandinavia around 6,000 years ago) that used carbohydrate-rich grains to make porridge, and later bread, that wrecked our teeth. Human mouth bacteria (e.g. streptococcus mutans) diligently converts the sugars into biofilm and acid.
Double Bubble only seems 10,000 years old.
Maybe Bazooka Joe can put it in a museum or fund more digs.
How certain can we be that the people chewing on this gum were doing it to make tools rather than medicinal purposes for even for fun?
And means House city/City of Houses.. Yeah sounds dumb enough to be genuinely Swedish.. Love from a neighbour.
Actually, Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus rely on sucrose (a dimer of one fructose and one sucrose moiety) to make the bio-film we call plaque from fructose and the bond energy in sucrose. They then ferment the glucose for energy, producing acid that dissolves tooth enamel. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/me ... cus-mutans. Without the sucrose, less plaque. Honey includes lots of sucrose so hunter-gatherers can be susceptible to tooth decay: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn ... ten-teeth/. So long as dietary sucrose is low, plaque and cavities should be less of an issue, even if the rest of carbohydrates are from starch. Some fruits have significant sucrose levels, but not many were available to Scandanavians 12,000 years ago.
Nope. It's ""village"", not ""city"". We haven't inflated the meaning of ""by"" as much as the dumb Norwegians and Danes have. Or is it that Norwegian and Danish cities are as small as villages? :-Þ At the time, roughly 1000 years ago, it seems that ""by"" meant approximately ""farm"" or ""estate"".

Transphobic scientists. They are only counting chromosomes to determine the sex of the gum chewers. In Canada is mandatory to ask the individual preferred pronouns OR you can go to jail. Interesting times
I too was bugged and went chasing for this ""kiev"" and found Huseby Klev on Orust (an north of Gothenburg). Googling the incorrect phrase turns up a bunch of hits, which kind of sucks, but did also lead me to this insane version of the story on a completely inscrutable site: https://tiool.com/zimbabwe/archaeologic ... hiang-gum/ . Is it some kind of bot re-write of the article, modern art, or mental illness? What is up with the whole site anway? At least I got a chuckle out of the place name ""Hesse-kebab"". I'll leave you with two quotes from the 'article': ""He handled two DNAs and two people using the ancient Chung Gum, Hessala University University, Nijjish Kububa, who lived, worked, and apparently they gumed on the branch of ancient Sweden [..... ... ...] Archaeologists are first linked to the Sculpture of Scandinavian Horny Mill Multan tools and it appears that 10,000 people in Scandinavian have been used in Eastern Europe with a press release of pressure in Europe. .""
Nice to see a real world example of GOAT - GOAT - GOAT - GOAT - GOAT.
My pitch-chewing, no-nonsense ancestors! And yes, it is ""Husby-Klev"".
Close! But it is ""Huseby klev"" and nothing else. Think otherwise? Take it up with Bengt: http://lokholm.se/husaby_klev_orust_raa ... 005_02.pdf or, if you don't trust him, *Riksantikvarieämbetet*
mmmmm…Juicy Fruit
I can't find a place called Huseby-Kiev on a map and I can't figure out what part of Sweden might be ""southwest"" from plains in Russia. West, all of it. South, not so much, unless they came by way of Murmansk.

When I was a kid and my family went on vacation one of the tourist traps sold pine gum. It was the sap of the tree processed somehow and you chewed it sort of like gum but it was denser not bouncy.

Note how many cites in old Danish controlled England also ends in -by, and how the biggest trading city in all of pre-viking age Scandinavia was called Hedeby, and another big one called Visby? So at least in Old Norse it had the same meaning as in modern Danish and Norwegian. Though of course cities were a lot smaller back then. So something qualifying as a small city 1000 years ago in Scandinavia would barely be a village today.

[quote= And those are our ancestors. It's hard to believe any of us made it to today.[/quote] Our ancestors were probably in the raiding party. The ones who survived the encounter.
Grow the hell up. If that's all it takes to ""trigger"" you, you've got issues.
As my wife and I like to say when circumstances like this are observed, ""There's a story there.""
You sir, are obviously not married.
And has never witnessed a female MMA match.
Looks like their home camp was attacked while the men were out foraging their cattle. They got too comfortable thinking no one would attack a camp composed mostly of peaceful women and children. They were wrong.
If they succumbed to disease, they probably wouldn't all have died at the same time. Even if it was something very virulent, they probably have died several days apart, especially considering the sheer number of victims. Add to that the total lack of men in the burial, and warfare seems to be a far more likely explanation, unfortunately.
The men could fled, but the others were taken by surprise and executed with no resistance? Only the prime age adult men, while a teenager boy is also left behind? Not impossible, but you don't need to be particularly charitable to see this as implausible. In fact, you need to be particularly uncharitable to assume it. A more likely scenario that the men were away.
I doubt the sacrifice theory. You wouldn't sacrifice so many of varying ages and women of child bearing ability. This many people were pretty much the bulk of the non-adult male individuals.
The men were probably away doing the same thing to another group.
There is also the possibility that most of the males were killed in the field, then the females and children in the village were executed. Those 2 or 3 surviving males returned to bury their families. edit: The men in the field would have bodies scattered about and just not found yet.
Damn that's dark and plausible
There are far more recent and far more terrifying mass graves in Poland. The cavemen got nothing on us.
You have obviously not seen a Mom protecting her kids. Given the remains, I guessing these folks surrendered expecting a better outcome than they got. Moms tend to be pretty feroicious protecting their kids.
They weren't cave people. In fact, this is around the time that the racial makeup of Europe began to solidify into what it is today. In some sense, it's really just two instances of the same ugly tradition that goes back to the earliest epochs of modern human technology.
I love these articles!
That skull on the right is set in a rictus of agony. Truly horrific to realize how savage humanity has always been.
PSA: don't feed the fucking trolls.
What's interesting is that that is almost certainly literally true. With that many generations in between, anyone then who had children is basically guaranteed to be the direct ancestor of anyone reading this. What were you up to, grandpa?
The skull is not in ""a rictus of agony"". That is the way decomposition works, and all skulls end up looking that way. I believe that funeral homes prevent that from happening today by sewing the mouth shut or something like that.
Yeah we wouldn't want the surviving relatives to see the true horror of death.
I skimmed the source article was surprised at the number of marraige-age (for a lack of better term) females in the grave. My understanding Bronze Age raids is that goals were usually cows and women (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Táin_Bó_Cúailnge and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_ ... bine_Women for respectively for mythologized examples of such behavior). Perhaps this tribe had done something similar in the past and this was the result of a revenge raid.
This. Each of us is the product of a very long line of folks who were successful in their era. No doubt very few of our distant ancestors were saints or conscientious objectors.
""maybe they fled"" is nonsense... In what circumstances would they be segregated such that they, to the man, are alerted and can flee, but the women and children can't?
Both your examples are iron age not bronze age.
It is unlikely, but within the realm of possibility. It's also possible that they were captured, as well, permitted to bury their dead by the conquering party, and then murdered separately before disposal in an as-yet undiscovered second burial site. There is no limit on the imaginative depths to which human cruelty can descend. This burial site is a single tiny porthole window into the past.
Agree. Any scientific hypothesis must include all possibilities no matter how probable. That they fled is unlikely but within possibilities.
Whenever I read an article about archaeology, I think back to something from my junior high days. In a social studies class, we had to listen to a record, (yes, one of those flat, round black grooved things!), called ""Land of the We-Uns"". It was a sort of play that depicted some archaeologists in the distant future digging in the ruins of Washington, DC. They dug up some fairly common items, totally misinterpreted them, (a Barbie doll was a kind of religious icon was what they concluded from finding a number of them), and they thought that America was called ""We"", because they found a copy of the Constitution that said ""We the People"". It was a good cautionary tale about archaeological evidence and how we interpret it. We can speculate a lot about what happened to the people found in this mass grave, but we need to be aware that we could be totally wrong in our interpretations.
C'mon, man. Speculating is what comment forums are for.
True, speculation is a lot of fun, but I just wanted to point out that we could all be completely wrong. Not as if archaeology is bereft of those kinds of examples.
Oh, I agree. I was being a bit facetious since 90% of comments are speculation. I try to avoid doing it and let the facts speak for themselves. However, people love What If World and the means (forums) to visit there.
This echos the modern David Reich allegedly DNA based narrative. And indeed a quick search reveals that Allentoft and Johannsen's names frequently appear together with Reich's in papers. For example, according to Reich's narrative, the creators of Stonehenge were completely exterminated, and no genetic trace of them remains. Stonehenge was a great cultural achievement with practical benefits - it would have allowed marking the solar calendar to the day, enabling accurate timing for the planting of crops - pretty amazing considering even the Romans didn't match that. (There are no written records that it was used for that, but it seems likely). However, according to Reich, there was no genetic merging or fusion of genes, only elimination of one groups genes. If you are interested in reading objective third party assessment of Reich's work, I recommend reading ""Is Ancient DNA Research Revealing New Truths — or Falling Into Old Traps?"", Gideon Lewis-Kraus, Jan 17, 2019, New York Times. An excellent critique of Reich's work by an intelligent, unbiased, and through journalist who does a good job of explaining all the Reich's results from Reich's perspective, and then, from ""Part II"", carefully examining the foundations of Reich's claims. To summarize the criticism, there are presently just a few interconnected labs in the Reich faction which dominate the field with guarded DNA analysis techniques, access to publishing, a monopoly on funding, and a storyline guaranteed to attract public attention. This is not amenable situation for the scientific method which requires competing factions with the ability to cross check results. It's only been a decade since ""paleogenomics"" has become available as a tool for the study of prehistory. And prehistory is a pretty academic field with few practical engineering applications, while at the same being of great popular interest, so there's little hard feedback from being wrong (no planes will crash, no wars lost), and great incentive to put out a resonant human interest story. Over time more independent analyses will hopefully be performed, and reliability will be enhanced. Patience is required.
Wow, this should be a promoted comment. I was unaware how insular this raft of new studies is. Hopefully the nascent movement towards free publishing and cheaper sequencing breaks the hold of this small group. I am sure there are plenty of alternative viewpoints not even being considered right now.
The shamans of the past sure treated these plants and the effects they have with more respect than we seem to hold for them. We may be more technologically advanced than the ancient peoples, but it seems that the more we did into history the more we could stand to learn ourselves.
I have so many questions about the fox nose pouch.
Anyone else read the title as   ?
The use of the term cocaine is a little exaggerated, cocaine alkaloid in coca leafs is less than 1%, and takes a chemical process to extract it. Yes, I'm fun at parties Edit: Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca?wprov=sfla1 Last edited by andresteare on Mon May 06, 2019 2:39 pm
A bunch of coca leaves, some psilocybin containing mushrooms and a three day fast and the triple fox nose will make perfect sense. You gotta be there.
To be fair, ayahuasca itself isn't really used recreationally even today. From what I have read it is fairly unpleasant to do, since it causes extreme nausea and vomiting. People going to shaman's in Peru to take ayahuasca has become relatively popular, but from what I understand it is more ritualistic (and maybe somewhat like what this ancient shaman practiced).
From what I know, foxes were seen as deceivers and liars for the people at the time; it may be that the pouch was used to house the psychotropics so that the spirits of the foxes, would be on hand to help the shaman to distinguish what visions were real, and which were false, perhaps. It may have been they hoped the foxes would warn them when they were lied to by the spirits as they'd have intimate knowledge of deception and would be able to see false dreams for what they were.
I'm not so sure it's an either/or there. It could well be both. Native Americans had a long list of herbs for various things, both medicinal and ritualistic. The Shaman is traditionally a role part religious, part physician in many cultures. It may be that some things were exclusive to ritual and never used in medicine, and others were used in medicine, but not in ritual. If it had a dual purpose, it might have been used in both. I'd doubt that there was exclusivity in their use if they had a dual purpose. Were I to guess, I'd say most of the time their herbs were for medicines, and only some of the time for rituals. That's mostly because most herbs have some kind of medicinal quality, while few have mind-altering qualities, and you'd PROBABLY keep the ""best kind"" (most ""effective"") with you and forage for anything else you might need for a particular issue. So it's likely these herbs had the greatest utility for a shaman, if they kept them with them. If the Shaman was more of a spiritual figure in their culture and not a healer, then they'd be used exclusively in ritual and the dual purpose herbs may have been for personal use. If the Shaman was a healer, then the mind-altering drug may have been for personal rituals while the rest was for healing/medicine. If the Shaman was a little of both, then it's likely the herbs were used for both ritual and healing, though not necessarily at the same time. Which means, of course, we can't be sure - yet. Knowing more about the Shaman's role in that tribe would be needed to put the shaman having those in more context. If that's clarified, while certainty isn't always possible, it could help clarify the likelihood of how and when those herbs were utilized. The significance and context of fox snouts to hold the herbs might be a clue there.
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
... only on Ars Technica (Actually, yes. And I thought WTF!)
I wonder if the shamans or their patients made that distinction, or saw the two as interdependent.
So they had the Hippocratic Oath? First do no harmine.....
In a certain sense psilocybin and others like it could be construed as root kits for the brain.....
It is the Western Hemisphere's equivalent of the Sumerian Nam Shub Of Enki
So much can be learned from this, for years to come. The wool ties are in amazing condition for being 1000 years old. I'd like to see a full photo of the headband design as well. Wonderful find.
That's still better than most of the ""coke"" people are snorting these days.
Sure they were. They were taking time away from farming, manufacturing, arts, or other useful endeavors. Religion (or whatever you want to call it) is inherently a recreational activity.
I was thinking the same thing, and that the difference is probably in the dose. (Small dose for medicine, large dose for rituals).
If it has a medical use like Cocoa leaf then you can assume it was used as a medicine. Hallucinogens not so much.
""Health Practitioners"" in non-western cultures (priests, shamans, etc) do not distinguish between body health and mind health. It could easily have been part of a ritual healing process. Thus medical. So you can assume it was used as a medicine. Whilst coca is used as a ""medicine"" daily by millions of locals throughout the Andes region to help them deal with altitude issues.
Indeed. Since cultures the world over assumed illness-and other bad stuff- was caused by supernatural intervention, 'medicines' could relieve pain and other symptoms such as swelling, while hallucinogens were believed to be a conduit to the spirit world. Even alcohol intoxication was considered a bridge to the spirit world. Medicating and contacting spirits were overlapping the same concept.
Agreed. After the day I have had, when I get home I'll need to contact the spirit of Johnny Walker.....

Prepared to argue, I'd forgotten that bufotenin could come from sources other than dog killing cane toads (Bufo marinus). Some species of Amanita mushrooms and some relatives of the Yopo tree can apparently produce the same psychedelic molecule. Some Amazonian tree frogs secrete the same toxin as does the rare Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius) indigenous to the northern Sonoran desert. The following comes from some notes on psychoactive alkaloids I scribbled down several years ago: “Bufotenin is said to create a psychedelic effect similar to that of mescaline or LSD, with vivid visual hallucinations. It differs by being very fast acting and by having a short duration of action. Bufotenin from the toad is accompanied by cardiac glycosides which create chest pains and interrupt blood circulation. The drug can be smoked as dried secretion from the toad's parotoid glands, smoked as dried toad skins or consumed orally simply by licking the toad. Taken orally bufotenin is considered to be an aphrodisiac in some circles...............It has been used as an arrow poison and strangely, Bufotenin shows up in the urine of individuals with certain mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.
Wow, that’s interesting that Bufotenin shows up in the urine of schizophrenics. I’d never heard that before, but I found studies supporting the statement. The existence of a hallucinatory agent in the bloodstream certainly suggests a potential causative mechanism for a disease characterized by losing touch with reality. (Hardly conclusive, of course. Don’t want to overstate the point.)
Quote: ""One compound, harmine, points to a plant called ayahuasca."" Although concoctions called “Ayahuasca” can vary significantly depending upon the region of South America in which they are consumed, the cooked beverages are generally made by joining at least two separate and unpretentious plants that would not be considered particularly psychoactive when consumed alone. Both DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) and the similar 5-MeO-DMT (5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine) might be brewed into ayahuasca and both are found in a wide variety of plants. DMT like this must be smoked or injected before it will elicit a psychedelic effect because DMT has almost no effect when taken orally. It is only when unpretentious harmala alkaloids (like harmine and tetrahydroharmine – usually from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine) are boiled into a tea along with a source of DMT – that the DMT escapes destruction in the digestive tract and can pass into the bloodstream.
I do have to say I love that kind of posts on ars!
Interestingly, both harmine and tetrahydroharmine are MAOIs (which is how they inhibit the digestion of DMT). MAOIs tend to also act as anti-depressants. Tetrahydroharmine also exhibits additional activity as a mild SSRI, another class of anti-depressants. While any anti-depressant effect would almost certainly be less obvious to a user than the immediate psychedelic effects of the DMT, one wonders if an anti-depressant effect might not have provided a longer term (days/weeks) beneficial effect to some users. Especially since traditional shamanic formulations do not always contain DMT, depending on the specific ceremony being performed. One also wonders if the combination of all three of the psychedelic, MAOI and SSRI activity might be beneficial as an anti-depressant, as some hallucinogens without MAOIs or SSRIs mixed in have shown some efficacy against depression, also. Basically, I'm wondering if ancient South American shamans might have developed an anti-depressant treatment that modern science dismisses as ""merely"" a psychedelic used in a religious ceremony. EDIT: And, interestingly, not just an anti-depressant treatment. But an anti-depressant cocktail consisting of different active ingredients acting through different pathways. Considering depression is rather resistant to one-size-fits-all drug treatments, it's fascinating to think about the possibility of the shamans inadvertently tackling the issue through a cocktail active on such different pathways. (I say inadvertently only in that they wouldn't have had an understanding of the underlying pathways. Who knows if they were/weren't looking to improve any anti-depressant activity.)
Turns out I was a only a fox nose away from being a Shaman in university.
This may be a summary of your personal views on religion, but from a sociological/anthropological perspective, this is not a useful distinction to erase.
""Ancient Bolivian ritual kit contains traces of hallucinogens"" As did my weekend ritual kit at UCLA.
I could write a whole essay about that, in fact thinking about it I probably have. This isn't the place for one but, in the context of shamanism there is something to be said. As soon as you included arts in the ""useful endeavours"" you lost the plot. Once you get back before, say, Luther, distinguishing art, religion and even other activities starts to get very difficult. Religion is not theology. Religion is the social activities that bind a society together (from res, thing, and ligio, I bind.) If you like, it's a region of common belief and observance. It has many functions. If you look at the Church calendar, for instance, it's agricultural. It sets the times of sowing and harvest. The Hebrews, with two harvests a year, didn't have that. Direct representational art is comparatively recent; art too is deeply entangled with religion. Religion includes stories that locate a society in what it sees as its place in the world, it's a prescientific endeavour to understand and even to control external reality. You can discuss at length whether shamanism was an important part of mental health provision in those societies; the shaman, who had experiences that we might regard as schizophrenic, was able to help members of their society to work through similar crises. This isn't alternatrive medicine because at the time there was no medicine to be alternative to. In our own society drugs have been seen as having psychiatric use; work continues on LSD, cannabinoids and ecstasy and schizophrenics self-medicate with tobacco and alcohol. The only bit of your sentence that a student of anthropology, or psychology and sociology of religion, might agree with is if you interpret the word ""recreational"" as ""re-creational"". Shamanism seems to have elements of an attempt to re-create the conditions of the supposed origins of society, when the other animals talked and had spiritual wisdom to impart. Just because you're edgy and post-Protestant 21st century doesn't make your view of things valuable. To a degree it's just sociopathic - the idea that things that hold society together have no merit and freedom lies in rejecting the lot. But your own society is still full of religious and magical thinking, and understanding earlier societies may help with fixing our own.
Agreed on all counts. And to expand, even for us edgy, post-Lutheran rational atheists, dismissing religion as recreation means your ability to actually understand a different society runs headlong into a brick wall. I mean, take about a third of my job, which is managing cultural resources on Federal lands. The tribes - 29 of them! - have a relationship with oral history, religion, culture, ancestry, landscapes, and places that often dissolves the boundaries between them. The stories they still tell about places they went have deep spiritual and ancestral resonance to them, and the integrity of the landscape I manage is just as important to them as the old flint-knapping site over by the seasonal drainage. They don't give a shit if we preserve the mano and metate in a curation facility, if the landscape context we found it in is modified beyond recognition. And I am obligated, by law, to consult with them on projects, hear their feedback, and understand their point of view. In this case, there's a meaningful and informative distinction between ""shit they did for for fun or to trip balls in their spare time"" and ""religious rituals with deep resonances in their culture, cosmology, mental and physical health, life milestones, and even agriculture and technology."" They didn't recognize the distinction. It was literally unimaginable to become an adult without taking ayahuasca. The distinction is not applicable here.
Completely agree, envy you your job! I would class myself as a fairly rational atheist. I look at the importance of religion in society, and then decide it needs proper, objective study and neither blind belief nor name calling.
The Ayahuasca experience (at a reasonable dose) is like going through 9 hells, at least for those who haven't been taking it all their lives. Then afterwards you feel really chilled for the next few days. Now whether you feel good because of the antidepressant as you suggest, or merely because real life seems so much better than all those terrible things you experienced or reexperienced, I'm not sure. Also, to call it a psychedelic is misleading. When you close your eyes, you see stuff. When you open your eyes, the world is still there. It is internal rather than external. (The internal stuff going on may be rather overwhelming, though, so maybe you'd need to make a big effort to focus back on the world, but if you need the toilet or something, you can generally find a way.)
User experiences vary.....
That's not what I've witnessed or experienced so what are you basing that comment on?
Enjoyed the article! You have the text for the two reconstruction pictures flipped .
Interesting stuff. The mandible appears to have the majority of anatomical landmarks I would expect to see on a modern human, and we have great examples of periodontal bone loss, abrasion and potentially even erosion of tooth structure present.
Cool find and a nice write up Kiona. I predict more prehistoric human species will be found in the coming years. I like to envision the evolutionary process genetics takes as somewhat like a delta where the water finds a path, separates, rejoins the main stream, sometimes on those side paths if it is a long enough journey it picks up ""minerals"" (genetic adaptions) that when returned to the stream turn out to be beneficial to the main population. Of course if separated by too long a time or rapid evolutionary change it is no longer possible to rejoin the stream. Some of those will be different species continuing onto their own delta while others will dead end, like water emptying into the Okovango delta.
Just one persnickety biologist observation: we're really unaccustomed to thinking about species this way in relation to humanity, but it's arguable that Neandertals and Denisovans were more like races or cultivars or breeds of humans, rather than other species. We weren't geographically or reproductively isolated from them, and we weren't behaviorally disinclined to mate with them either. They're considered different species by convention, but the biological species concept really draws the line at whether it's possible to successfully reproduce viable offspring. Under that definition, they're not a different species. Coyotes, wolves, and dogs aren't either.
Well said.
Species is a flawed human concept with no corresponding line in actual biology. Its useful from a discussion standpoint but it a decidedly human construct. PS geographic barriers most assuredly did exist.
It would be dependent on learning more from the fossil record, but it's possible the populations were originally geographically isolated until changing conditions allowed overlap. The Denisovans in particular seem to have been adapted to high altitudes, while the Neandertals seem to have been more adapted to cold. Until warming effects allowed our most prominent ancestors to spread to more areas, it seems like there were three isolated polytypic subspecies, and we're the result of interbreeding once those subspecies were able to interact.
It's still a useful concept, even if the lines start blurring when you zoom in too close in the family tree. It's simply scope sensitive, not wrong.
Useful, yes but it has its limitations. A strict definition as any potentially interbreeding population being a species is probably not the most useful type. https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article ... 79/1653163
Article from Jean-Jacques Hublin, with contribution from Dongju Zhang: https://www.sapiens.org/evolution/xiahe-jaw-denisovan/ That's tremendous progress on the knowledge about Denisovans, but this is also the first time I hear about proteome use in archeology. Sounds like a new field is opening, pioneered by a collaborator of Svante Pääbo himself! One question I have in mind, this gene that let humans fare in high altitude, and which is assumed to be inherited from Denisovans, I believe the mechanism at play is introgression (genes passed on from a related species, while the species itself disappears). Mathematically, how can it happen that a species A passes on a few genes to their cousins B, but the resulting population is B with introgressions from A, rather than a new species made of A+B? I realize my question is not well formulated, the crux is that a child has to be 50-50, so for only a small number of genes from pop A to survive (introgress), how many generations would you typically need? --edited last sentence for clarity Last edited by bonob on Wed May 01, 2019 2:57 pm
When it comes to humans one important thing is all extant humans are incredibly similar from a genetic point of view. Calling clearly different lines different species even if they obviously could produce viable offspring with our line makes sense then. Calling them just another ""breed"" or ""race"" (as the differences between extant human populations) would mean to throw out a very useful distinction.
Having no significant biology training, I have what may be a stupid question, but bear with me. The jawbone found tells us that this particular Denisovan was adapted to live at high altitudes, where the environment was difficult, and food scarce. Why would they choose to live in this fairly inhospitable environment? What forced them to forgo living in a warmer place with more food? Was there some other species preventing them from doing so?
Excellent questions! A host of PHd's to be written.....as soon as we find some other evidence of Densiovans. Currently we have this jaw bone and one pinky finger and some very good DNA analysis of each (and their DNA ghosts present in modern humans) as our total evidence that the species even existed. Asking motivation questions is a bit premature at this point....
And the arm or leg bone fragment from the teenaged girl Denisovan/Neandertal 50/50 hybrid.
Thank you both for your responses. I always come away smarter after a session on Ars, (except for times when the thread is infested with trolls).
That's not a very practical definition though. Setting up breeding experiments for implicitly rare newly discovered species before recognition would be difficult in the best of circumstances, and would make any identification of extinct species pretty much impossible.
A legit question, as we have no idea to know what kind of weather/climate they had at the time of their life. We have no observable evidence. We could just use our imagination though, as is common in this kind of dating. Although you could go ask an Eskimo why they prefer life in the arctic instead of moving to warmer clients. I presume you would find a legit answer.
Oh yeah! I had forgotten about that one!

Trolls are the bane of the internet.
I also have no significant background in biology, so maybe this is also a naive question: Do we have enough information about this culture to believe that they were aware of the existence of warmer places with more food? And how to get there? It would seem that a band of Denisovans who had lived in a particular area for a few generations might not have much in the way of a detailed oral history of how they got there.
c.f.
And the fact that modern people in Papua New Guinea share 3%-6% DNA with Denisovans.
You've pretty much answered your own question, if you take into account that the two populations (I won't call them species, since their hybrids are fertile) start out with most (99%? more?) of their DNA in common. Let's take a ballpark 20,000 genes and assume 99% commonality. That's a difference of just 200 genes. A first-generation crossbreed will, on average, have 100 genes traceable to the outgroup. His/her children, 50. In the absence of selection or further cross-breeding (and ignoring linkage), it takes about seven generations, ie, likely less than 140 years, for the average outgroup contribution to be a single gene. By ""linkage"", I mean the fact that some genes are physically located on the same chromosome. They can still get separated through a process called ""crossing-over."" You get around sixty crossing-over events in each human generation, but the odds of two genes being separated by crossing-over depends on their physical distance on the chromosome, plus some factors that are non-uniform across the chromosome. So getting all the way to a single gene is less likely than the calculation above suggests. But luckily, you only asked about getting down to ""a few"" genes. Starting with an average of 100 outgroup genes spread over 23 pairs of chromosomes means 4 outgroup genes per chromosome pair on average, so linkage isn't a big worry.
We have essentially no information about their culture. It's a reasonable guess that they had tools, clothing, jewelry, art, and language. (However, I don't think anyone has found any actual artifacts that can be tied to Denisovans.) We aren't sure what they ate or how far they traveled to find food. What they knew about a wider world is anybody's guess, but I think you're being too dismissive of oral history. If they thought it was important, they could easily remember it for many, many generations. You know that Hawaii or California or etc exists and you even have a really accurate map of how to get there, but that's not the same thing as being willing to leave your family and go there, or being able to convince your whole tribe to go there. In much of human history and geography, harsher environments offer a kind of safety to the people who live there. They live spread out, and enemies may never even find them before dying of cold or thirst or altitude. Meanwhile they often cultivate extensive intelligence about the outside world, since they are dependent on trade (or raiding) for various things they can't make themselves. There are fewer of those dependencies in the stone age, but a good source of flint might be one example. Last edited by nartreb on Wed May 01, 2019 5:58 pm
Likely same as why people lived in inhospitable places a couple centuries ago: it was a life. Some group figured out how to make a go of it and stayed there. Others would have filled other niches.
That, plus the fact that 'race' (when applied to humans, anyway) is an even shakier concept than is 'species'.
That's one of those ""we'll never know"" answers. Reaching that far back in time, the main driving forces were likely following food or avoiding becoming food.
But no evidence of third molars, at least to this lay-person's eyes.
And disease, which imposes strong selection pressures, including for location. If Denisovans at lower altitude were exposed to a burden of disease greater than at altitude, you might see relatively more living higher than you would expect based on other factors.
That's not, in my understanding, a universal view of the definition of a species, though it was at one time common. Other elements of species definition include geographical range; ecological niche occupied; in some cases morphology; and also genetic analysis. Given the age of these specimens, and the limited sample of bones, there's a lot of guesswork involved. But the genetic analysis, as I understand it, suggests that while these species, Denisovans, Neanderthals, and Sapien Sapiens (us), could interbred, they didn't do so routinely. That isolation creates some distinct genetic markers, which I think the researchers are picking up here. Just because two animals can interbred, doesn't make them one species, though it is very suggestive. If the animals bred rarely, occupy different ecological or regional areas, and have distinct genetic attributes, I think you'll find a lot of biologists calling them different species. Input welcome from experts.
Well, also adaptation. These animals apparently had a genetic adaptation to living at high altitude - without necessarily putting genetic cart before behavioral horse, that genetic advantage would increase their competitive fitness at high altitudes -- genetically speaking they were ""good at it."" They may have occupied this ecological niche b/c warmer, dryer areas presented other challenges that were more significant (as you say, ""becoming food"" -- but starving to death is another problem in competitive niches). Also, finding traces of humanoid remains is hard - and cold, dry caves is one great place to do it -- so it may be that we're finding them where they were preserved, which might not be the only place they lived.
""Species"", in the broadest sense, just means ""kind"". Any groups you can distinguish according to any characteristic you like, could in this nontechnical sense be considered separate ""species"". There's a few somewhat different definitions used in different branches of biology. What I consider the basic biological definition is this: Two groups which cannot interbreed are separate species. (More precisely, they cannot produce fertile offspring. So horses and donkeys are separate species, because mules and hinnys are sterile.) This is simple to state, though it's rather impractical for field testing. Note that ""cannot interbreed due to physical distance"" is a valid criterion for separating two species, but biologists will not do so if there is evidence of a genetic connection via a chain of interbreeding, adjacent populations. This gets messy: the population of puma in Florida have been physically isolated for many generations now, and they have had distinct physical adaptations for longer than that. But last I checked they were not considered a species, just a subspecies. Plant biologists routinely separate species that can and sometimes do interbreed; the phenotypic differences are compelling enough that the biologists just ignore their inconvenient promiscuity, especially when the hybrids are rare. (The plants' promiscuity, I mean.) Authorities on bird taxonomy, somewhat analogously, consider some species to be separate even though they can and very frequently do interbreed. Ducks and geese are notorious for this; you are unlikely to find an American Black Duck that does not have mallard ancestors. I honestly have no idea what microbiologists use for a definition of species. Some single-celled organisms do ""conjugate"" (a kind of sex) but many don't, which makes ""interbreeding"" a useless criterion. (To make things even more complicated, ""lateral gene transfer"" between unrelated species (e.g., via viruses) is something that occurs in nature.) Bacteriologists rely on genetic markers (in genes that are believed to be unlikely to be laterally transfered) to firmly identify a species. We now know of a number of (mostly microbial) ""species"" that we can't grow in the lab; we only know they exist thanks to DNA sampling of soil or water. DNA techniques are advancing toward a point where we can sequence genomes and correlate particular genetic differences with likelihood of speciation. In the future biologists in general may rely on such measures as a primary definition. It will be interesting to see how many ""cryptic"" species are revealed - populations that are seemingly identical to known species but genetically isolated enough to qualify as separate species.

IANA biologist, but didn't Neanderthals have significantly bigger brains overall, but smaller forebrain and larger hindbrain? While I agree with your general sentiment, surely the physical differences between Neanderthals and Sapiens was significant enough to be more than what most would call a ""race""? We didn't need DNA evidence to note significant morphological differences. Quote: Under that definition, they're not a different species. Coyotes, wolves, and dogs aren't either. But... they are! We can define ""species"" to match whatever we want the outcomes to be, but coyotes and wolves are clearly different animals, with significant physical and behavioural differences, even if they can interbreed. ""Species"" is a very practical way of distinguishing the two.
I agree geographic isolation's most likely, but geographic isolation isn't required for populations to diverge. It's called sympatric speciation, and Ars taught me about that more than a decade ago

So you have ""swarming kinds"" (describing bats as locusts) and ""swimming kinds"" (describing whales as fish) and ""flying kinds"" (describing bats as birds). Quote: What I consider the basic biological definition is this: Two groups which cannot interbreed are separate species. (More precisely, they cannot produce fertile offspring. So horses and donkeys are separate species, because mules and hinnys are sterile.) But what if a fertile mule was produced? Would that make horses and donkeys the same species? Or does it have happen more than once? I mean, this is why we have ring species where species A and B can interbreed, B and C can interbreed, but A and C can't. The concept of ring species relies on defining A and B as different species, even though they can interbreed. I'm glad I'm not a biologist, and I don't have to regularly deal with this shit. Quote: I honestly have no idea what microbiologists use for a definition of species. I could be wrong, but I understand biologists don't have any hard rules about what a species is, just practical rules of thumb.
""Kind"" is an English word (related to ""kin"") that has nothing to do with religion, except that it was an obvious choice for translations of the same concept from Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. I will point out that the King James version seems pretty clear to me that there were multiple kinds of birds, and multiple kinds of cattle, and multiple kinds or sorts of creeping things, which would magically come to Noah as pairs of males and females. (With spares, in the case of ""clean"" animals, so he could sacrifice some at the end of the flood.) Here's Deuteronomy: Of all clean birds ye shall eat. 12But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 13And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, 14And every raven after his kind, 15And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 16The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 17And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 18And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. There's plenty more like that. There are lots of kinds of birds, all of them fly but only some of them are unclean. Similarly, there are different kinds of beasts, and so forth. It's true that bats are mentioned among the birds. That's a mistake of class, not of species. I think your final sentiment is right. Working biologists generally don't care what the definition of species is, they'll just work within whatever taxonomic framework they're given. It's taxonomists who have to worry about it.
I guess they needed a ... Dentistovan.
You can ask the same question of billions of people alive today. Often the answer is ""because this is my home."" There are a lot of practical reasons why moving away is not a good idea: you know where the food, game, and shelter are, you have a community to share burdens with (hunting, farming, child rearing, making stuff). Then you'd have to convince enough people to go with you into the great unknown where dragons lie. The odds against moving are formidable. It takes a special character and environmental conditions to make moving more appealing than staying put. Last edited by BloodNinja on Wed May 01, 2019 10:39 pm
I work for Festivals, and I could not wait to see someone recreating a so old one, with art, culture, booze (chicha!) in this beautiful place: it could be one of the best experience possible!
""Fortunately, a member of Nash's local excavation crew had an aunt in a remote village who still brewed old-school moye chicha, and she evidently didn't mind showing a group of archaeologists how it was done."" It seems like a bit of a stretch to go from ""old school - this is how they did it when I was a girl"" to ""old school - this is how they did it over a thousand years ago.""
I thought the same thing. On the other hand, while it can't show that they used the same process, ""you can make it in half the time compared with using corn"" seems like a valuable insight.
You just need an instagram account and a few models and celebrities to take pictures of in the Andes, and the money will just start rolling in! Pro tip: you will need to actually plan and put on the festival. Don’t forget the toilets.
No, it isn't much of a stretch. Egyptians, ca. 3000 B.C.E., discovered the basic process for making beer (booze with grains) that we still follow to this day. Take grain > soak it > let it sprout > dry it (collectively known as malting) > soak it in warm water (mashing) > ferment the sugar water. Everything we've done since then basically amounts to process improvements from higher yielding grains with greater diastatic properties (basically, more enzymes for converting starches to sugar), to scaling up the process with steam, electricity, and really big tanks. But the basic process of malt, mash, ferment has been unchanged in at least 5,000 years. Passing down knowledge of how to ferment something for 1,000 years? That's nothing for humans. We've passed down knowledge of how to make the same style of tools for tens of thousands of years. We've passed down knowledge of how to make cave art, in the same cave system, for thousands of years. Frankly, we really fucking love getting lit. Really, really love it. The evidence is tilting heavily in favour of us cultivating grains, not for bread or fried rice, but for getting wasted. It is, literally, one of the easiest things in the world of archaeology to imagine we've more or less faithfully passed down knowledge of how to brew over a relatively short timespan like 1,000 years. I cannot emphasize this enough. We humans love booze. And we are exceptionally clever at making booze out of anything with starch (we can break down starches into sugars with either intensive cooking or enzymes -- see ""malting"") or sugar.
Beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks would have been quite valuable in ancient times because of their antibacterial properties since natural untreated water isnt safe to drink most of the time. Thats why in the Middle east there was a distinction made for wines to mix with water to quench everyday thirst therefore cheaper for the masses, then wine for inebriation and festivities,more expensive. Then there is cooking wine. Also caught a grammar error in the first sentence ""round 1100 CE, they made sure nobody else could enjoy their former home by destroyed the brewery that, for 400 years"" should be ""destroying"".
Actually it was because water wasnt safe to drink back then untreated so a little wine or other alcoholic beverage mixed with water killed enough pathogens to make the water safe to drink. Even little kids drank this to avoid getting diseases. Some of course loved to drink but there were many people who didnt drink to get drunk. In the Ancient Middle East there were different wines for everyday sanitizing of water then cooking wine and finally the expensive good tasting wines for drinking to merriment.
Of course the basic process is the same and of course it has been passed down over the generations. But the article makes a distinction between the way the current generation brews it and the way they brewed it a couple of generations ago. That's the point of the aunt who still does things the ""old school"" way. It's the details that matter in this particular context. And there's no reason I can see to think that the details of how they did it fifty or a hundred years ago are an accurate indicator of the details of how they did it a thousand years ago, and nothing in your comment changes that.
Make mine a Chicha Lite, watching my carbs
I had a chance to visit Cerro Baúl with Nash and Ryan a dozen years ago to shoot a mini documentary video for an exhibit. One thing I found very fascinating is that the ""regional powers"" Ryan mentions here weren't 50 miles away. A significant Tiwanaku settlement was literally on the next hilltop, and they explained to me that the archaeological evidence suggested that the cultures were quite distinct in terms of dress, burial goods, ceremonial items, etc. The Wari may indeed have been the dominant power, and perhaps there was periodic conflict, but they employed an interesting strategy of co-operation and side-by-side co-habitation, facilitated by feasting and revelry. These ""ancients"" could teach us something.
Ehhhhh, the ""booze for clean drinking water"" connection is ... a little off until you reach the absolutely repulsive urban living conditions of the industrial revolution. Untreated well / river / standing water has been the standard for us for a very, very long time. And it still is for about a quarter of us. There have been, in recorded history, relatively few people whose sole method of hydration has been booze [edit] because making booze is energy and labour-intensive [edit]. I may have been flippant about my assertion that we were brewing solely to get lit. If you're drinking young, unfiltered booze, you're likely getting a crapton of B vitamins and easier to digest minerals from the yeast and bacteria slurry you're also chugging, but the primary reason to drink booze for the ancients really does appear to have been getting lit. Or, euphemistically, ""ceremonial us."" Last edited by SomeRandomGuy on Wed May 01, 2019 7:20 am

...I smell a fad ready to descend upon Brooklyn and other parts of NYC. Authentic artisanal gluten-free chicha, made using traditional methods, only $20 a glass, follow us on Instagram! Definitely need to try this when I hopefully visit Machu Pichu or just Central / South America in general.
If you're going to claim someone else is factually incorrect, it's helpful to cite support for that claim. I believe it's you who are repeating myth and are factually incorrect, based on numerous sources like this one: https://leslefts.blogspot.com/2013/11/t ... -myth.html ""Not only are there specific – and very casual – mentions of people drinking water all through the Medieval era, but there seems to be no evidence that they thought of it as unhealthy except when (as today) it overtly appeared so. ""
Heh, ""relatively few people whose sole method of hydration has been booze."" Medieval Europeans are a relatively small number of people. I know the history, that's why I had the weasel sentence in my post. [edit] And, honestly, we were talking about ancient developments in the boozy arts. My point that we originally developed booze mostly to pursue ""ceremonial uses"" is, I believe, still standing even with your knockout argument about ""medieval Europe.""

Ferment how? Any random yeast or bacteria that falls into it?
""an empire that spanned over 1,300km (808 mils)"" 1300 km is about 51,181,000,000 mils.
Out of a world population of ~360 million. And it's unclear how many of those medieval Europeans would have used booze as their sole form of hydration. Yeah, about 1/5 of humanity extant at the time is relatively few.
I'm going to say that this isn't within the mass spectrometer, but instead it must be a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) where the high temperature is produced in the plasma. The thing about this though is that as per the article the molecular bonds do break down. It gives you a great survey of the atoms present, but almost zero information about what molecules were present. Following the link, they used direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) to do the work out where they determined what residues were present and hence how the beverage was made. The 9,000⁰C stuff was just to work out where the clay that the vessel was made from came from. Maybe it doesn't matter, but the direct quote immediately afterwards reflects the DART-MS work, not the LA-ICP-MS work that singled out by the article.
That is a very complicated question. Clearly, ""let 'er rip"" has been a thing since antiquity, and is still practiced by some lambic breweries and anyone with a wide open coolship. But ... it's not hard to take the slurry of yeast and bacteria from a good batch of beer and use it to kickstart the next batch. Or even just getting the next batch of wort into the ""special vessel"" where a nice blend of yeast and bacteria has taken hold. We've likely been doing that since we've been making booze. And repitching yeast (from, usually, a pure culture) is the way we still do things commercially.
I live in Peru, and we drink Chicha de Jora whenever it's available at a restaurant (the children too) -- that's corn chicha with jora seeds, and only very mildly alcoholic. Plain corn chicha I've only tried a few times. Someone invited me to drink it once when I was out walking in the Sacred Valley, and the effect was weird, quite floaty, like I was bouncing all the way home. With all this talk of hydration, I think people are forgetting that chicha is also essentially a liquid food. In Peru there is a tradition of boiling up all kinds of strange powders (ground beans, maca, grains, seeds, etc) to make very sustaining hot drinks.
Surely boiling would be quicker, easier and more effective, or did they not know about it?
More likely LA. They're apparently a popular ornamental in SoCal. Unfortunately, I see no one selling whole berries online so this particular experiment will remain hypothetical for me.
And I bet it tastes pretty good - mead-like, with sweet, peppery floral notes from the pepper berries? I'd quaff that!
Yeah if you really want to make sure you have a pretty pure colony you probably could use a procedure like the one we still use to make sourdough today: take some berries and mix them with water, wait 24-48h, make a new mixture and transfer some of the old one into it. If you repeat this and once more you get a pretty homogeneous yeast and lactobacterial colonization (ie the microorganisms that grow best in there) that you can work with. Just add this mix to a large mix of berries and water and you are set to brew. You could try and dry some of the starter mixture if you need to use it later, but the yeast and bacteria will slowly die with time so you probably shouldn’t use it after 3 or 4 months or so... The only problem I see is that the woman nowadays heats up the berries which would kill all the yeasts and bacteria that are on the surface of the berries so that step probably needs to be adapted.
5k? Much older than that. Pottery that is around 13k years old has been found with beer residue, and since it was occasionally brewed in stumps and the like it's very probably older than that. Hell, there's rules and procedures about beer in the Code of Hammurabi, as well various other places (up to and including prayers). As for ""Hold my beer"", I suspect some variation was grunted out by the very first hominid who discovered inebriation. Wouldn't surprise me if most mammoth hunting parties and the like got ritually buzzed beforehand. (You know, so as to face down a multiton animal using only a burnt stick.)

There's absolutely nothing I do that would be fundamentally unfamiliar to an Egyptian or a Wari priestess. You boil some yummy stuff in water until the sugar and flavor is infused in the water, you slop in the dregs of the last batch or leave it open to the air for a day or so, you let it sit in a vessel for a couple days or weeks while it foams and burbles a bit, you drink it and get happy. They'd be really impressed with my stainless stock pot and glass carboy and gas burners, being used to ceramic pots and an open fire, but there is nothing about my Saturday afternoon that would look unfamiliar to them. And I bet they could shoulder me aside and make some chicha in the same equipment if I taught them how to light the gas burner. SomeRandomGuy wrote: Frankly, we really fucking love getting lit.

Especially when the process of making stuff to get us lit is really simple. There is no reason at all why that recipe and approach would have changed in 1000 years. I mean, over time, maybe proportions vary a little, maybe they use a gas flame rather than a fire, but it's basically impossible to improve the basic process of brewing, and changing it would probably result in failure.
Since they were using porous ceramic pots, I imagine your special vessel hypothesis has some merit. And like you said, if for some reason that failed, every batch leaves goo behind in the fermenter; they needn't understand the microbiology of yeast to understand that inoculating the wort with it made things happen. There's no reason for anyone to imagine they were any less savvy about brewing than your average modern brewmaster. They clearly produced this stuff in volume.
Not sure about beer however when making mead (honey wine) they dissolved the honey in water then put it in a pot and covered the pot with cheese cloth and put it outside. Eventually, if lucky, the right yeast ended up in the pot and started munching on the sugar, converting it to alcohol as a byproduct. If you haven't tried mead, you should. It's absolutely delicious! You can't taste the alcohol in it, so be careful.
Considering pathogens weren't discovered until relatively recently, they may just end up with anecdotal evidence that people that drank from certain wells or rivers got sickly, and those that drank liquids that are boiled as part of their preparation did not. Which is the real reason the beer would be safer to drink, if it wasn't later adulterated - the preparation of the wort requires boiling the grains - this would have been the boiling step that killed the pathogens in the water - but the same would have been true of preparing soup or tea.
First of all, alewives brewed for commercial sale to make income. They didn't produce it as a substitute for drinking water for the home. Second making enough of it to stay hydrated would have consumed an entire household's day in labor every single day. Even with modern conveniences and advanced, specialized tools, it takes me and a buddy 12 hours of work to make and clean up after 20 gallons made in four batches. The complications of gathering the massive amount of firewood and the incredibly primitive tools make this entire ""beer was used instead of water"" thing absurd. Third, and most significant: beer dehydrates you! Ethanol is a diuretic. I suppose if ""beer"" were <1% alcohol this problem wouldn't show up, but at that point any preservative effects of ethanol are nonexistent. Not only that, but medieval gruit ales (so, anything before the 13th century at the earliest, 15th for late adopting regions) had poor antimicrobial properties compared to hopped beers. Not to mention, if beer consumption were that totally dominant over water, every child would have been born with fetal alcohol syndrome. We can be sure they drank a lot of it. Beer does carry nutrients and ""store"" grains that would otherwise spoil effectively, but the idea that people would substitute it entirely in place of water is just ridiculous.

Sounds more hygienic than the corn version. Traditionally, you chew the mush then spit it into the pot. You need the enzymes in your saliva to break down the starch in the corn.

This is not all that surprising. The local population was quite mixed, and quite possibly not majority Muslim as the conversion rate to Islam was quite slow. According to a book published in 2014 by Gideon Avni, the population was still majority Christian around the time that the Crusaders arrived. The Muslims had come in as foreign overlords and the population had not converted all that quickly. Indeed one Muslim historian quoted by Avni, al-Muqaddasi in c.965 (more than 300 years after the conquest of Jerusalem in 637) wrote: ""few are the learned here, many are the Christians, and these make themselves distasteful in the public places... The Christians and the Jews are predominant here and the mosque devoid of congregations and assemblies."" Quoting the description of the book (The Byzantine Islamic Transition in Palestine): ""Using a comprehensive evaluation of recent archaeological findings, Avni addresses the transformation of local societies in Palestine and Jordan between the sixth and eleventh centuries AD. Arguing that these archaeological findings provide a reliable, though complex, picture, Avni illustrates how the Byzantine-Islamic transition was a much slower and gradual process than previously thought, and that it involved regional variability, different types of populations, and diverse settlement patterns. Based on the results of hundreds of excavations, including Avni's own surveys and excavations in the Negev, Beth Guvrin, Jerusalem, and Ramla, the volume reconstructs patterns of continuity and change in settlements during this turbulent period, evaluating the process of change in a dynamic multicultural society and showing that the coming of Islam had no direct effect on settlement patterns and material culture of the local population. The change in settlement, stemming from internal processes rather than from external political powers, culminated gradually during the Early Islamic period. However, the process of Islamization was slow, and by the eve of the Crusader period Christianity still had an overwhelming majority in Palestine and Jordan."" Edit:formatting
The Unsullied
No need to go there. These people could easily have been the product of inter-marriage. There were plenty of Anglo-Indians from the time of the East India company and the Raj through intermarriage, and I would expect that a number of them served in the military too.
Quote: But although hundreds of thousands of Europeans fought and settled in the Levant from 1095 to 1291, there's no trace of European ancestry in the genomes of the people living in Lebanon today. Quote: Haber and his colleagues suggest that the interaction between groups during the Crusades didn't last long enough or happen at a large enough scale to leave a genetic trace 800 years later. Suggest? That sounds a bit speculative. The lack of genetic trace could easily have been the result of something else rather common. A little bit of genocide could go a long way. It doesn't seem implausible that someone came along and decided to do away with the most visible infidels.
Genetic cleansing? More likely mere dilution after the Europeans left. I don't think the Muslims had an intentional plan of eliminating European genetic stock...
From what little evidence we have, genocide seems less common in the Middle Ages. This post has some interesting thoughts on the matter: https://magistraetmater.wordpress.com/2 ... es2334783/ Also, religious genocide isn't how Muslims traditionally treated land they took over. Frequently a new ruler would come in and take over a population of a different religion, and slowly convince people to convert through taxes, etc. You can see this ""tolerance"" in the way Muslims in Spain acted towards the Spanish, and the way the Spanish acted in return. The leaders of population changed and the population slowly converted. Knights would go back and forth between kingdoms, like El Cid, who worked for a Muslim king for a while. It's certainly possible that the Crusades hardened them, but you would need some serious primary source evidence to assume that's what happened.
Conversion was the approach to some extent, but ""death to infidels"" and killing of apostates has been in place for a long time in some areas. The crusades were hard fought on both sides and ended with a decisive outcome. Conversions don't change DNA; this article shows that the existant diversity went away - by examining a mass grave near the end of the crusades. Atrocities are not a modern invention.
This is hardly new; My university textbook from the 1990s (""The Crusades"" 2nd Edition, by Hans Ebhard Meyer) already detailed how the the local populations intermarried, and much of the history of Outremer (something began and sustained by Crusaders from across Christendom) is based around constantly shifting alliances between Crusader states, individual Lordships and Kingships, different Knights Orders, different sects and factions of Islam, Byzantium, people fleeing from the Mongols and then eventually the Mongols themselves who crush everyone... It would be astounding if there wasn't a wild genetic diversity in the people fighting in that time. Indeed, Louis IX's own crusade, the 7th and targeted against Egypt only succeeded at first (before heading to complete disaster and surrender) because Egypt was already fighting a local and sectarian war against someone else...
The Izitis were pretty much wiped out in areas controlled by ISIS. They were unique in the area as a distinct population that hung onto their religion in an area contolled by Islam (with small interludes) for over a thousand years. In a few short years, they were wiped out by a multiracial group when faced with forced converaions or death. They knew what was coming, yet did not convert. Result: no more Iziti people in that area. There are many examples of religious wars pitting different populations against each other, where at least one side refuses to assimilate, even faced with death. Even if the motivation is religious conversion, the result is indistinguishable from ethnic clensing.
Unfortunately we do have to confirm it, because some people don't believe it for political reasons. Look at the complaints when the BBC had a black Roman soldier in the north of England, even though that is entirely historically accurate. Having this kind of evidence nicely undermines the historical revisionists and white supremacists, as well as the notion of race itself.
That's putting it very politely.
Religious genocide is exactly how early Muslims behaved. Muslims invaders are actually the ones that came up with the yellow badge to identify “filthy Jews” they subjugated. Hitler later copied their practice. They allowed “People of the Book”, or Christians and Jews to live as second-class citizens. Other infidels were slaughtered. Dhimmis were second-class citizens who paid high taxes, and the jizya, or protection fee often in publicly humiliating ceremonies. They said conversion couldn’t be forced, but by treating dhimmis as lower class, it was quite an incentive to convert in areas they conquered.
Non-muslims were very much second cases citizens in Spain during that time. It would net be considered ""tolerance"" by today's standards. Just some of the rules the non-muslims had to follow: acknowledged Islamic superiority accepted Islamic power paid a tax called Jizya to the Muslim rulers and sometimes paid higher rates of other taxes avoided blasphemy did not try to convert Muslims complied with the rules laid down by the authorities. These included: restrictions on clothing and the need to wear a special badge restrictions on building synagogues and churches not allowed to carry weapons could not receive an inheritance from a Muslim could not bequeath anything to a Muslim could not own a Muslim slave a dhimmi man could not marry a Muslim woman (but the reverse was acceptable) a dhimmi could not give evidence in an Islamic court dhimmis would get lower compensation than Muslims for the same injury

Even if the motivation is religious conversion, the result is indistinguishable from ethnic clensing. You’re attributing modern thinking and behaviour to medieval populations. There are lots of instances where Christians could live in peace in Muslim kingdoms, as long as they paid taxes. It makes complete sense: when you conquer a land, having it unused because you killed everyone is not very sensible, and leads to you losing that land because you don’t have an army to defend it. ISIS really is an anomaly, with its army and population increased by immigration.
That is not in contradiction with what they wrote (i.e. genocide was not common). Incidentally, these rules are not too dissimilar to those the Jews had to live under in Christian Western Europe.
They were still rather dissimilar; Jews were more free to practice their religion under Muslim rule than they were under Christian rule. Muslims were more tolerant of Jews than Christians were and made more space for them in law and society than Christians did. Christians meanwhile scapegoated Jews for everything bad that happened, exiled them, and often killed them more often than Muslims did. Hell, there's a pretty big overlap between the period of Moorish rule in Spain and the period of the Jewish golden age in Spain, and a big factor in that is the lack of authoritative Christian antisemitism.
Yes indeed you would, need serious primary source evidence to assume that's what happened, and I'm not saying that. But I am saying that from the way it is presented in the article, it sounds like the opposite might be happening: assuming it was caused by dilution, without serious primary source evidence. My point is that it there are multiple plausible theories, and their ""suggest"" sounds like they might be presuming the cause of the disappearance without adequate evidence themselves. edit: -> dilution wording Last edited by AreWeThereYeti on Mon Apr 22, 2019 1:32 pm

Right. It also changed depending on time and location. My point was religious freedom was not significantly worse under medieval Muslim kings compared to medieval Christian kings. Not that either were ideal...
Just like any long running war, there will be instances of every behaviour imaginable taking place somewhere, somewhen, that will include attempted genocides by many groups against many other groups, I would expect that any remains found could be shown to suggest evidence to back almost any opoinion or argument anyone wants to put forward.. Look at what has happened elsewhere at other times, in times of conflict, anything goes, there is always someone willing to go the extra mile to inflict inhumane acts against others, happened then, has happened since, is happening today and it will happen into the future, its a part of humanity..
Oh no, not worse at all, agreed. Noticeably better for the most part. In Spain it was only at the decline of Moorish rule and the re-invasion by subsequently more fundamentalist groups that things got worse for non-Muslims. A big lesson in this case that remains relevant today being ""fundamentalism is harmful.""
Or Christians in Japan during the 1600s-1868. Religious zealotry is wack.
a mass grave isn't something I'd read too much into. nothing says they didn't just clear a battle site and dump all bodies (from both sides) into a pit to avoid disease/smell/etc. or that some were simply mercenaries.
Why is this ""surprising""? That was the standard for military forces well into the modern age, it was still occurring to a limited extent in WW2 and even Vietnam. This sounds like an exercise in using new technology to confirm on old, known condition.

Ethnic cleansing in modern times is wholly different than ethnic cleansing at the time of the Crusades. Aside from individual soldiers - who likely were attacked more for who they fought for rather than their ethnicity - I'd like to see evidence of any true ""ethnic cleansing"", especially since given the significantly smaller population at the time, anyone of European descent captured would likely be enslaved, rather than outright killed.
Muslims made all non-Muslims wear badges. Christian's subseqently modified that to apply to Jews. But then again, there's a logical fallacy: what's the point of making anyone wear badges if the idea was to kill them all (religious genocide)? Why not just kill them rather than mark them? The use of badges spanned centuries, which suggests that any Muslim genocide (if it existed on a routine basis) was very inefficient.
""European soldiers sometimes married local women and raised children, some of whom may have grown up to fight in later campaigns."" I just MUST ask about this line. HOW DO THEY DETERMINE MARRIAGE FROM DNA? Marriage is a human social/religious/legal agreement that has no record in DNA. It seems to me that all you can tell from DNA is that they interbred, not intermarried? What is their methodology for determining marriage? Put another way, how do we know the offspring aren't the results of other breeding patterns, such as systematic rape, prostitution, or simple human promiscuity, instead of intermarriage? Edit: I don't really care about downvotes per se, as I view them as ultimately meaningless, but I'm actually curious what about this comment rates downvotes? It's a serious question about how the researches came to that conclusion, because the article doesn't do a good job of supporting the stated conclusion. Last edited by Jeff S on Mon Apr 22, 2019 10:42 am
Yes, we always knew that the Crusaders married and interbred (also interbred without marrying) with the local populace. The children often became soldiers as well. The reality behind the Crusades is that there were never enough troops to defend the territory and they often recruited from both native-born and mixed-race males.
My guess is that’s easier to recruit from the healthy legitimate sons of your soldiers than from the unwanted children of war widows. Anyway, and I don’t know why, there is something tiresome in your assumption that it all started with rape, as much as in other assumptions made here it all ended in ethnic cleansing. I know Crusades were no parties, but still.
I'm not assuming there's any rape at all. I listed multiple possibilities. I'm not a historian, I don't know if there was or wasn't much rape during the crusade. I know enough about history though, to know that armies sometimes do rape as they invade other lands. I'm just asking about methodology. It may be there is non-genetic historical evidence for marriage, that can then be supported by genetic evidence of interbreeding, I just don't understand how you can get directly from genetics to marriage, since marriage is a strictly social construct?
I hope, but doubt, it can be complete in my lifetime.
I was just there last summer. It hurts to see it brought low. Luckily, it's one of the best known and most famous buildings of its kind, so hopefully, like a phoenix, it will literally rise from the ashes to amaze many future generations to come.
I am glad that there does not seem to be deep interior damage...it broke my heart to see the tower fall.
It's comforting to think that old cathedrals are like software projects: continuously built, renovated, and modified over the centuries. There is no definitive ""Notre Dame"", we only get to see each day's snapshot. This is going to spur a major refactor but the project will still be Notre Dame with the same spirit it's always had.
Hoooow? It survived the English wars, the French revolution, Prussians, huge railway gun of WW1, Luftwaffe, and it burned down in the distant future where we have fire trucks we can call from a device in our pocket?
https://twitter.com/IRockForYou/status/ ... 5897305088 Another pic, bit more wide angle, apparently both from or via an AP photog? Not sure. Somehow this acc. got suspended, not sure why, but could still dig up and screenshot the picture: https://ibb.co/Vqv5BqH Sorry, I'm a bit busy with other stuff but it seems most of the vaults *did* survive. For further corroboration see (sorry, bottom of those tweets. I can never get the hang of this twitledeydoothingy): https://twitter.com/AmichaiStein1/statu ... 9744354304 Yes it looks apocalyptic. But look closer and you see that most of the vaulted ceilings look intact, with just one hole just left of the centre (I think that's underneath where the spire used to be?). My catholic upbringing really hasn't stuck but I'll go for a hallelujah on this one, albeit somewhat cautiously of course.
""In a statement, French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron vowed to the rebuild the cathedral,"" French President Emmanuel Macron is better.
Old, seasoned wood that went up like a match is my guess.
It will be rebuilt again and will stand as a monument of Catholics, of France and of the indomitable human spirit. Notre Dame has withstood worse. It will continue to withstand more.
Good thing we have those high resolution measurements! We can just get a gigantic roll of PLA and print that baby right up! /s of course. Hurts to say it but snazzy tech isn't always the answer.
I never managed to get there. I didn't visit last time I was in Paris due to having a two day panic attack as a result of having my passport stolen while visiting Sacre-Coeur. Hopefully they'll be able to restore it to some of its glory.
Reconstruction will take decades. It will never be the same. The loss of almost 900 years of history is tragic an immeasurable. This was a very sad day.
The interior may be largely undamaged: https://twitter.com/areinaud/status/1117916691353067521 Masonry vaulted ceilings twixt interior and roof, seems to be mostly intact.
The article mentioned possible cause may be linked to ongoing renovations. What a loss, it will be interesting to see the restoration results. The old time craftsmanship and materials will be impossible to duplicate.
I got to see it a few times a couple years ago... glad I got to see it.
This may be a good opportunity to study some hand-cut stone and teach the powered saws how to create a similar look. But if the stone vaulted ceilings are actually intact then there may not be much need for new stone work. Any architecture historians out there able to tell me why you'd put a wood roof over a stone roof? Were they worried about weathering or leaking? Surely the stone is the load-bearing part of the roof structure.
My guess is 10-20 years. Depending on the final damage. I would also expect a steel roof to be installed, and most of the wood removed. The biggest issue will be stonework.
thats the weird thing about tech advancing. we cant even build the satern 5 and that was 40 years ago. people forget just how much tooling/process matters.
It was utterly heart-rending to watch such a historical and cultural treasure burn. Thankfully we can take solace in the fact that: 1. We humans are generally not one to throw up our hands and go ""Welp, so much for that. Let's build a WeWork office!"" 2. The outer structure did not collapse. That would have been soul-crushing. 3. They were able to evacuate a lot of the artifacts and artworks within. 4. Just last week, 16 statues were removed from the spire that collapsed, 12 representing the 12 apostles and 4 evangelicals. So part of even the spire lives on. Hope springs eternal. We move on, we rebuild, we improve, etc. If you engage in ""Nothing matters, everything is misery, gray, and vodka, just like my family"" shit, you need help.
When the only access for the fire equipment to get onto the island is via bridges clogged with rush-hour traffic.
You have to take a very long term perspective when dealing with projects like this. Under construction before you were born, still under construction after you're gone. As the saying goes: Ars longa, vita brevis (Art is long, life is short.) I hope that the leaden roof collapsed due to support failure rather than melting. The smoke damage to the cathedral's stained glass windows will be terrible enough, but if the leaden separators of the small glass tiles has collapsed, reconstruction with the original glass is likely to be impossible.
I wonder if any of the reliquaries got destroyed too
It would be great if that data were put into something like the Unreal engine so that a exploreable version could be made downloadable and playable.
One news report that one rich Frenchperson has already donated €100M toward restoration.
agreed, some one or some group should pitch it to them.
We can't and wouldn't build Saturn V again not because we don't know how, but because by the time we replace the old processes and electronics with those that are more useful and modern, you'll have a new rocket that just looks like Saturn V, and will still be insanely expensive
Waaay back in late 90s not long after Unreal was released (the original - this was before UT even) someone made a demo with the Unreal engine in which the 'player' could walk around the inside of the Notre Dame. Graphics were very good for the time too.
Too busy to trace the source now, but fairly early on representatives from the Notre Dame stated to the press that all relics and (movable) art had been evacuated. What probably also helped a lot is that, due to the ongoing renovations, many objects were stored off-site and were never in danger to begin with.
There is a really great Twitter thread by a Missouri fire official answering questions about when and how the Parisian firefighters were able to do anything: https://twitter.com/GreggFavre/status/1 ... 6786371585 Regarding the obvious fire triad: Quote: Removing the fuel is a no go. Churches have no shortage of things to burn. The heat that a fire this size is putting off is tremendous. Little options for interrupting that. The chemical chain reaction is off to the races. That horse left the stable in the first five minutes. Quote: That leaves the oxygen. Unfortunately, even if the roof had not burnt off, churches are nearly impossible to control ventilation in. Their design is to be open and airy. Great for Sunday worship, terrible for managing fire spread. Regarding larger strategy and safety: Quote: The walls of #NotreDame are stout, but if weakened by fire and roofing timbers could come down. Are the streets in the collapse zone cleared? Of both onlookers and responder/trucks? Any other buildings threatened? If a wall of fire comes down what the plan to fight THAT fire? Read the whole thing.
We know exactly how to build the Saturn V. There's just no point in doing so.
Look's like you'll just have to wait another 50 years before ""retirement"".
A tragic loss of history to lose a structure almost a 1000 years old. Last edited by Photon_plumber on Mon Apr 15, 2019 9:25 pm
It's somewhat comforting knowing that many of the artifacts were able to be saved. It's still a huge tragedy and so much of what burned is likely irreplaceable but knowing at least some of it was saved is a slight silver lining.
As has been noted, it appears that the vaults didn't collapse, had they done so, then the damage would have gone from terrible to absolutely catastrophic and exposed the entire interior to the flames. A common problem in the past was that a fire could collapse the roof beams and take out the vaults too. It's noted that the wooden beams will be hard to replace. Maybe they shouldn't be, maybe? The source of most of the fire is the wooden structure and if they can be replaced with steel beams as they won't be in public view, yeah, not authentic but maybe a better solution to avoid such problems in the future. I don't know, just tossing it out there. Cathedrals were actually designed with fire in mind in reference to the vaults. Take a look at them: https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facs ... e/0007.jpg See where the vaults come down the wall and meet? This forms a pocket where water can accumulate and in case of a fire in the roof. The water from the firefighters (which would be the public in a bucket brigade in the past), could accumulate above the vaults and collapse them from the weight in this area. See this picture of them in a model: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fi ... -vault.png See the pockets that form? At the bottom of the pockets, there is a drain hole, so the water will flow out rather than accumulate. I took a behind the scenes tour of Salisbury Cathedral some years ago and they showed this to us. I was tickled pink at the engineering solution. Last edited by bizzyness on Mon Apr 15, 2019 11:30 pm
Probably not far off. York Minster's rebuild (during the 1980s) took 4 years. It *appears* (we don't know the full extent at Notre Dame of course) to be similar damage (vaulted roof burnt out, walls appear intact, a famous Rose Window appears intact but will need to be carefully dismantled, restored, and rebuilt) but was much smaller - only one transept burnt out in York's case.
The stone is used to make the pointed arches and vaulting. These are like the trusses in your house, but the spans between the vaulting used oak beams, and then lighter roofing material cladding the outside. The hope is that not too many of the stone arches and vaults were ruined, which would jeopardize the integrity/structure of the walls.
I hope it's rebuilt using more modern (or modernized) materials. No non-trivial fraction of 13,000 oak trees is tolerable. Buildings like this suffer catastrophe and are rebuilt/fixed over and over. Were renovators over the centuries expected to use Medieval materials and methods or is this a more recent constraint?
So what you're saying is that they decided to go for an ""add hominin"" approach to science?
The more I read of these long-vanished hominids the lonelier I feel, like a child who survived the house fire that took the rest of their family. I'd like to think that life would have been all the richer had our cousins survived to the present day.
When you have such little physical evidence, you tend to grasp at strawman
The odds are that we are the descendents of the arsonists that set fire to the house.
My more cynical side doesn't like to imagine how chattel slavery would have evolved, and possibly have failed to disappear, with forced laborers who were quite clearly of sub-sapiens intellect. When ""this is wrong, you can't do this, these are people too!"" is a matter of more substantive debate...
The more we find all these branches and offshoots, the more I'm amazed that we're the only ones left. How did that happen? Are we truly the best adapted of all the previous hominids?
As a person of Filipino ancestry, I grew up hearing tales of miniature people that supposedly lived in the forest. Of course, these are just tales that I rightly treat as such, but sometimes I wonder if these tales originally could have been partially based on truth, stories that were told orally by people who actually saw these dwarf-sized human cousins. 50,000 years ago might be a stretch for storytelling, but I seem to recall that Indonesian people had similar tales, and IIRC floresiensis was dated to 15,000 years ago? Edit: read the article better: floresiensis is also 50,000 years old. I highly doubt oral tales could survive intact enough after all that time. Unless, of course, other small human cousins lived on until more recent times. Edit 2: looks like others had similar thoughts about floresiensis when they thought it was only 12,000 years old. From the almighty Wikipedia: “In 2004, when H. floresiensis was believed to have survived until 12,000 years ago, Henry Gee, senior editor at Nature, speculated that local stories about a small human-like creature called Ebu Gogo could refer to H. floresiensis...” Last edited by McDeath on Wed Apr 10, 2019 1:10 pm
My question revolves around arrival. The Philippines has not been connected to the mainland for far longer than the genus homo existed. Did these little guys make boats?
That's a fair question, but I think a better question is whether you can accurately determine that this is a new species from a foot, a few toe phalanges, 7 teeth, 2 fingers, and half a femur. I spent a good portion of my childhood growing up on Luzon and I've been in caves in the area where Callao Cave is. It's not surprising to me that something like this was found there. But like the original question, time and certainly more evidence will need to do the talking about homo luzonensis. Last edited by dmccarty on Thu Apr 11, 2019 8:32 am
I have heard from a reliable source that indigenous tribes exist on the island (denied to be extant by the government) that do not speak austronesian languages ""negritoes"" is the term I heard. Any truth there?
Yes there are indigenous people in the Philippines that predate the arrival of the austronesian people. The Aeta are one I can think off of the top of my head: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeta_people However, this is pretty well known in the Philippines and I’m not aware of any attempts to deny their existence. In fact, I even saw a documentary on Philippine TV about an Aeta who graduated college and planned to help his people or something like that. I don’t think they’d mistake the Aeta or other similar groups as midget/dwarf people. Disclaimer: I grew up in the US, not the Philippines, so my perspective may be off.
Woot Batari from Far Cry Primal !
For what it is worth, this basically sums up the bulk of evidence for hominid evolution. It is amazing to see how much of hominid evolution is based on so little evidence and how new discoveries keep refuting theories.
That would be quite an accomplishment seeing as we are 100% ape.
Current strain came up with better methods of killing out the others.
Best adapted or best at genocide?
I'm reminded of a discussion in Donald Johanson's book Lucy. The distinction was made between anthropological ""lumpers"" and ""splitters."" Splitters were a group who tended to identify every variant fossil as a new species. There is a lot of professional prestige to be gained by ""discovering"" a new species. It also impresses the institutions which provide funding for anthropological explorations. Lumpers maintained that proliferation of ""species"" promoted useless confusion. The only real test of whether individuals are co-specific is interfertility and the continuing fertility of their offspring. Obviously, this is not a test which can be applied to skeletal and dental remains. I personally favor the lumpers case. I would assign both luzonensis and floresiensis to the genus Homo and leave it at that.
Many cultures have tales of 'Little People' in far flung areas of the planet. Edit- Well, they do.

We were the ones who took no prisoners and left no witnesses. Humans are a pretty vicious bunch.
Additionally, we would breed with and assimilate them as well. Don’t forget that aspect!
How can they be certain all the newly found bones are from the same species? Could they not be bones collected by a predator, from differing kinds of prey, and left in the cave?
our long lost cousin is a cave? that explains a lot about my family tree
Years of study and work in the field brings techniques and criteria for establishing such certainty.
Well, the article said ""possibly washed ashore by accident"", but this surely is a stretch. You would need at least a man and a woman to be washed ashore (alive) at roughly overlapping times to start a breeding population and from where and how were they washed ashore by accident anyway? By a tsunami, clinging to driftwood? But yes, boats seem to be a stretch too. Surely a great theme to make a romantic prehistoric movie from!

Probably tens of thousands or more pipe fragments in collections, assuming the archaeologists didn't just start ditching them at some point.
I'm not a big fan of ""estate"" pipes, but this is fascinating.
You don't -- just commit a crime and get it sequenced for free!
I'd have to imagine that since DNA has helped solve crimes recently, that it could really open up the history of some of these finds. Maybe 23andMe will provide a ""Make available for archeological research"" option.
Let's hope they don't get hit with corruption charges at some point in the future for mishandling and abusing the data collection they have amassed.
A fun show to watch, 'Finding Your Roots' on PBS.

He has been surprisingly successful tracking descendants of enslaved people.
Yeah. He's going on about voluntarily paying for sequencing he might not need. Me, I'm outraged over the existence of slavery, the millions of people who died, the culture and history lost, and the fact that it's a couple hundred years later and there are still people who would bring those tragedies back if they could. Guess I'm just weird.

It's not uncommon to find clay pipe bits all over the place! My understanding is that the cheap white clay would soften over time in spittle and stained with tobacco (which has a foul tasting dark tar). One just snapped off an inch or so of the pipe and carried on smoking until it was too short to use. My 'rents place is from around 1540 so a few decades before tobacco was introduced to the UK. Up until the early/mid 20th century you got rid of waste (such that it was, folks seemed to waste a lot less back then) by simply burying it in the garden. I regularly till the soil down there (it's lovely dark brown stuff, no clay, not too many stones - you can grow anything you like in it!) and I'm always finding broken off pieces of clay pipe & broken crockery. Those being the only things that didn't burn or compost. I find a fair number of very rusty, square section, iron nails too. But mostly clay pipe. I've only ever found a couple of the bowl end of the pipe. Even then smashed. A friend of mine found a beautiful pipe bowl near by in the shape of the head of a man. We presumed that this was from a field hand who lost it by accident.
THANK YOU. “That’s especially important as archaeologists have begun to focus more on how ordinary people lived and what kinds of factors impacted their lives.” I would counter that folks who existed and survived through slavery were very far from normal; in fact, I’d posit that they were quite extraordinary and exceptional.

Are your parents vampires? How does vampire reproduction even work? But it sounds like you have yourself a real-life Stardew Valley over there. Kinda cool.
It's a goth thing.
I think I've seen this documentary.
As it happens, there are some records of ethnic and/or geographic origins for slaves living in Louisiana during the 18th and early 19th Centuries, because the Spanish and French administrations kept more detailed records. The New Orleans historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall painstakingly collected and tabulated these records, which are searchable online; she wrote a number of articles and a book about them.
The two lessons to be learned here are: (1) Slavery was a shameful period in US history (which I'm embarrassed about as an American), and (2) To have your DNA preserved for long after ur gone, chew incessantly on a clay object.
I went to the museum of slavery South of Luanda twice. It was closed both times but man can you imagine being loaded onto a Portuguese slave Ship headed to Brazil. It gave me creeps think about that. Slavery still exist.
In South America some Jesuits like Alonso de Sandoval (mentor or Saint Peter Claver) got out of their way to interview and record the origin of as many slaves as they could. I read some passing, but a name that stood out for me was a ""Carabali"", which is a fairly common surname to this day. And it happens there is a tribe in what is now Nigeria that is ""Kalabari"".
Very little remains of the lives of these people, but luckily it doesn't take much for us to find a connection to the past. I have a memory burned into my mind of standing in the Smithsonian watching a woman break down and cry at the sight of shackles so small that they could have only fit a child. There was no story to go along with it, but in a way that is what contributed to making it such a powerful symbol. Similarly, all that we have left of this woman is a piece of her pipe. Everything else was stolen from her.
this is really good.. thank you.
I don't mean to sound an insensitive Ahole, but there is nothing extraordinary/exceptional about slavery/slaves. Its an interesting aspect of humanity/psyche, but its been in existence for thousands and thousands of years, probably for as long as humans started forming groups and conquering other groups. The US didn't invent it, and African's weren't the first to be subject to it (I suspect). Who knows, Karma may rear her ugly head and it may be the white man's turn to play the role some day In any case, the practice continues today, so perhaps instead of constantly crying over milk spilled a few days ago, we should be minding the milk that is spilling right now...

1) Congratulation! Without meaning to, you really nailed sounding exactly as you described; 2) The old and tired defense of “everyone had slaves” is often wheeled out as justification for / whataboutism for chattel slavery in the US. It’s a pathetic excusal for over 400 years of the worst systematic denigration of human dignity, criminal barbarity and codified white supremacy in modern history; 3) Your characterization of slavery in the US betrays a deafening ignorance of this country’s recent history, the ongoing costs and legacies of slavery, and a racist disregard for the realities of intergenerational deprivation of wealth, access to healthcare, redress for state-sponsored horrors and wrongdoing, the callous disregard for the rights of a people, horrific sexual violence against women, lynchings that continue today in various forms, etc. You are stunningly ignorant because you choose to be, and choose to ignore or disregard reality, and fail to see that race, as a social construct, means that the human beings subjected to hundreds of years of the most intense systematic psychological, spiritual and physical abuse imaginable are basically people just like you. And please, shove that played out “it’s been happening for thousands of years” argument back where it belongs.
And again, a stunning lack of understanding abounds. Yes, in fact white Europeans were also enslaved alongside Africans in the 17th century; a group of Dutch and African slaves attempted escape and were caught, and the European slaves were given a number of additional years of servitude, but the African slaves were forced to remain in slavery for life. See, the slaveowners began to realize that they would need to divide and conquer, and it was Portugal that began solely using black African slaves, and began to propagate an ideology of inferiority in order to justify the slave trade. Kind of like today in that, if white people suddenly realized that race is a false construct and that people of color were not much different from them, they’d see the real enemy: wealthy elites who plunder the wealth of society, commit crimes with impunity, subvert democracy and are destroying the planet.
I highly recommend Scene on Radio’s Seeing Whiteness podcast series, episode 32 is called ‘How Race was Made’ and is a great introduction to how ideas of race have been constructed. The whole series should be required listening for all white folks who wish to unlearn the lies and false assumptions they’ve been taught: https://www.sceneonradio.org/seeing-white/

Yeah right... pull the otter one.
Fascinating write-up. Thanks, Kiona.
Problemo: it's all underwater. Plus, much of the debris is going to be removed by tides, unfortunately, and the tool rocks will be eroded very quickly.
slick!.
Depends on time scale, surely. Are we tracking otter populations going back decades, centuries, thousands of years? There may be traces to be found across the expanse of their historical ranges that aren't easily impacted over those various periods.
Read the headline wrong and got exctied for a moment.
This is one of those ""could be a joke, could be real"" stories, isn't it? I halfway expect a magazine on animal tool archaeology to actually exist.
Yeah, I used to have a couple of ferrets and they were very high maintenance. I can just imagine them ten times bigger and shudder. If you want to read about living with otters, try Ring of Bright Water. I read it when I was a kid and recall it fondly.
Reading things like this makes we wonder how much intelligence is truly out there in the world, how much is disappearing due to humanity's actions, how fast we're helping it to evolve in corners of the world due to selective pressure....and once we've moved on and the next species experiences their own Great Leap Forward, what sort of world we will have left them and what spot we will have in their mythologies and stories-of-before.

I remember seeing an otter in the North Woods of Maine. He gave me a look like he'd love to rip my neck just for fun. Very spooky.
I, for one, welcome our evolving mustelid overlords...

I was speaking more to the their behavioral traits than their species,but you are correct in that regard.
I'm sure certain cephalopods create middens as well.
They do. This is how one finds octopus dens. You look for piles of crab shells and then look uphill for a crevice or other opening that might harbour an octopus. If you're gentle and patient, you can often coax them out to play with you. Wonderful, intelligent and curious animals.
Thanks, Kiona, for another really interesting read. I always look forward to your articles.

The tool mark analysis is really interesting, but it’s wierd that the article didn’t mention the most intriguing find, the half-buried sea otter statute of liberty.
If otters could drive they'd drive BMW!
Given today's date, I had to check the link to the publication first.
Wait...You're not dissuading me at all!
They're writing statutes?!
It's legit. I didn't think about the timing when I wrote it up. /facepalm It IS a small but growing field of study, though.
And river otters, not sea otters (a bit smaller)...but they are also absolutely vicious too. I mean, likely not to humans. When I was visiting the Snake River near the Grand Tetons I observed several river otters bust out of the river and chase a coyote about 30 yds before they gave up and turned around. The coyote was nosing around the river edge. Park ranger mentioned that the coyote was looking for river otter young that might be close to the river edge and on their own. Also that if the adult river otters had caught the coyote they would have absolutely killed it (intent and result).
And that's why we link to the paper! I *really* need to double-check my timing next year, though.
Yeah, I've heard this as well - they're not aggressive or particularly territorial, but they want their babies to go uneaten as much as the rest of us, they're smart, and their claws and jaws are optimized for cracking mollusks, so they can and will fuck a coyote all the way up and down if necessary.
I, for one, welcome our adorable right pawed overlords.

It's not an April 1st joke. It's a legit article. Wild sea otter mussel pounding leaves archaeological traces.
And yet, here you are. Spending a lot of time in comments of a supposedly fake article I think once otters set up their own forum, the'd make fun of such wastes of time instead of cracking open a mussel. PS: Based on what others have said, I'm sure making fun of humans would rank pretty high on otter's fun activity category
Now I'm imagining an infinite number of sea otters banging an infinite number of keyboards into an infinite number of rocks and duplicating all the ars comment threads.
OTOH, I'm completely dissuaded. The assholishness is the best part of owning a cat. Similarly, I've recently discovered that shiba inus often have a similar attitude, which has made me heavily consider getting one. (Not even kidding...I'm just weird.)
On the internet, noone knows you're an otter archaeologist.
Thank you, I am going to use that word.
That's interesting that they were able to line up the time frame for these remains with the climate and starvation. The last time I read about these sets of remains, I think there was still a debate over whether it is evidence of some sort of ritual cannibalism or defleshing as funerary rite.
What I find amazing is that our ancestors 120,000 years ago had the tools to do that! While paleoanthropology is far from what I studied in university so my knowledge on what neanderthals and proto-humans were capable of is quite limited.
I have to wonder if the bones of the bodies that were consumed showed signs of starvation. Would we be able to detect privation from such old finds? This might answer the question of whether they were consumed after dying, or sacrificed for the good of the group.
""“The cannibalism highlighted at Baume Moula-Guercy is not a mark of bestiality or sub-humanity,” Defleur and Dasclaux wrote. If anything, it’s a gut-wrenchingly human story of hard choices in desperate times."" Absolutely, there's further examples of this with modern humans in the most desperate times, there's some awful historical pictures out there with people selling butchered children (afaik they didn't kill them, but they were starving and the children died, and as such became a commodity), both in the siege of Stalingrad and in the Chinese famines (where reportedly there was a saying that roughly translated to trading children so they wouldn't have to eat their own) Warning, not safe for life, but it's worth remembering our darkest moments.... https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/co ... sh_at_the/ Ah, anyways, just got me thinking of that, and wondering if the Neanderthals would have struggled with it as much as us.
A sad tale indeed. A reminder that the universe is continually trying to kill us. For all our smarts we are never far from potential catastrophe.

Anasazi-area cannibalism: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ ... -85274508/ Iirc, the Anasazi are thought to be the ancestors of the Hopi and Pueblo Indians.
A starved human will eat anything and I mean anything, no wonder our genetic cousins did the sane.
fun fact laws for cannibalism around the world are very strange.
If cannibals are going to eat me I want them to at least turn me into a gourmet feast. Like wrap me in parchment paper so I don’t dry out or braise me so I’m tender. Also pair me with a nice wine.
I somehow hadn’t thought about that previous major interglacial and how there were lots of humans around then already. Did Neanderthals migrate north during this time to follow the steppe, or was the change too sudden?
You’ll be the most delicious thing ever, guaranteed. Every meal is unbelievable when you’re that hungry.
What I wonder when I read this article is how did the clan decide which members got to live and which were to be sacrificed to feed everyone else. Perhaps those killed had done some bad deed or something, but then why kill the young children? What could they have done? Perhaps all those killed were a father and his children, and maybe the father did something and they just killed the kids because they were his; guilt by association. Very interesting to think about.
Never been more glad to see that most Americans are obese
Note to self: Plan to find that article about clothing lice. Clothing lice are pretty selected for on where they can live (just like head lice) and an evaluation of louse genes gave when clothing was invented. Pretty sure that a clothing louse habitat would require sewing, which would require more tech than I could make.
Style quibble: it would have been better to say ""twenty to thirty feet"" as the freedom units equivalent of six to nine meters, rather than using the spuriously accurate conversion you did.
The victims might simply have died first. If you're that desperate for food there's no sense wasting perfectly good meat.
Yes. I had thought of that. But if that were the case, why weren't the bones given an honorable burial instead of just being cast out with the animal bones?
Maybe they didn't see dismembered skeletal remains as a thing worth burying (i.e. as a ""person"").
“. . . about 2⁰C higher . . .” A superscript zero is not a degree symbol.
I'd prefer fava beans and a nice Chianti.
Maybe the person was from a rival clan, so also had no symbolic importance to them. And/or maybe guilt about cannibalism contributed to them not treating the bones like a ""person"". I would imagine it's emotionally easier to engage in cannibalism if one goes out of one's way to not treat the carcass differently than any other animal carcass one might butcher. (The point being that the manner in which the remains got dismembered might matter. If they had found the dismembered remains of a relative, perhaps killed by wolves, maybe they would still bury it. But once the remains have been ""food"", there might be an emotional imperative to avoid recognizing the remains as human.)
Not a mystery, really. This was the Moula-Guercy Churrasco-Style Steakhouse -- for the A-list neanderthal celebs it was to the place to see and been seen.
Fascinating article, well done Ars.
Looks good here. Our fonts may vary, of course. I use a font which has ""1,"" ""l,"" and ""I"" distinguishable. O versus 0 is a bonus. Also fuck. Seems I'm not anymore here on Google chrome browser for android. Goddam 2do list.
If you plug the character into a character identifier, it identifies it a ""superscript zero"" (U+2070). The degree symbol is a different character (U+00B0). The degree symbol should be round in pretty much any font, unlike a zero.
Young children did nothing, that's precisely the issue, in the short terms they are a threat for the group surviving. More surprising are the teenagers, old enough to gather food. Maybe they just eat the weakest members of the group, the ones representing a load with less chance of surviving the current crisis.
I think any starving animal behaves this way, not just us, so even more evidence of same. That said, from my studies (PhD dropout in archaeology way back when), there is very little compelling evidence of ""nutritional cannibalism"" -- that is cannibalistic cultures that routinely seek out human meat as a nutritional supplement. There is good evidence (and this article points to some great findings along these lines) of starvation cannibalism. This form is rare, and something each practitioner would have liked to avoid. Ritual cannibalism also has good evidence of widespread practice. But all the stories of the Polynesians, South Americans, Native Americans, or Aboriginal Australians eating strangers as a food (or ""delicacy"") are just made-up narratives - justifying colonization, religious conversion, extermination, enslavement, de-culturing, etc.
Very interesting but cruel art the same time, bit because of the act but rather what pushed them to do that.
FlibberyGiveit said. ""Clothing lice are pretty selected for on where they can live (just like head lice) and an evaluation of louse genes gave when clothing was invented. Pretty sure that a clothing louse habitat would require sewing, which would require more tech than I could make."" Maybe ""clothes"" for a long time meant a sort of skin toga just knotted together. Birch bark leggings tied with grass string.

And that, folks, is how you get funding for a 5-year Ph.D thesis. Edit: It's a light-hearted poke, not a damnation.
Or they were from another hunter-gatherer band and got captured.
I listened to a podcast on the subject (Stuff You Should Know, I think) and one of the conclusions was that purely from an energy perspective, cannibalism doesn't make sense. You get more usable calories from a deer than from a human, and deer don't fight back. Any cannibalism was likely out of desperation (as evidenced here) or ritual (eating dead relatives to honor them/eating slain foes to fully conquer them).
It's all calories all the way down... I feel pretty bad for our cousins, growing ever closer to extinction, slowly being starved out of existence. Eating your own relatives and friends at the toughest of times. They were tool makers, artists, story tellers (I imagine), and we ended up depicting them as grunting unintelligent cave dwellers that deserved to go extinct compared to ""Modern"" humans. It's barely even 10 years since we first proved many of us have a couple of percent Neanderthal DNA kicking around our own genomes. It's a great pity none survived.
I always find it curious how much sentimentality and presumption surrounds the Neanderthals. There is evidence of tool-making, art-making, and their close genetic similarity to us, but we know next to nothing about their culture, and nothing at all about their value system. We see ourselves in them: but that's not science. They shouldn't be made a proxy for debates about human nature.
considering how small the sample is there's always the chance that it was just the hidey hole of some crazed serial killer and not a sign of a widespread social norm (or even just norm-ish during critical emergency times)
*lol* about morality. Initially those religions meant very often that a few “chosen ones” declared themselves (semi-)gods. This hasn't changed much. Religion is still very useful in promising the poor sobs rewards AFTER they are dead, while those who are in charge take everything they can while stile alive.
""Don't piss off the skywizard, or we'll kick you out into the wilderness"" could be a powerful motivator.
Funny how the character of divine resembles that of its spokesmen. I mean how would they know the skywizard gets pissed off when I disagree with its messengers
Make fun all you want, but once my check for $59.95 gets to Houson and I get my Official Lakewood Church Prayer Shawl of Riches from Pastor Osteen and I'm rolling in heaven money you'll feel sorry.
This reminds me of how Christopher Hitchens argued morality in the context of the early Israelites. If gods or religion were required to have a functioning society, then there's no way the Israelites could have survived long enough to get to Mount Sinai (where Moses introduced the ten commandments) in the first place. The idea that we need a supernatural force to create and enforce morality for us is bunk. I mean, it's really not that complicated. Imagine if murder was legal. It might be nice to *ahem* purge a boss you don't like, but now there's absolutely nothing stopping anyone else from doing the same to you. The golden rule (do unto others as you would have done to yourself) is really just common sense that protects our own interests. As always, the only people exempt from this rule are the rich and powerful. Last edited by chronomitch on Fri Mar 22, 2019 12:33 pm
Deities may have become large and moralizing but many (most?) were conjectured, then asserted, explanations for various observations.
Didn't the Euthyphro dilemma cleared up this argument in ancient times?
It's an amazingly profitable racket if you can do it right. Hubbard demonstrated it for us; some of us got to watch it happen in real time. Few people are sociopathic enough to pull it off, but it only takes one raving narcissist to plunge an entire society into slavery and nonsense. Xin, the pharaohs, etc, who squandered their treasuries and countless lives just to build a fancy house for their decaying meat.
On a serious note....I both agree and disagree here. I don't think religion was necessary to form a society, but I do think it was paramount in bridging tribal gaps to assimilate OTHER societies into your society and force them into your moral and cultural norms. I think on the whole humans are fairly good at not wanting to steal from and murder people that look like us or have shared background but we're pretty rubbish at it when the other person is different in any way. In the absence of law enforcement and other forces, if you want the star bellied Sneetches to stop stealing your crap and raping your tribe members telling them that they face eternal damnation for it is a useful tool to get them on the same page.
That does sound plausible: - People who vaguely worshipped individual gods got together in big cities (like Ankh-Mopork). - Eventually, inevitably the guy in charge realizes that an uber-god whose message is 'The King is My representative, do whatever he says. Oh yeah, and be peaceful and work hard.' is a fantastic way to stay in office and accumulate lots of wealth. You see this today. - The priests are happy to play along for wealth and power. You also see this today. - After a couple thousand years, religious people just assume religion had to come first, because if not for a big scary guy in the sky everyone would be raping and murdering 24/7, right? I sure would! Why are you looking at me like that? So in this scenario giant organized religion is less necessary and more inevitable parasitism.
The foundation series are good books.
Until they decide that their skywizard (or, worse, their interpretation of the same skywizard) is superior to your heretical heathen leanings.
Reading this, the first thing which came to mind.
Incas didn’t have “big, moralizing gods or supernatural forces?” Or do you mean they just got their empire without having developed those ideas first? I mean were human sacrifices not for their god Viracocha?
You're thinking of Maya, not Incas {Edit} Correction, I was wrong, learned something, thanks Last edited by SomeAndrian on Fri Mar 22, 2019 12:26 pm

Add Machu Picchu's bonuses and they should have been unstoppable.
Inca started out with lots of gods (and never ditched most of them). Viracocha created the world and the other gods then disappeared. So the most influential god early on was Inti, the sun god. But you had Mamacocha the water goddess, Illapa the thunder and lightning god, Mamaquilla the calendar goddess, and literally thousands of huachas (everything was assumed to have a spirit, and big and powerful ones like mountains would be worshipped to) and sky gods. These gods didn't tend to be moralizing. Not much 'thou shalt' at all. The Incas still prayed to them and offered them sacrifices, but there aren't many stories at all of the gods actually showing up and smiting people directly or causing miracles directly. They were mostly influencers. Later on, after the empire was built, they started to converge on Big Powerful God Viracocha (I guess he came back). But he wasn't really the direct intervention type, it was more they felt they owed him. Last edited by sarusa on Fri Mar 22, 2019 12:50 pm

Well don’t use an unsigned int then.
Religion is less about societal rules and more about legitimizing the ruling class with a divine power. Almost all early megasocieties had myths to reinforce the notion of the ruling family/class superiority. Still, making the laws part of the religion helped to keep in check the population. Even now, some people believe more in religion than in the laws of man.
Didn't the Inca expansion start roughly a century before the arrival of the Spanish? So it's not really a counter-example to their observed pattern that moralising ""religion usually appeared around 100 years after the megasociety boom"".
I have to wonder which side of the discussion you consider to be bigoted, and which side is perfectly acceptable.
Funny how that always seems to happen the moment you show up.
A small correction: Kama is volitional action. Its consequences are Karma Vipaka.
That's actually not something you can prove. It's ASSUMED that's the way it worked, but archeological explanations are handicapped by the lack of context in many cases where ""art"" and ""religion"" exist. An archeologist may see a small carved ""female idol"" and speculate that it had religious significance, while another archeologist may simply see a toy to amuse a kid with. Without knowing a lot more context about the society, it's not possible to be certain which, if either, of those explanations is true. Maybe it was a neolithic sex doll. Exactly HOW religion came to be is still a mystery. Your statement is a valid hypothesis with evidence to support it, but objectively, it's not a conclusive one, nor one that explains the rise of every religion. But one thing stands out fairly well with each flavor of invisible sky friend: That religion 's message is uniquely suited to the society in a way that supports the ruling class. This may simply mean that religions were invented as a means for those who were not lucky enough to be born into the ruling class or possessed of unusually high martial skills to achieve power without being wiped out by the ruling class, by aiding the ruling class in maintaining peace and control over the population. Some ruling classes may have invented it as a way to vent/suppress frustration on the part of those ruled to keep them in line as well. The myriad religions in the early phases all evolved from within their societies and worked toward supporting the ruling class. Once resources/population pressures increased, wars were much easier to start by pointing out the differences between the religious beliefs of each society, and how Ukluk of the Blue Mud was in some way better than Ooobaniuki of the Red Mud. As a means to control a population, religion tends to work better than martial force. It's one thing to rebel against a king. It's another to rebel against a god. So it's a convenient tool for the ruling class(es) to use to keep power. From a human nature point of view, to me, that makes the most sense as to why a particular religion and particular way of life were so closely linked.

Huh? That's nonsense... What you're getting at is that we shouldn't condescend and adopt colonialist tropes, but it's absurd to try to make that point by asserting that society's structure doesn't become more complex as they become more advanced and sophisticated.
I think the correct term would be Theophobia.
Britons continue this tradition in modern times, except instead of Stonehenge it's Glastonbury and instead of pigs it's drugs. Imagine how muddy and awful the fields must have been following the feasts, especially with no portapotties!
It is great that this kind of research is getting more publicity. We've known far more about ancient Egypt than we have about neolithic Britain, a consequence in part of our weather and access to wood for structures rather than stone. The realisation that in many ways Durrington is more important than Stonehenge is a bit like the realisation that today Canary Wharf is a lot more important than St. Paul's Cathedral. The tombs are interesting, but the business of making money is much more important. Much later than this period, swineherds were high status individuals in Celtic societies. Cattle were a sign of wealth, but the production of cattle as status symbols can result in their being less good for milk and meat production. ""The little gentlemen who pay the rent"" are easier to raise and their meat is relatively easy to preserve. As anyone who lives around here knows, a pig shortage is unlikely. Talking completely off the top of my head, it suggests that as pigs were brought from so far either they had a major ritualistic significance or the people who brought them did not have much in the way of trade goods they could exchange for food. Given what a rich agricultural area this is, it doesn't seem unlikely. London is full of restaurants, but poorer visitors to the capital have to bring their own sandwiches.
The number of people involved would be far fewer. Over 130 000 people come here most years and congregate in a few fields at Pilton. One estimate for the entire population of Great Britain (the island) circa 2500BCE is a quarter of a million. It is unlikely that half the population would make these treks. I suspect the numbers would be a few thousand. Also - what makes you think the people of the time didn't have drugs of their own? It seems that the first thing people do when they get civilised enough to realise where babies come from is to find something to get off their heads on.
Weird, now I have a craving for this roasted pig I had once. It was so succulent and moist and insanely tasty. Like better than bacon good. I know, hard to believe, but it was professional caterers.
Just move to Wiltshire. We buy ours direct from free range farmer. Or you could try Shropshire or Norfolk. Nowadays even Normandy pork is pretty poor because they raise pigs in intensive units indoors.
I was today years old when I learned that there are more henges.
Good to know the love for pork extends back to Druidian times. Watch out for those flying pigs though... If you didn't care What happened to me And I didn't care for you - We would zig-zag our way Through the boredom and pain Occasionally glancing up through the rain - Wondering which of the Buggers to blame And watching the pigs on the wing
Colour me impressed by our ancestors' organisation, communication and navigation skills.
Any evidence supporting my long held theory that Stonehenge is a actually a neolithic pot stand in which a giant fire was created and a massive Lodge cast iron pan given to the ancient Celts by time traveling aliens was placed upon for the cooking of said pork products?

Sure, why not travel a bit. It's a nice place to have a company picnic and a pot-luck lunch, or perhaps a little get-together for a 'burning man' type festival. Those Druids may have been real party animals.
The isotopes: ranked 1. 87/86 Sr Depending on local geology, 87/86 Sr can be great. The authors make a good case for this in England, where geology is not too complex and there are strong boundaries. 2. d18O: I am much more skeptical that oxygen isotopes will be useful for this sort of thing. The problem is seasonal rainfall changes: http://wateriso.utah.edu/waterisotopes/ ... nality.pdf There is probably 3-4 per mill variation in d18O in England. Given that the effect size for this isotope in the article is 5-6 per mill, this is a huge amount to leave unaccounted for. 3. d13C varies by both diet and climate, so it shouldn't be used for any kind of sourcing unless you have a major ecotonal (read: environmental) boundary. And even then, one would be assuming today's climate represents the climate of 4,000 or so years ago. 4. d15N - ditto, primarily a diet effect. Maybe useful for marine/non-marine, depending on what they fed the pigs. 5. d34S - this is interesting and unusual, while I'm not convinced, I am hopeful. I suspect the authors overall conclusion is correct - pigs were transported for feasting. I am skeptical most of the data that they have gathered makes a strong case. I suspect if you threw out d13C, d18O, and d15N, you'd be left with almost the same conclusion.
That's the thing right there. if you throw a big party and people are traveling you will always get a variety of foods. The bigger the party , the farther they come from the bigger the variety. this is quite literally as old as man. I would be more surprised to find it untrue.
If you survived the winter you’d probably be in the mood to party too. Not to mention all the tail you’ll get with that pig you’ve been fattening up.
♫You know that I care what happens to you And I know that you care for me too So I don't feel alone Or the weight of the stone Now that I've found somewhere safe To bury my bone And any fool knows a dog needs a home A shelter from pigs on the wing♫ On topic, I recently caught an episode of Expedition Unknown about Stonehenge that was rather interesting. I was surprised to learn there were more henges scattered about the UK, and some of them were quite massive, like Avebury.
I was curious about this myself. Were they moving pigs around, or moving feed around? Hard to untangle in some of these cases, it seems. It would not surprise me at all to learn that trade networks were a lot more complex and extensive than we might have surmised, and that lots of goods traveled significant distances on a regular basis. We've seen this in the Americas, with turquoise jewelry from the southwest turning up in sites in the Great Lakes region. And Britain's a lot smaller.
People walking for weeks to get into a party or religious ceremony? We still do that, only we orefer cars, buses or trains if avaliable.
PARTY!
From all over, huh? Sounds like quite the hoot n' nanny. A whole lot of hoot, a little bit of nanny.
Who else came here to see pictures of a festival over at Stonehenge? Can you walk right up to it?
Unlike Stonehenge, most of the other henges are fully pedestrian accessible. Supposedly over 1300 in total in Britain. My favorite would be one in the Lake District near Keswick. The stones are not remarkable (except for being there), but it is on a slight rise with absolutely magnificent 360 views. https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/vis ... ne-circle/
Is there evidence of owl consumption? /j
It would be horrible if Great Britain became un-henged....
Given the difficulty of moving live swine, I wonder how many of the nonresident pigs made their journey in the salted and smoked condition.
I expect the only food available locally was at the museum cafe, which was overpriced and horrible. Seriously, though, I wonder if this was a logistical issue (the region couldn't produce enough livestock to support the festival), a limitation of their economics (no system by which you could just buy food while you travelled to the event) or if there was some ritual purpose to bringing the livestock to that place for slaughter/sacrifice.
Not to pick on you, but these festivals took place thousands of years before the Druids. Last edited by ihatewinter on Wed Mar 20, 2019 2:18 pm
There is a great BBC series hosted by Neil Oliver called ""The World of Stonehenge"" that illustrates the stone circles all over Great Britain. Found on youtube.
In America we have all kinds of agricultural fairs especially at autumn harvest time as well as food fairs such as Chili Cook-offs where contests are held to judge the quality of livestock as well as food. Perhaps there were contests to judge the porkers from disparate places at these festivals. A winner would get a whole year's braggin' rights and bring prestige to his locale.
Wait, you mean Spın̈al Tap was wrong? My world is shattered....
Yeah, but they gave us Volume Level 11, so it's all good.
Maybe they preferred taking along living animals to their travels, because their meat remained fresh and required no storage or transportation. As far as beverages were concerned, many of those were probably alcoholic for the same reason of conservation.
If the swine were transported alive, any escaped swine would cross breed. Would that not show up in any DNA data? But that does not appear to have been tested.
I hear Camelot is good pig country.
Saltmarsh lamb is amazing. I mentioned Normandy because it isn't that climatically different from Southern England and is, in fact, quite close. Cheese, though, we used to get ours on trips to France till our local suppliers caught up with artisanal production. You're right, there are not as many free range pigs - but there is no shortage of local suppliers. I really don't know what impelled my distant ancestors to leave their estate and emigrate with that right bastard. They ended up in Norfolk, and I bet they were kicking themselves for a long time. ""I always knew feudalism was a bad idea.""
As the article notes, and as my wife observed when we discussed it, transporting pigs is no fun at all. A lot would depend on how far boats had progressed - though getting a squealing pig into a frail wood and leather craft would be just as fun.
Wrong society entirely. They weren't even the same genotype as the society than had druids.

Bettina Schulz Paulsson, an archaeologist at the University of Gothenburg, reexamined some 2,410 radiocarbon dating results that have been assigned to Europe’s megaliths and put them through a Bayesian statistical analysis. Based on the picture the data present, Schulz Paulsson believes that the megaliths were first constructed by dwellers of northwest France during the second half of the fifth millennium BC. From this single origin, her analysis suggests, the practice of constructing standing stone monuments spread during three major periods via what may have been surprisingly robust maritime travel routes."" ""“It’s not quite 100 percent pinned down, and there’s always other research to do, but that [theory] seems like a very plausible scenario,” Scarre says. “This study falls in with the more accepted idea that there are links between these different regions with megalithic monuments. The challenge is to understand how those links worked.”"" ""There’s been no shortage of speculation as to why the practice spread, Scarre says. “People as far back at the 19th century said this could be seen as a ritually related thing, so maybe what it’s spreading is a kind of religious idea. It may have something do to with social structures. These are very impressive monuments, so maybe it’s something to do with patterns of prestige or social emulation.” It may be that some of these ideas spread among peoples, to be adapted locally by cultures in different regions. That scenario would match the findings in the field. “One of the puzzles about it all, whether or not you’re entirely convinced by the dates, there’s still the issue of why is it that the monuments are built in strongly regional architectural traditions,” Scarre says. “Iberian tombs fall into several series, but they are a bit different from the ones you’d find in France, which are a bit different from those you’d find elsewhere and so on.” Schulz Paulsson hopes it might be possible to untangle more of these ancient interchanges of people or ideas by an ongoing study of megalithic art, the engravings and paintings found adoring these ancient sites. “We’re collecting the symbols and images we have in Europe, and comparing the patterns and combinations we see in different regions,” she says. “The interesting thing so far is that only in northern France, which I am showing as the origin of the megaliths, do we have boats depicted. So I find that really fascinating.”""

yeaaahh..... ""The beatings will continue until moral improves"" comes to mind.
I knew Cortes did it, and thought it was dramatic. I didn't realize it was SOP in Spanish navies of the day.
So except for the arrogance of one man, the Aztecs almost didn't get destroyed? I never knew that. What a shame.
They were pretty doomed. Their neighbours hated them and then 90% of the population was going to die within a few years due to smallpox, measles, and so on.
I've always been interested in the Cortez and Pizarro conquests. How such small forces could bring down such large empires. You have to wonder if Cortez wasn't able to recruit the groups upset with Aztec cruelty and rule if the empire might have had time to realize the threat and marshal resources to put up a more powerful resistance. I suppose that wouldn't have stopped disease though. Hope they find the ships!
Cortes won in large part due to his alliances with other natives that utterly despised the Aztecs. From what we know about the Aztec Empire, it was oftentimes far more brutal and repressive than the worst of the European colonial powers
EDIT: Misread your comment, deleted.
>>...or something else entirely.<< R'yleh?
...I'm not sure if the Aztecs getting destroyed was a ""shame"". Other Mesoamerican cultures? Sure, definitely. The Aztecs... not so much.
Yeah. One can build quite the case against Cortes, but it's hard to see the *Aztecs* as anything but just a different (and frankly, even more bloodthirsty) imperial venture. What may have happened as a result of Cortes's conquest to many of those subject peoples is, of course, a different story.
We can go even further: Without those allied subject peoples, Cortes simply could NOT have won. Five hundred men with steel swords, armor, arqebuses, and horses may have significant combat multipliers over a pre-Iron Age society, but there is simply no way they could have conquered it (let alone kept it) without lots and lots of local help. Even if the local help had buyer's remorse later.
Human nature is human nature. In any large groupings of people you'll find kindness and humility, but also power and cruelty. The ill treatment of women, slavery, wars over territory, were all notions found across the many pre-Columbian nations of North America. Of course the European colonization brought more, on different scales, and to different degrees … but the simplistic notion that somehow the people of North America were just naïve peaceniks who universally loved their neighbors and trees is an insult to their varied cultures and practices (good and bad).
Movies like ""Dances With Wolves"" revived the old 18th century concept of the ""noble savage"", where the natives were closer to ""natural man"". The native inhabitants of the Americas had their wars, their human sacrifice, along with rich and vibrant colors, but too often, as in ""1492: The Conquest of Paradise"", the Europeans were depicted as universally evil, (they generally were pretty crappy people), while the natives were poor innocents. While the Aztecs may have been some of the worst, it is a tragedy that so much of their culture was destroyed by Catholic priests because they apparently felt it was all the work of the devil. Perhaps not as tragic as the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, but still pretty bad.
I can imagine is was more like “The beatings will continue... that is all” with Cortez.
The 90% population decline took a couple of centuries to complete. It wasn't a population crash, but rather a population decline that, while it devastated many cultures, did not wipe them out essentially overnight.
The search for Monteczuma's treasure still endures...
The destruction of the Library at Alexandria wasn't as devastating as many people think. Some unique writings were lost, but most of its contents were copies and other copies existed in other libraries around the ancient world. Likewise, the culture devastation by the Catholic priests is somewhat overstated. As they have the world over, the Church adopted many local customs to ease the transition, and many of them stayed put. I'm not minimizing the changes forced on them, but many of those were political or economic and driven by the Spanish and other European crowns (or at least their local representatives), not so much the Church.
I’d argue that what the Spanish did in Central America was far more heinous than the decline of the library of alexandria. They attempted to wipe out an entire culture and history and replace it their own. They maliciously destroyed knowledge at a time where its costs were better understood than the neglect of repository 1000+ years earlier. De Landa’s destruction of Mayan knowledge was recorded, so they knew the consequences of their actions https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_de_Landa “Despite the widespread modern belief that the Library was ""burned"" once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries” https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria
Anyone interested in this subject should read ""The Conquest of New Spain"" by Bernal Diaz - a rare first person account of this kind of brutal colonialism.. He goes into quite a bit of detail about how Cortez accomplished the military takeover of the Aztecs and related people. The stories of what happened once the Conquistadors were inside the gates of the capital (Tenotitchlan, irrc) is truly bizarre and remarkable, leading to the murder of the king of the Aztecs, I think. For all his horrific war and genocidal crimes (in the modern context), burning his ships was either strategic, brave, or foolhardy: we're either going to die here or conquer this place. It certainly wasn't lacking self-confidence..
The was no such think as the Catholic church when the Library of Alexandria was burnt. There was one single Church that recognised both the Latin and Greek rites. The Library was burnt during one of the riots surrounding the Arian hersey.
I had ""learned"" and have always believed that when the spainards burned their ships they took the metal fittings out first. The logic being wood was plentiful and could (eventually) be replaced but the metal fittings were more difficult to replace in the field. Hopefully the people doing this magnetometer work are more knowledgeable on the subject and are sure there's a substantial amount of metal to look for.
The Church went out of its way to destroy Maya codices. This is attested to, in writing, by the priests who were ordering the destruction.
You beat me to it. All Cortez really had to do was have the one guy come in and sneeze a few times.
You could almost say he was lucky, when he arrived, the rest of civilizations were trying to gather up and bring the aztecs down (which was the most powerful army/civilization), there's even an event called ""La noche triste"" (could be translated to: ""The sad night""), where the spanish fought the aztecs by themselves and lost, however he convinced the rest of the civs to join his cause against the aztecs (also, some civilizations confused the spanish people with gods, due to their different racial features), and the spanish brought diseases that didn't exist in Mexico and killed a lot of population. So basically, Cortez achieved his goal by convincing the rest of the empire to join his cause, if he had fought the aztecs by themselves (like they did and lost), it's almost certain that they would have not been able to conquer the empire, however, the diseases they brought would have dramatically lower the empire's population. Sorry for bad english and grammar, hehe. I'm mexican.
Ever since I was little, I always wanted to dive under water, with some sort of suit that would allow you to dive deep enough, to find treasures, and shipwrecks. Then when I got older, I realized that Spain claims a vast majority of these ruins, and doesn't offer you a dime for them. They just take you to International court, and win. Well Spain, you can keep your blood gold, onboard your goverment slave ships, and hopefully have enough to pay the Ferryman in Hell, to drop you off in your nicely lit pit of despair: For my dreams have been thrown overboard. Edit: Apparently after 300 years, it's considered abandoned and the proceeds do not go to the original nation, unless it's in their territorial waters. That said, there have been some claims where Spain won in international waters, because it was a goverment ship. A treasure hunting company called Odyssey Marine Exploration, where they found the treasure outside of Spain's purview, and a federal judge ruled that the findings go to Spain: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44302476 Last edited by smoothsorbate on Fri Mar 01, 2019 7:56 pm
I gotta say, you show up in giant ships with big huge animals and fire sticks that blow limbs off and just before you showed up a whole bunch of my people get sick and die, you better believe I'm going to think you're some kind of deity. Probably an evil deity, but clearly you've got some serious powers.
Actually, it seems almost certain that there were a number of fires, deliberate or otherwise, of the Library, starting with Julius Caesar and ending with the Arab Conquest in 642, with the worst ones in the early Roman period. A multi-stage destruction, if you will.
And this is why we should vaccinate
Yup.
Thanks for bringing up De Landa - one of the true villains of history, on the order of some of the worst Nazi leaders. He systematically and thoroughly didn't just subjugate a people, but destroyed the history and languages of an entire culture area made up of a number of civilizations. He deserves a lot of blame and scorn for the damage he's done to whole region of people and their history and culture.
I'm not so sure that the destruction of the Aztec culture was avoidable. The Church had a large role to play in supporting the feudal power structure in Europe at the time, and I'm sure that government model was exported to the New World. Which meant that the existing culture had to be destroyed as completely as possible in order that Christianity could replace it.
Feudalism was over in Western Europe by the 16th century. The black death caused a massive shortage of labour undermining the whole structure in the 14th century.

After crossing the Zhang River, Xiang Yu ordered his men to sink all their boats and break their cooking pots. He issued each soldier three days' rations and warned them that there was no way to retreat; the only thing they could do to survive was to advance and fight. After nine fierce battles, the Qin army was finally defeated.
The Church was a partner in crime when it comes to colonization. It's odd that it's complicitness isn't more well known in the former Spanish colonies. The US documented this in both the 1903 census and in the Philippines country study. The 1903 version is pretty blunt, which matches the times. Spanish colonial administration was pretty standardized worldwide, so I'd expect the same across the board.
There's an interesting book written by one of the conquistadors, Bernal Diaz del Castillo. The book is titled in English ""The True History of the Conquest of New Spain"". You can probably find it at your library. He was not a happy soldier. And the descriptions of the Moctezuma (basically called him homosexual) and the way the Aztecs lived was not flattering, but since it was written from the point of view of a conqueror it's not surprising. What was surprising was how the spanish lived with the Aztecs shortly. They didn't go in and just kill everyone - they didn't have the numbers of troops. It's been a long time since I read it, but I think they moved into the Aztec capitol and joined the court before turning on the Aztecs.
Also look up Paraguay, and La leyenda negra y la leyenda blanca. At least one Catholic priest had the brilliant idea of representing to the Spanish king how the number of his subjects was being multiplied by Spanish conquests but the conquistadores were killing them and so (a) damaging the reputation of the Spanish crown and (b) harming his empire. It had some effect. As for Cortez, the personality parallels with the Austrian corporal are obvious.
Wasn't the Philippines study an attempt to cover up the massacres conducted by the US in their conquest?
Nice write up Kiona. I especially appreciate the units in the mm(inches) format. I know ars is an American website but it is also a science website and should encourage the use and education of the global standard. Someday maybe America can get off its high horse and join the rest of the world in using a rational units system. Continuing the conventions just validates. Someone has to buck the system. Ars should be that someone.
Apparently, dirty needles are not a new phenomenon.
It makes me wonder what other little insights into the lives of our distant ancestors are buried somewhere in a museum archive. And with something like tattoos, I'm not sure if we will ever know what significance they had for the people then... Badge of rank? Simple decoration? ""Guardian angel on shoulder"" style of mark of faith? And I can imagine how much of what we understand might actually be wrong, just because of what survived for us to see. I mean, I can imagine someone a thousand years from now having a completely different understanding of today's life because of the volume of Facebook/Instagram/YouTube crap we have now...
That artifact looks to be AMAZINGLY well preserved, even for something coming from a desert area. I'd've thought that the wooden parts and the leaves would have rotted, gotten moldy or decayed at some point over the last 2000 years, but it looks like it was made yesterday. I hate to cast shade at this, but was it actually carbon dated at any point, or the specifics of the ink analyzed to determine its age? Not knowing the specifics of where it was found and under what conditions, it's difficult to reconcile its apparently ""almost new"" appearance with something that's been laying around for two millennia. I mean, great discovery if all of that isn't in doubt, of course, but still... Given the lack of certainty about the use of tattoos in ancient indigenous peoples in the U.S., this is pretty definitive proof that it happened, assuming it's authentic and has been certified as such by others. After all, I can see a researcher today who knew nothing about it finding a fake with faked documentation as to its discovery and announcing it to the world as the real deal. I'd love to know more about the details about what allowed something like that to be so amazingly well preserved for so long, or what tests were done to definitively determine it's age.
The linked DOI will give you specifics.
I wouldn't say it's a high horse as it is stubbornness. I've switched my car and devices to C instead of F as a way to exercise my brain and it's not a simple matter of conversions to get comfortable with a different standard.

Some OSes make it easier than others. In MacOS, typing accented letters is pretty straight forward. Unless I'm missing something, it's a lot more difficult in Windows.
Not really. This has not so much to do with an OS as it has to do with a keyboard layout. Either add multiple languages and use WIN+SPACE to switch between (works on some popular Linux distros as well, mainly Ubuntu and co) or just use a custom keyboard layout, if you want you could even just use the MacOS one. There are also compose keys in both that allow inputing all accents as COMPOSE followed by letter+accent e.g. press&release ALT then u+"".
OR skip all that, don't worry about accents and those that complain about their absence.(Europeans and their high horse over funny makings. Us Americans are gonna pronounce 'em wrong anyway.)
America is a prudish society; we don't like nipples on vowels here.
Indeed. I'm blushing just reading 'nipples'. Think of the children!
Not for nothing but, I'm just curious why there are two needles side-by-side... is there some benefit to that from a tattooing perspective, over just having a single cactus needle?
Parallel lines?
I like the metric system. I'd never used the imperial system until my current job. That being said, I find working in fractions of inches to be more intuitive for the kind of work I do right now. For some reason I find it much easier to visualize, say 1/4"" than 6mm, and most equivalent measurements. I find with mm and cm the numbers start to get too big too quickly to really keep a concrete concept of the relative sizes in my head. This is coming from someone that grew up with the metric system, I live in Canada, and never learned imperial until around 5 years ago.
The only reason you're dealing with 6mm is that it's very close to 1/4""; in a metric world you'd be dealing with 5mm (or 1/2 cm) instead, which is a fifth of an inch and thus impossible to imagine if you learned measurements in inches.
Actually, 0.25"" is 6.35 mm. But I get your point. To be fair, I also deal with inches using decimal points and you're right it gets trickier. It does get approximated, we use 3/4"" for 2cm instead of 0.787 inches and 1 1/4 for 3cm instead of 1.181. This is all measuring by hand. On the computer or the machine we'll use decimals accurate to .001. At that point, neither are really easy to visualize. But for physical measuring and approximation, for making things the size we do and for our final level of accuracy, I just prefer using imperial.
Hmm. Back in my ancient history of drafting, we'd call it a railroad pen. Perfect freehand parallel lines.
This, and potentially to make it a little less painful. The more needles, the easier it is to handle, ironically. My guy showed me the difference between 1, 2 and 3 needles when I got my first tattoo done. It was distinct.
Well, British people also use some imperial values, like miles and pounds. I find units of distance and weight to be the most common ones that people still use imperial for, and I can sort of think in inches/feet/yards/miles, but have to convert for pounds. (Divide by 2.2) But it's the units of volume and temperature that I don't really get. I can't think in gallons at all and America really shouldn't be using Fahrenheit considering that the rest of the world uses Celsius. It's not even easy to convert between the two!
I think being in Canada we have our minds messed up. It was only in the start of 1980s I believe that Canada switched from Imperial to Metric. My parents were in school when the system changed. I have better understanding of temperatures in Celsius, while I can visualize weight better in pounds. I can visualize a foot more than 30cm~, but can easily visualize a meter and kilometer over a mile. Strange world we live in, haha

This is coming from someone that grew up with the metric system, I live in Canada, and never learned imperial until around 5 years ago. The only reason you're dealing with 6mm is that it's very close to 1/4""; in a metric world you'd be dealing with 5mm (or 1/2 cm) instead, which is a fifth of an inch and thus impossible to imagine if you learned measurements in inches. Actually, 0.25"" is 6.35 mm. But I get your point. To be fair, I also deal with inches using decimal points and you're right it gets trickier. It does get approximated, we use 3/4"" for 2cm instead of 0.787 inches and 1 1/4 for 3cm instead of 1.181. This is all measuring by hand. On the computer or the machine we'll use decimals accurate to .001. At that point, neither are really easy to visualize. But for physical measuring and approximation, for making things the size we do and for our final level of accuracy, I just prefer using imperial. I write technical documents for a European company that installs precision equipment into American construction projects. Pour one out for me, homie.

Yeah farenheit is just one of those things i can't for the life of me understand. It seems to be arbitrary and based on nothing. The boiling and freezing points of water as a baseline makes far more sense to me. I know what you mean about the pounds thing. I've got friends in countries that use kg for weight and it throws me off. Then again that's unless it comes to food. Food in grams and kg makes more sense to me. Uhhh then there's hmmmm weed, where there's that weird combination of grams, and ounces and such....and for some reason a 2-6 is 750mL(under 26oz) and a 40 is 1.14 L (under 40oz) a 60 for 1.75 L(under 60oz)...but for some reason a mickey and a texas mickey for the smaller and largest size. And liquor's kinda weird. They sell it mL or L in stores, but bars will serve pints or sleeves, but the amounts seem to vary. Some seem to use an american pint, some use a british pint, some just rip you the fuck off. Then again, my girlfriend's from England and they give their weight in stones.....that just...i just can't, that one makes no sense to me.

If you’re drinking liquor by the pint, there’s bigger problems than exactly how many ounces they’re serving you. (A pint is 20 oz in Canada, by law.)
Fair enough...i meant beer when it came to the pints. Yeah. Tell that to the bars.
While I agree in principle, screw and bolt sizes are based on duty. A 6mm bolt is nearly half as strong again as a 5mm one and an awful lot of day to day stuff is secured with 6mm screws and bolts. In my toolbox I keep 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10mm machine screws. It's the 6mm need the most replenishing.

So, in the end, all we apparently know is this two cactus needles are ink stained. No evidence it s a tattoo tool, just an inking/designing/decorating tool. Am I wrong?

You are wrong. The paper is not behind a paywall, so you could just read it. But here’s the important part of the conclusion: Quote: Both artifact tool spines exhibit black staining, which extends approximately 2.08 mm from the tip of the unbroken spine (Fig. 3A; fig. S2, in Supplementary Materials A). The length of pigment staining on the spine tips matches the approximate depth of skin penetration necessary for inserting tattoo pigment beneath the human epidermis (~2 mm), and the extent of use-wear documented in experimental tattooing research (text S4 and table S2, in Supplementary Materials A) (Deter-Wolf and Clark, 2017, p. 237; Gates St-Pierre, 2018, p. 883). Through SEM analysis, we discovered that the pigment on the artifact cactus spine tips is embedded in the spines (fig. S13c–d, in Supplementary Materials A), and that the spines are stripped of barbs, smoothed (Fig. 3B, fig. S14a–b, in Supplementary Materials A), and rounded towards the tips (Fig. 3B; figs. S4g, S7, and S15d, in Supplementary Materials A) as compared to unmodified modern specimens of Opuntia spp. (fig. S4f, in Supplementary Materials A). The rounding of the Turkey Pen tool tips resulted from the spines repeatedly being pushed into skin (Fig. 3; text S3.3, in Supplementary Materials A). The same changes in spine morphology were replicated here through experimental tattooing (text S4, figs. S8–S10 and S15c, e, and table S2, in Supplementary Materials A). The presence of rounding and pigment staining across the surface of the broken spine suggests that the tip broke off during the tattooing process, after which use continued for an unknown duration (Fig. 3B; fig. S7b, in Supplementary Materials A). These results were replicated during experimental tattooing (text S4 and fig. S13b, in Supplementary Materials A). If this break occurred post-deposition, then the staining would not appear on the terminal portion of the break, nor would we expect to see morphological changes such as rounding (fig. S7, in Supplementary Materials A).
True, I was think wood measurements. Choosing a drill bit between 3/8 and 5/16 or 17/32 is the kind of thing where I want to strangle the imperial system.
Yeah but a stone is 14 pounds....why? It's just random and arbitrary.

(Though we personally don't use them, we use kg). Yeah but a stone is 14 pounds....why? It's just random and arbitrary. Well, it is an eighth of a hundredweight, so handy as a measure for certain types of goods. A hundredweight is as heavy a sack as can conveniently be handled, and the contents can then be divided easily. Of course, an imperial hundredweight is one twentieth of an imperial (long) ton which is roughly equivalent to a metric ton, so a hundredweight is 112 pounds, not 100. This standard was only adopted in the 19th century, when measures of weight and volume were linked, with one gallon of water = 10 pounds weight. All that in part as a planned move to decimalisation. The US, of course, by then refused to follow the British lead and did things differently. But if you ever wonder why the UK and those who used imperial measures went metric, these examples should convince you.
Slightly back on topic, I'm very anti-tattoo and would never want one. But the observation about carbon reminds me that many years ago I was removing one of the silencers from a Kawasaki when my hand slipped and the edge of the flange took a neat little flap of skin off one finger. I cleaned it up, put the flap back in place and bandaged it. It healed up perfectly but even today you can see the thin dark line of carbon from the edge of the flange. Plenty of people have tattoos of motorcycles by I guess few have been tattooed involuntarily by a motorcycle.

(Though we personally don't use them, we use kg). Yeah but a stone is 14 pounds....why? It's just random and arbitrary. Of course, because all ancient measures are to a degree arbitrary. The first units based on what were believed to be physical constants were the metre (supposedly 1/4E7 the circumference of the Earth through the poles) and the kilogram. But why 1/4E7? That was an arbitrary decision intended to make the metre close to a French customary unit of the time. And why powers of 10? James Branch Cabell mocks this in one of his books where it is decreed that everything in Poictesme must go in powers of ten forever, for reasons. One important fact to bear in mind is that originally units tended to be standalone. Apothecarys used grains (of millet?). Goldsmiths and grocers used different ounces. Houses were built in rods, land measured in chains, cloth measured in ells. Only when people started to think of standardisation did the idea of interchangeability of units (besides, say, knowing the rate of a Lincolnshire ell to a Somerset ell) become an issue. One wonders if some of the ratios, like the metre to the Earth, were artefacts of standardisation (e.g. whoever weighed in stones found the reference stone was about 14 lb, so that's what was used). The logical arguments for going SI are really unanswerable but, like the issue of whether or not Pluto is a planet, emotion and politics clouds everything.
Medieval brain drain. There is a lesson here in maintaining a solid educational system for the next generation to keep them knowledgeable on how to perform maintenance and upkeep. Societies then and now are a complicated, interconnected network of reliant systems (both in infrastructre and cultural/political constructs to keep them running). If any one portion fails, this can doom the entire system.
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't this posted a few months back. Am I taking crazy pills?!
Wat?
Hey, all of you in Toronto, with your sky-high housing prices and people Thunderdoming for the few Amazon delivery boxes still cheap enough to live in, take note.
Aye, the ruins became a real Angkor around the neck of the Khmer Empire at the end there.
There are a number of historical examples of cities being abandoned over time as economics, trade and other non-violent events occurred. Cities rise for many reasons, such as geographical, (e.g., at a confluence of rivers), economic, (proximity to valuable resources or along a trade route), or even military, (controlling routes of invasion). When any of those reasons change, which apparently occurred at Angkor Wat, the rationale for the city's existence is gone. We think of cities as eternal, and for many of the great cities of the world, that is essentially true. However, this should be a lesson that nothing lasts forever, even a great city. Climate change and rising sea levels will, in the next century, cause places along the seacoast, such as New York, Miami, London and more will provide us with modern examples.
This is why Chicago will become the USA's greatest city in the future (well, we Chicagoans already think it is). Sorry LA, NY, and MIA.
So... the well off moved to the 'burbs and left the poor folks behind in a broken down city. How Detroitesque.
There's also something to be said for the faulty ideology of a social hierarchy of importance when it comes to various occupations and labor. When the results of any one person's labor is inexorably linked to and dependent upon the labors of countless other individuals, *everyone* is of equal importance. Unfortunately, this reality flies in the face of elitism, an ancient social convention that humanity has clung to since, basically, the dawn of civilization. And it has also been at the root of every single collapse of nations and civilizations. Not that we seem to be capable of learning from that mistake.
That's why it's so sad that people think 'those who can't, teach' or that blue collar work is somehow just for people who aren't smart enough to get a 'better' job. Well, wherever you're at, you learned from teachers whether direct or indirect, you you got to where you're going because the blue collar folk laid down a road or built a building for you to work in. Not to mention the water treatment and electricity and everything required for your 'educated' life to be sustained. I get it, some blue collar jobs are dirty and nasty, and being a teacher sometimes isn't far behind, but if you get rid of them, then the entirety of civilization will collapse under its own weight as the garbage piles up.
Actually, from what the article describes, once the elites left it wasn't such a bad spot. No tribute to pay, no crowding, as long as the crops flourished there was plenty to eat. Not so bad.
I have to think we're just one good, sustained plague from losing all the big, dense cities like NY. Even if you brought in people who knew about infrastructure, I feel like these big cities have developed their own unique ecologies.
The article a few months ago (which is conveniently linked from the first paragraph of this one) focused on a presumed cascading breakdown of the canal system, using language that suggested a sudden catastrophic collapse even though it was clear even then that Angkor's decline was drawn out over many decades. It seemed to me at the time that the city was not abandoned because the canal system collapsed, but that the canal system gradually broke down because the city was abandoned, so I'm happy to see that this article takes the same stance.
Dude, if you’re going to make a joke that bad, use a Penh Phnom.
The one a few months back was on the unstable climate and was linked in this article.
What are you trying to say? I assumed that his handle was already a Penh name. A Phnom de plume, you might say.
It's nifty that we can now analyze sediment cores and look at pollen counts to discover changes to a city from 800 years ago. <magnus pyke> ""SCIENCE!"" </magnus pyke>
... and thereafter collapsed into total decline.
Archaeologist from Toronto here. My take on this is that we need to increase taxes on wealthy inhabitants of this city to make it less shitty for everyone else. If they're going to make housing so affordable, let's at least make them pay for some improvements. [also, fuck off sidewalk labs, who don't pay any local taxes yet demand a share of tax revenue before having actually done anything of substance]
instructive.
Crazy timing, I was just there yesterday. My tour guide definitely blamed it on Thai invaders.
Reminds me a little bit of personal experience about 15 [no-- 18. Yikes!] years ago, building out a wireless consumer data network which reached about 1,000 square miles and hence became impossible to maintain without hiring more workers as it was not possible for our two field techs to drive far enough in a day to keep up with installation and maintenance. Mix w/onset of ubiquitous and reasonable cellular data and the outcome was inevitable-- not enough money to hire more people, physically too large to operate. Meanwhile, customers moved on.
No, your not following the money. All those lucrative government grants provide a royal lifestyle for the academics, especially the ones studying climate change and environmental degradation. I saw it on Fox news so it has to be correct. /S There is no shame in being a work-guy (or gal). Mike Rowe's ""Dirty Jobs"" was a breath of fresh air IMHO. The things that make a society work are mostly done by average folk doing the best they can at some, usually, mundane task. We can function quite well without the Kardashians or large numbers of rich folk that inherited their money from Daddy (or Mommy). I must agree with Buffett (paraphrased) ""The main arbiter of your station in life should not be decided by which vagina you come out of""
Replace that with 'Vancouver' and you're closer on note. We have rampant speculation buying of new homes by foreign (Chinese) investors that stay empty dispite government attempts to crack down on it. The bubble is gonna burst spectacularly when it does, but maybe then I'll be able to afford to buy something better then a 60 year old townhouse on leasehold land.
Well, if a decade of foreign occupation, followed by a life of sustenance farming while living in crumbling ruins, leading to a complete abandonment of the community by your grandchildren’s days, are the prices you’re willing to pay for not having to pay taxes, we’ll just have to agree to disagree about the definition of “doing fine.” By the way, the article says nothing about the tax rate of the post-collapse residents, and I strongly doubt this was any sort of a tax haven. Do you actually believe the Ayatthaya Thai invaders brought money from home to pay the locals fair market rates for all the food and supplies consumed during their long stay at Angkor, because they wouldn’t dream of exploiting the occupied population? Or that after the Thai army left, the local boys Doug and Dinsdale Piranha formed a band of young men to protect the village against roving bandits, happily working for free and never beating up villagers who wouldn’t pay them “protection money”? Or that, when the village expelled the greedy Piranha brothers, roving bandits decided to leave it in peace and tax-free prosperity instead of raping, pillaging and enslaving the villagers? If you believe all that, I’ve got a temple in Cambodia to sell you....
While I'm in agreement that important societal work often goes under-rewarded, it's all to easy to miss other good lessons here. First, it's really easy to fall into the trap of building(or buying) something that is more expensive to maintain than you can or want to spend. Second, with any design, there are almost always decisions that set a limit on size or scope that can be very expensive to revise later. If the hypothsis in the article is correct, it seems likely that both factors were in play at Angkor Wat. On the same token, it's not hard to see similar mistakes play out in the modern world.
This is why I think arcologies are a bad idea to bring to life from science fiction. Highly complex, high investment, high infrastructure settlements are brittle and hard to maintain, let alone fix when things go horribly wrong. But we may be forced down that route anyway due to climate change/overpopulation/economic imbalance.
I think something similar may have happened to the Aztecs.
While the reasons for the decline of ancient cities might have been very different (war/famine/plagues) the mechanics of decline follow a similar pattern to those of modern ones like Detroit and other cities in the rust-belt. It basically comes down to a reduction in resources to maintain infrastructure and a feedback-loop which amplifies and speeds up the decline over time.
It probably would never have been abandoned if it was in an ideal location but the water meant that you needed regular maintenance. So it required people to clean weeds and maintain pipes and aqueducts not for themselves but for the city at large. If you don't have someone in charge to pay workers then this type of city will eventually crumble. If it was on a hill that wouldn't have happened. Proving that the +1 agricultural bonus isn't worth the loss of the defensive bonus of the hill.

You see, we already have a fully decayed city: MIA, it's already Missing In Action.
""In the early Middle Ages, nearly one out of every thousand people in the world lived in Angkor, the sprawling capital of the Khmer Empire in present-day Cambodia."" for comparison, today about 1 out of 550 people in the world live in Tokyo metropolitan area.
Rome is an other nice example for the ups and downs of metropolitan areas over time. In ancient times they were up to a million residents. Then in the middle ages the population was down to several thousands and most of the infrastructure of the glorious times was lost. Maybe without being the center of a major religion, it would have been abandoned completely. Today they are back to about three million, so more luck than Angkor or others.
Thanks for this post. I'm always amazed at our forebears' construction skills. Quarrying multi-ton blocks of rock, then transporting them considerable distances, then setting them in place....with just rope, pulleys, and muscles.... Gives me a different perspective on my puny efforts to put a granite boulder in my garden.

So perhaps it started as a tourist site. Evolved into a ritual celebration site, was converted to a ritual sacrifices site, then used as an astronomical/astrological calendar, then was abandoned, then resurrected as a tourist site..... thus the site has come full (stone) circle (aka ""henge"").

I'm imagining stuff lost to history that could have changed the world now - like how Roman concrete could cure underwater, or how much better alloys could be made now if the history behind Damascus steel was known centuries ago...
Perhaps those from the locality of the bluestone quarry died and Stonehenge was the location where they were to be buried that was why their stones were originally transported as a monument or signal as to their origin. Those individuals possibly had been notable personages, and then others of similar buried under the other stones, now the precedent was set?

If you have the time... go to Wales. Go to the north coast and find the few remnants of Wales old stock rain forest (yup, Wales was covered in rain forest up until 1000 or so years ago). Go to the south and go to Tenby or St Davids in the summer and the beaches and sea are simply awesome. Go to the mountains, take beer and food, find a nice cottage in the middle of nowhere and go walking. We walked some very ancient roads following the standing stones to Moel Goedog, an ancient fortification with some amazing views. Wales is awesome! Best flag ever too!

Isotopic analysis of bones from the first phase of Stonehenge suggest that the builders were from more Westerly areas not from Salisbury Plain. The evidence isn't available to pin down a Welsh origin but it's not impossible. It also raises the possibility that the stones were put up in multiple places and not moved in a single journey.

If my recollection is right, Damascus steels have been in use for more than 2000yrs. (or 20 Centuries) in Europe...
That last almost-throwaway line is a whole new interpretation to me: that the bluestones are a sort of neolithic Elgin Marbles, a nabbed glory that wasn't even true to purpose when it was erected at Salisbury. Bloody English. We're the *worst*.
We've got one of the Glastonbury hippy old guard! Why are you disrespecting the ancients with that ""it had to be someone else"" stuff? Neolithic doesn't mean stupid, wedges and ramps and cooperation are easy to come by. And where are the crystal unicorns, eh? Eh?
There are various hints and clues as to why the two areas (Preseli Hills & Bath) would be connected and chosen as sites (both have highly unusual rock formations). The Preseli Hills are well known for stone circles, Celtic druidism and Stonehenge-type structures – partially because these hills have unique rock formations (much like the Giants Causeway in Ireland). The rocks are volcanic and form in pillars (i.e. they form pre-cut Stonehenge pillars), so if you wanted to quarry 3-ton vertical stones it makes a great deal of business sense to lever them out from the Preseli Hills (alternatively chisel them out by hand for a few months…). God knows why/how they quarried them to Somerset though.. The connection with Bath/Stonehenge is a more complicated story, but probably based in religion, healing and burial. Bath is historically known as a spa town with 50°C natural geothermal springs, considered of great mystery and religious importance in early Celtic ages. Around this time, Celtic religions worshipped Bath as the location of ‘Sulis’, a healing and life-giving goddess, and people will do peculiar things to honour their dead. You can look at similar mystical and tourist trends at the modern spas and geysers in Bath/Iceland to imagine what might draw people in from hundreds of miles away. There are some less documented histories that might be nonsense, but there are references to King Bladud/Blaiddyd – an alleged founder of Bath from the time period when the main stone circle was built, a Celtic king who was cured of disease after washing in the 50°C spa, these suggested that various diseases could be cured by washing the body, in an era where personal hygiene was poor (not a million miles away from current thinking). Due to the dominant chalk soil Stonehenge would have been a naturally flat and open field – so perhaps suitable for campsites, burials and dwellings between forests. That’s probably the basics, plus a whole heap of odd traditions and religious factors thrown in from the Celtics/Romans.
It would have been much easier, instead of dragging them on rollers that distance by land, to have taken these stones from the quarry to the nearest stream, dammed the stream in stages and floated them downstream to the sea on a raft, then taken them around the coast by sea transport and floated them upstream to the nearest river access at the Stonehenge construction site.
They sort of did. It is thought that they floated them across the severn estuary.
Volcanic ash and quicklime in the Roman concrete in combination with seawater cause tobermorite and phillipsite crystals to appear through the mix.
I was listening to Stonehenge and that solo came on just as I scrolled to your picture!
I think the biggest things that changed the world was not just knowing how to things, but also knowing why things work the way they do, and then being able to do them on a large scale. Damascus steel is ancient, but there wasn't the understanding of why certain steels were so good, or the ability to control formulations and heat treatment to get those results all the time. Crucible steel also doesn't lend itself to large scale mass production which had to wait for things like the Bessemer Converter. Good steel is one thing, but until it can be made consistently and cheaply, it's not going to change the world.
The neolithic builders of the early phases of Stonehenge were replaced by the the Beaker people around 2000BC. The entire population was replaced within a few hundred years. There is no evidence of neolithic activity in Bath. The narrow tidal river valley regularly would have flooded and the heavy clay soils on the steep valley sides were not farmable until the iron plough arrived around 700BC. The British Isles between roughly 2000BC and 700BC was part of the Atlantic Bronze age. The degree of Celticness of the inhabitants during that period is a matter of some rather heated debate. However what is normally understood as Celtic culture, which has the technical name of La Tene, didn't arrive in the British Isles until 700BC. No Druid would have set foot in Stonehenge until 1700 years after the last building phase.

I love Spinal Tap as much as the next Arsian, but for those with a more serious interest in megalith builders, there's a rather wonderful new paper in PNAS which suggests that things started in Brittany and then spread by maritime diffusion: https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eur ... gin-france “European megaliths were products of mobile, long-distance sea travelers,” [author] Schulz Paulsson says.

interesting article, but i saw nothing indicating where the museum is located. edit: Lisa Niziolek is associated with field museum of chicago, hog butcher to the world.
I just love the archaeology articles. Especially if the science behind the discoveries gets some love. Most mainstream articles just give the results with no explanation as to how we know what we know. Thanks.
The funny thing is that knockoffs and fakes were a huge thing all over the world. There was a booming trade in religious artifacts like Saint bones and ""pieces of the cross"" often sold in a clear vial one wore as a necklace. Pieces of the ""robe"" were equally valuable. Fakes were abundant and people would pay out a lot of gold and silver for them, believing them to be the real thing. It's really no surprise that this was a thing in places outside of the European sphere of influence. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but it seems to me that if it transcends culture, it's probably human nature driving it to want the same something for yourself that other people have.
Along those lines, I wonder if it could have been a scheme like ""1000 clay pots for sale, only the finest -- feel free to inspect this first box we opened for you the other 999 are just like it, trust us""
That's why a valuable antique chinese base is almost always a scam, even if it's hundred of years old, is probably a knock off.
Rest assured that 900 years from now, ceramic toilet bowls, urinals and washbasins will be among the most numerous artifacts recovered from our civilization.
Cheap knockoffs? From China? My word, I would have never expected that. /s
To be fair, the expensive originals are also from China.
Great, in addition to knockoff antiques, now I have to worry about antique knockoffs!
To quote some wag who badly quoted Erasmus, ""there are enough pieces of the True Cross to forest a hill in Lebanon.""
This is off topic and only vaguely related, but I had to use a portable XRF ""gun"" a long time ago as part of an old career. I was inspecting a building (a golf clubhouse, of all things) at the same time the Secret Service was scanning the place for potential security risks (apparently the President at the time was a big fan of said golf course) and my XRF set off their detectors.... It's a real fun time when you have a lot of unhappy men pointing guns at you demanding you drop the (250k$ at the time) gun you are holding. We got it straightened out, and the clubhouse manager, who had made as scheduling goof arranging the SS and me to be in the same place at the same time, gave me a year's free pass to golf because of this. ...shame I didn't golf...

As these seem to be everyday consumer goods in this article, are these knock-offs or value priced generics. I consider this a function of representation, branding, markings, and consumer knowledge. In other words were these sold as the 'Great Value' brand, or is it like when Wustof sells inferior Chinese stamped blades under their name (licensing and selling out), or true counterfeit merchandise (e.g. a Suny WalkMan, ghost shift Wiimotes, etc.). These differences have a significant meaning in the present day as well from the perspective of current IP and Western perceptions of goods produced in Southeast Asia. A clearer understanding of the historical context would help to understand if this is one of those, ""it's always been that way"" situations or just standard evolution of consumers and producers. I don't mind the obvious generic at a substantially reduced price depending on my needs. That's not what I consider a knock-off. Counterfeits and consumer hostile licensing / manufacturing agreements which dilute built consumer brand value on the other hand are offensive knock-offs.
A ship in the 12th century could carry 200 tons of iron? That’s a big ship.
XRF.... that brings back memories. We had one of those things in the 3rd-year undergrad labs. It wasn't a fancy automated handheld gun; it was built from discrete components on a bench, and you had to figure out how to set up and calibrate it. The thing's multichannel analyzer would dump raw text files of intensity vs. photon energy onto a floppy disk, which you'd then compare against a massive book of reference spectra so that you could figure out how to do the peak-finding, etc. algorithms to determine what it was pointed at. Those kinds of experiments produce a LOT of respect for the difficulties involved in going from ""we understand the physics"" to ""we can make this into something that is practical to use"". I'm always a little fascinated by research that shows just how much trade and travel happened in ancient societies. There was a real ""West is Best"" mentality in our elementary and high-school history classes, with anything prior to the start of European colonization, or that didn't involve European dominance over Europe (and, later, North America), being mostly ignored. Among British sailing circles, almost nobody believed the ancient Polynesians could have developed a sophisticated seafaring civilization with significant trade among their far-flung islands.... until a Brit (James Wharram) crossed the Atlantic in a boat based on a millennium-old Polynesian design. We have so much still to learn!
I would be curious to know who the end customers were, and what they looked for in ceramics. That's not as easy to find out from artifacts. Where there is any sort of sustained trade, however, both the sellers and the customers eventually get to know what quality of goods are available at different prices, and what they want to buy.
There is absolutely no shame in not golfing....
I wonder if anyone's cornered the market on knockoff antique knockoffs yet....
IIRC, they were mostly shallow water boats that hugged the coastline. But due to market pressures they had to brave the see at some points, risking disaster for the chance of a big payout. But we still get a lot of them ending up on the bottom of the sea.
Genuine faux antique knockoffs?
And if they become collectible enough, you'll have to worry about knockoff antique knockoffs. Edit: ninja'd by adespoton.
Hmm, were the antiques really knockoffs, or just products made in a similar style? For them to be knockoffs (or counterfeits) I would expect them to have markings to indicate a false origin. Without such markings, it seems likely that they're just downmarket products. I'm looking at the coffee mug that's on my desk right now and I wouldn't call it a knockoff just because it looks similar to nicer coffee mugs...

Ask the Dutch if there is a market for Chinese ceramics knock-offs.
Of course sometimes the fakes start to be valuable: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/masterpiec ... eal-money/
It sure is. If I did the math correctly, that's about 30 cubic yards of iron. The Chinese could build wooden ships a few hundred feet long that themselves weighed hundreds of tons by the time this one sank. Not only could it carry all that iron, it also had 100,000 ceramic pieces on it. I imagine the loading and unloading process was an exercise in organizaed chaos. I wonder if 200 tons of iron was a typical load, or if maybe this ship's captain bit off more than he could chew and overloaded his vessel, causing it to sink.
I guess it depends on how you define knockoff. I was watching a program on experimental archaeology regarding and a Viking (IIRC) sword maker Ulfbert. The swords were superior to any others of the era and had a special logo inlayed in steel. Competitors would sometimes try (and fail) to mimic the inlay. The blacksmith (modern) had quite a challenge to recreate the techniques and weaponry of the famed swordmaker. Honda first cars were knockoffs of the mini-cooper.
Indeed. I would like to know why these archaeologists are calling the products knockoffs. At least for watches, handbags, etc., the distinction is whether or not the products are trying to be passed off as something else. If you make a watch that looks the same as a Rolex and it says ""Rolex"" on the dial then it's a knockoff/counterfeit and it's usually illegal to manufacture and knowingly sell or purchase. If you make a watch that looks the same as a Rolex but it says ""Steinhart"" on the dial, then it's an ""homage"" and not illegal. Looking at the Honda N600 vs. the original Mini, they look pretty similar but there are a bunch of notable differences. Calling the N600 a knockoff would be sort of like calling a Honda Accord a knockoff of the Toyota Camry just because they have many similar dimensions and characteristics...
According to this article (p.11) by the Field Museum, the ship was about 28 meters (92 feet) long, and laden with 230 tons of cargo. To quote, ""Overloading, coupled with turbulent seas, might have contributed to the ship’s sinking."" Last edited by Fearknot on Mon Feb 11, 2019 3:22 pm
The funny thing is, as an early example of forgery, the antique knockoffs could be more historically interesting, and thus more valuable, than the originals. It might very well be more lucrative to create knockoff antique knockoffs than knockoff genuine antiques!

The typical case is that the item is both of an inferior quality, and has a point of origin other than the quality item it resembles. As far as Chinese fakes go, the knock-offs either lack the markings of the authentic item, or else they are present, but extremely distorted. (In the case of one Japanese manufacturer of fake Chinese artifacts, the stroke order of the glyphs is wrong.)
Our local art museum had an exhibit a few years ago of art forgeries. Some of them were comparable in value to the originals they copied, thanks to their quality and age. Perhaps it's time to start selling forgeries of forgeries...
To me ""knockoff"" is a term where the maker is trying to gain value by copying or imitating a high value product. Toyota camry and honda accord are more like convergent evolution. Knockoffs lack creative authenticity.
I have to take issue with that because it it completely and utterly wrong. Honda's first cars were a Kei-car pickup truck and a tiny but very advanced sports car, the S500, from 1963. It had a 4 cylinder DOHC motorcycle engine and rear chain drive. The Mini-cooper of the same era had a longstroke version of the original 848cc Mini engine, a pushrod, FWD transverse layout. Anybody comparing them would realise that the Honda was technically many years ahead of the Mini. In fact, Honda were more or less invited in to help fix the UK car industry. Honda more or less wiped out the British motorcycle industry by making products that were more advanced and simply better in nearly every way, so even mentioning Honda in the context of knockoffs is a gross error. (The only Hondas I own are the engines in my generator and rotavator, this isn't a fanboy rant.)
So Aliexpress is a lot older than we thought
Also related are engineering targets/benchmarks. For example, the Nissan 240Z aimed to provide similar specifications and performance as a Porsche 911 of that era but at half the price. But that doesn't make it a knockoff...
""Inferior quality"" + ""different point of origin"" describes most products ever made. (Since only one version of any given thing can have the best quality.) But that doesn't mean that most products are knockoffs. And what if one company makes a thing, and another company comes along and makes the same sort of thing but with higher quality. Does that mean the original thing becomes a knockoff of the subsequent thing?
I was going from an old friends (ironically a Honda enthsuiast) anecdote. So you may be correct.
They were not everyday consumer goods, Chinese porcelain was a status item. Song dynasty ceramics are argued by many as the best ceramics there ever has been. The highest quality was reserved for imperial use and was often used as a diplomatic gift. A brush washer dish of Song dynasty Ru ware went for $28 million. It was Qingbai ware which was found in the shipwreck and at the time that would have had the worth of high end Mercedes. Today, genuine Qingbai, will cost around $3 million a pop.
Maybe they aren't ""everyday consumer goods"" (depending on your definition) but 100,000 ceramic vessels could be sold to a lot of consumers...

This week on Trading Spaces 500BC...
Celts, always playing Head Games.
That is why Christianity made such an impact on that world. Christians showed those around them that there is another way, and the commandment to “love one another” had societal impact.
And then along came the Norsemen... In much of the ancient world (that we know about) not allowing the bodies of your defeated enemies to be buried or cremated was considered pretty shitty behaviour. Achilles is a pretty obvious psychopath and Homer's sympathy is with Hector. But indeed, what we know of the pre-Christian Celts suggests an artistic but rather horrible society. The Tain Bo Cuailnge is a huge moral step backwards from the Iliad, which dates from at least 1700 years earlier. The question is what social development might have taken place without Christianity? After all, the Catholic Church was pretty much traditional Roman religion 2.0, and at that point Buddhism had been spreading for nearly 800 years.
The Romans themselves were not above the display of severed heads. During Sulla's proscriptions, the heads of his enemies were left in a pile in the Forum.
Embalmed heads on display. Just to change the subject, my dentist has some diplomas, awards, licences on display behind glass in his office.

Aren't there terpinoids in cannabis?
True enough. I remember in college one of our professors actually stated that the most impactful aspect of the Roman empire conversion to Christianity was this very societal impact. Amongst many problems facing the declining Roman empire, the newly concerted citizenry valued the empire and war differently than those before them (i.e. the fealty to the church, a sin based afterlife, and at least on the surface adherence to ""love one another"" versus the sword, made them weak).
The riddle of steel....the Celts in Britain and Ireland did not have iron, they used copper and tin, when the invaders came with their iron knives and swords, the game changed. The history of man I heard said is the history of war. The religions teach peace but self defense and warfare is still a driving force of change for mankind. The warrior king, philosopher king, god king, driving the force of evolution since the beginning of time. The riddle of steel is what made armies of swords and hand weapons the rulers of the age. Interesting how carbon is still a factor today but not in swords but in so called climate change, but that is for another debate master Conan. The age of swords may one day return again. Live long and prosper.
The Vandals, Goths and other groups were Christian as well, so the argument of weakness due to Christianity is pretty weak.

The Bronze age started in the British isles with the arrival of the Beaker people in 2000 BC. This is before the arrival of any group that could be described as Celtic. The British Isles was part of the Atlantic bronze age, some historians argue that during this period a Celtic speaking people arrived in the British Isles. La Tene culture which is the technical name for what is normally is called Celtic culture, arrived in the British Isles in about 700BC, with iron technology.
Indeed, some of the most militaristic societies in the world today are the most ""Christian"". Like the US...
Did he win those awards from their previous holders through mortal combat?
It was a commandment oft-ignored. Early Christians often used violence against members of competing religious groups and the path to Christian dominance in many areas of the world was achieved with fire and the sword. After Constantine I made Christianity the state religion in an effort to unite the Roman Empire under a common religion, it wasn't long before Christians began persecuting Pagans. E.g., Theodosius I (347 - 395 CE) persecuted Pagans as did Christian emperors of the Byzantine empire. Charlemagne gave Christianity its dominance in Europe. He did so by force. E.g., in 782 CE he issued the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae, which stipulated that ""If any one of the race of the Saxons hereafter concealed among them shall have wished to hide himself unbaptized, and shall have scorned to come to baptism and shall have wished to remain a pagan, let him be punished by death."" The year 782 CE was the year he massacred an estimated 4,500 Pagan Saxons in the Massacre of Verden during the Saxon Wars. The Norwegian kings Olaf Tryggvason (960s - 1000 CE) and Olaf II Haraldsson (995 - 1030 CE) used violence to Christianize the populace as did Inge the Elder (1105 - 1110 CE), a king of Sweden, as noted by Rodney Stark in How the West Won. In Europe, Catholic forces also carried out the Northern Crusades. And of course, there was a lot of later internecine warfare among Christians over religious differences, e.g. the European wars of religion from the 16th through the 17th centuries. In the New World, the Spanish, and other European countries, frequently resorted to force to Christianize the native peoples. The 1680 Pueblo Revolt occurred as a result of the Spanish imprisoning 47 Pueblo leaders, three of whom they hanged, for practicing ""sorcery,"" i.e., for refusing to abandon their own religion. Forced conversions occurred in many other areas of the world as well. African conversions were often achieved by force. And in India there was the Goa Inquistion from 1560 - 1820 CE. Christianity's place among the dominant religions of today was achieved in large measure by the penchant of believers to use harsh measures to suppress rival religious groups. The New Commandment was quite frequently forgotten when dealing with those ""others."" If putting the severed heads of enemies on public display seems barbaric to some, the public burning of those deemed heretics or unbelievers was once a common practice in medieval Europe and beheadings and public display of one's opponents bodies or pieces thereof occurred in Christian lands, e.g, as one example the Münster tragedy, many centuries after the heads were severed from the bodies of those whose fate is discussed in this article.

I did some archaeology courses in undergrad (medieval historian, figured it was a good call) and it was a running joke that 'when in doubt, just call it a ritual object'. It's not even a malicious thing, since ritual can be such a catch all term. If an alien species came in and saw us with our tech without understanding what we're doing with it, there's no doubt they'd see it as a ritual form of behavior. It puts the onus on the observer that what is being seen can't be fully explained due to lack of data, but that its use was important enough to exist. Not as satisfying an answer as clearly understanding its use, but I sort of think that's the fun of looking at the past. They led complex lives, and we only see the glimpses that persisted in the material record. It's pretty neato.

We all have!” LoL I'm having difficulties understanding why these archaeologists could not tell the difference between a 3,500- to 4,500-year-old stone circle and a stone circle created in the 1990's before they announced their ancient Celt 3,500- to 4,500-year-old stone circle. Is there no peer review or testing or examination beyond 'this guy said' in the archaeology field beyond 'we suspect'? Did you miss the part where they continued to research it, and found little to substantiate claims of an ancient site? Quote: And even before the replica-building farmer came forward, the team had started to question the age of the stone circle. Under closer scrutiny, some details just didn’t look quite right. Sometimes it helps to read the WHOLE article.
Stones are old, so dating the stones themselves is useless. Surface weathering would tell you something, but if the replica was built from stones that had been sitting on the surface a long time themselves then that also gets you nothing. I assume that an excavation would have revealed the more recent soil disturbance but one wasn't done for the reasons explained in the article. So they dated it based on the style being consistent with other circles where more thorough investigations were done to produce the estimated dates. I don't blame them for not initially suspecting a fake. What's the motivation? It's not like anyone stood to make a lot of money off of it, and it was reported by a *former* landowner. Everyone involved seemed to be acting in good faith, it was made from ancient, weathered stones in a typical arrangement and 20+ years is plenty of enough time to destroy any surface evidence of recent work.
Science is a process, not an end goal. Fantastic science can be behind both successes and failures. It is the process that has the value, not simply the answer that comes out at the end.
There is no RIGHT and WRONG in science only varying levels of supporting evidence or discarded hypotheses. Science finds truth with a small T and it is generally a tentative truth which holds until some compelling counter evidence disrupts the contention.
Next you'll tell me the Kensington Runestone wasn't left by Vikings in Minnesota in 1362 and was carved as a prank by a farmer in 1898. (it was)
Which, coincidentally, is why I base my outlook on Science rather than religion.
Read the article.
It's obvious he didn't read *any* of the article. He has an agenda and jumped. And ends up looking like the fool he is.
Overheard in a car nearby: ""Come on, MacScully, this is definitely a cover up by government agencies hiding something from the public. Why can't you see that?""

Once again, the process works. ""We were wrong, our bad, no animals were hurt in the process."" The evidence didn't support the initial hypothesis. Happens *all the time* in science. That's how it works. We all get to chuckle and move on.
You'd be surprised. Even this last summer there were cases in Britain of drought causing grass shadows of old building foundations and garden paths that had been gone for well over a hundred years. The water system at Angkor Wat shows up very clearly on radar and lidar mapping satellites, as do old Aztec cities and roads.
It IS an ancient stone circle. I mean, it's a young ancient stone circle but one day it'll grow up to be a truly old ancient circle.
From henceforth we will call it Trainspotting Henge.
Which reminds me. Google Earth and Maps undated a lot of their UK aerial images in about July last summer. Round my way in Essex/Suffolk details of things only known to the oldies in the village or that I know from old maps have become visible. Tres cool.
Well, to be technical the *stones* *are* ancient. The circle not so much.
We've done it we have found the fountain of youth!!....Ummm no. That is just an old well near where a house used to be.
The farmer just didn't want to be unhinged....

I'm half convinced that a good number of what gets classified as ""fertility objects"" were actually the equivalent of porn.

So then, using your explanation: Its ok for 'scientist' to announce something to the world that is not true and they should have known it not to be true if they had done complete solid research, but because they can come back later and say ""whoopsie, made a mistake so lets laugh about it"" then the blunder of not actually doing solid research to begin with is OK because we can say the 'point' is something else? That's not science, its incompetence. Your ignorance slip is showing in full view. Scientists do ''announce to the world' hypotheses that ultimately turn out to be 'wrong'. That's how it works. Scientific journals are filled with 'announcements' (study results) that on further examination turn out to be 'wrong'. By your logic, that's 'bad science'. No, it's how science works.

Even if we brush twice daily and floss like our dentists insist? I guess it depends on whether you expire shortly after a brush and flossing or after a hefty meal that sticks to your teeth.
Wonderful story. I wonder if some of that woman's beautiful illuminations were among those lost in the fire? What a tragic thought.
Wow, those are some amazingly good teeth. There are no molars and no evidence of them. I wonder if they fell out relatively early which would have left plenty of room for the remaining teeth to settle in so straight.
Caries wasn't at all common at that time, although it tends to affect molars more than other teeth. Once refined sugar became commonplace, followed by tobacco smoking, dental quality in Europe plummeted.
It doesn't even have to be refined. Archaeology on Henderson Isle showed a population of Polynesians had inhabited the island for a period of time and their teeth were riddled with caries, likely from sugar cane consumption.
Even in the middle ages monks were not supposed to use women......
Well, she also seems to have lived a life without physically hard work.
It's not like scribes are usually known for themselves even if they were male. So not particularly surprised that the ranks of the anonymous scribe contained both monks and nuns. Given how valuable/important such manuscripts were, I suspect they used whoever had talent. Probably one of the better jobs you could have in a monastery/abbey too.
One of the reasons why confession boxes were introduced was becasue the supplicant used to be on their knees in front of the confessor with predictable ""penances"" awarded. The period of Papal rule in Rome in the 10th century is know as the pronocracy for a reason.
Not necessarily; she may have been a laywoman, or she may have technically belonged to a nearby convent but worked at Dalheim. This kind of specialist skillset would have been in demand. And that thing you did? ""Just to be contrary?"" Don't do that.
There's nothing wrong with the contrary view, because often that stops us from jumping to conclusions. Without knowing more about scribing that could be a legitimate explanation; however, I would guess that the historians who did the research would be the ones to ask about that and they seem to believe that she was responsible for doing the writing herself. In any field of research, looking at multiple options is effective. (Just to be clear, I'm not saying we should ""Teach the controversy"" here, because that phrase is linked to known phenomenon that have no actual scientific controversy, only a political one.)
The equivalent term is a nunnery. An Abbey is a religious fraternity headed by an Abbot (m) or an Abbess (f). There may be smaller satellite communities under an Abbey known as a Priory. A monastery or nunnery may also be a priory or an abbey, since the gender of the community (monks or nuns) are what determine what it can be called.
If there's a genuinely insightful, reasonable alternative interpretation that someone seems to have missed, then by all means, advance it! But Ragnarredbeard was just coming up with a contrary explanation for the sake of being contrary, and no. And that was, pretty self-evidently, not a legitimate and reasonable alternative explanation.
She must have eaten soft food. If future antiquarians discover my jaw in years to come, they'll know that in my youth, I opened beer-bottles with my teeth.
Point of pedantry: there are other places that mine Lapis lazuli, chief among them Chile in South America (of course, not relevant during the timeframe of the story). There's also some deposits in Russia and Africa.
This is correct, although there you missed out the word Convent, which as far as I'm aware is basically an alternative term for Nunnery.

But it's unlikely that monks would keep her around to do only that job, and not also assign her maid-type chores, which would have shown up in her bones.
At this date a non noble layperson would be extremely unlikely to able to write. The vast majority of the knightly classes would not have been able to read and write during this period. Its not until you get to the 14th century, with the employment of chantry priests to teach literacy to local children, that a layperson could possibly write.

A layperson is just anything but an monk, nun, priest, or other member of the ordained clergy. It implies nothing about their social position, as by definition most nobles were of the laity just as much as any rando peasant. The point was she didn't necessarily need to be a member of the Dalheim abbey to work there, because she apparently was so skilled they trusted her with the paint they had to drag all the way back to Christendom from what is now Afghanistan. That's the kind of skill you make an exception for. And various sources ssuggest that the people painting the illuminations - which it seems likely this woman was, given again that she was using the super-expensive blue pigments - were not necessarily the same people laying down the calligraphy. It's possible that she could have indeed been illiterate and unable to write the text, yet capable of the embellishments and illuminations. Last edited by Snark218 on Wed Jan 09, 2019 3:51 pm
Archaeology ultimately rests on the interpretation of whats found. The results are more on the balance of probability than a scientific result. Bronze age Germany is far more open to interpretation than high medieval Germany, because written accounts do exist of the time. So you have a reasonable idea of how people lived during the time frame in question. So on the balance of probability, the woman was scribe. However archaeologists are people, so current issues do tend to creep into interpretations of the past, and you get reports written on the extreme end of possibilities rather than considered positions.

It's possible that she could have indeed been illiterate and unable to write the text, yet capable of the embellishments and illuminations. It is possible. But thinking back conceptually to the 12th century, and the whole medieval world, you have the concept of ora et labora - work and prayer. Illuminated gospels were sacred objects. Monasteries jealously guarded their techniques, only allowing members of the same Rule to learn from them. It's a peculiarly 21st century outsourcing idea to imagine that she wouldn't be a nun because that would be the tie that bound her to the convent. The deal you got with being a nun was, basically, no babies in exchange for a life of not too hard work at something you were good at, whether it was plainchant, embroidery, tapestry, or manuscripts. It was an attractive prospect for some of the nobility of the era who were too far down the pecking order, or too plain, to take place in the game of mates and mating.
All things considered, it probably wasn't a bad gig and the trade-off worth it. Times were tough in them days especially for women.

I was more admiring how straight they were.
My thinking, though, was that this was an abbey, not a convent - so for even a nun to have an important role there was something of a testament to just how skilled she was,feel me?
If you want a full detailed history then read a history book, there are 1000s of them. I am not going to write 1000 words on simple comment.

Kind of the archeological equivalent of always wearing clean underwear in case you're hit by a bus.
That's the problem with people these days. Everyone complains about the weather, but no one wants to sacrifice a child to change it.
Man is there ever something deeply screwed up about humanity. I'm just grateful that the dominant religion now has settled for metaphorically eating people and drinking their blood.
That's not what capitalism does. Religion of ever increasing profit is much more efficient at murdering than Aztecs or any other groups from the past.
Is not doing anything about climate change essentially sacrificing our children...
How many legs did this fearsome god have, exactly?
Minimum of three I would guess.
People who lived in a dark, dangerous, scary world saw the world through a lens which was in many respects dark and scary. I don't think it says all that much about the human condition in some sort of cosmic philosophical sense. I do think it's interesting to consider what these religious beliefs would have eventually evolved into, had the local culture industrialized and eventually grown food-secure. I don't think it's outlandish to suggest that a person who has lived a soft, comfortable life like ours might be a little less open to the idea of human sacrifice to guarantee the next harvest.
I am certain one day anti-vaxxers will be equally remembered as primitive people.
Somewhere in the world, there's Bloodseeker trying to satiate the Flayed Twins.
Would be nice to fast forward 2000 years into the future, and see which of our “normal” beliefs and practices today horrify future generations. But Even in their worst week, am pretty sure human sacrifice took a much less toll than is taken by, say, opiod overdose’ today. Last edited by whatdouwant on Mon Jan 07, 2019 12:49 pm
We seem pretty open to the idea of bombing the fuck out of people to guarantee the next barrel of oil, so I'm not sure enlightenment is so complete.
Interesting metaphor. My perception and understanding has me thinking about the symbolic meaning behind Xipe Totec's skin. Often, metaphysical writings talk about how there is the spiritual layer at the core; then the physical layer. How the physical layer is a superficial layer for the sake of our physical realm, being of relativity. Xipe Totec taking off his skin, emerging from his skin - his true self emerging, shedding the superficial layers in order to feed humanity. Humanity would reside solely in this realm, or layer of existence. It makes for an interesting statement, how humanity needs more of the physical sustenance to maintain and thrive; while that skin decays in the eyes of Xipe Totec.
Unless it means pieces of each leg.
I think you'll find that 37+ different priests (i.e. drug lords) and their staff are keeping these practices alive and well in Mexico.
Sacrifice, human or not, has been a long standing attempt to petition perceived agency for favor. In a universe where many seemingly inexplicable things occur, assigning agency to various aspects of the unknown has a long history. Once agency has been assigned it is just a small step to attempting to influence the agent. Nowadays the sacrifices are things like Lent or Ramadan, or petitioning via ""thoughts and prayers"". Humanity's sacrificial systems have decreased in number and bloodiness as a better understanding of the natural world has progressed. But we are far from completely abandoning the concept.
Every culture/religion I can think of has some sort of re-birth ritual related to agriculture. It's no coincidence Christian Easter is in the spring, to overlap with pagan rituals of spring rebirth. I'm not sure why the word ""macabre"" was used here, almost as if this was somehow more disturbing or unusual than any other ancient ritual.
But if you shoot them first (with semi-automatic weapons, presumably), then it's all OK.
Where are the witty GoT metaphors?
Probably the human sacrifice that's still going on in parts of the world today
True, but they will sacrifice a child to keep it the same. The Central/South American Pre-Columbian civilizations have always fascinated me in a horrified sort of way. They thrived for hundreds of years, yet seemed to be amazingly indifferent to, if not actively hostile toward, human life. I can see why European cultures found them to be ""evil"" since such practices were beyond the pale (which considering the lengths to which the Inquisition went is saying something!). But how they managed to sustain themselves, let alone thrive with that mindset is something I've never really managed to wrap my head around. I think I can understand how these practices came about (some kind of interpretation of nature around them, for the most part), but the whys of it (why human flesh for so much of this?) are what I don't get. Honestly, I'm not sure I'd want to, either.
Let's be fair, rebirth from a rotten corpse is a bit weirder than rebirth after being crucified and then sealed in a cave. And as far as I recall, no blood and gore was involved in the Buddism version (i.e. Siddhartha).
What the skull carving represents is weird, but I still find it interesting to look at.
Macabre and disturbing are subjective; they necessarily come from the perspective of the speaker/writer. Personally, I agree with the characterization, based not on the rebirth aspect but the murder and rot aspects. I suspect the stress on those aspects is, in fact, also more ""unusual"" but that one is more open for fact-based discussion if e.g. you want to cite examples of the role of rot and decay in the context of rebirth ceremonies. If you don't think ""macabre"" or ""disturbing"" can be applied simply because it is a different cultural context, you are in essence denying that either word offers any communicative value. I disagree.
I kind of want to have one in my living room. ""What's that?"" ""Oh, that's just Xipe Totec. Appease him by wearing the skins of your enemies.""
It's hard to grasp the vast scale of the human sacrifice in Mesoamerica. We've found mountains (okay, hills) of skulls. At the peak of the Aztecs in Mexico it was estimated that they were sacrificing about 250,000 people a year (in total, not at any single location), which is about 1% of the estimated population. Of course the strategy was to mostly sacrifice prisoners from other countries, but you also had your own criminals, people who lost at ullamaliztli (the handball game), and others. When they reconsecrated the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, they sacrificed between 10,000 and 80,000 people over 4 days depending on who you believe. The priests would run a multi-altar slaughter line. Prisoners would shuffle along in a line to the top, where you had four altars running full bore. Then the bodies would be tossed over the side to keep things moving - some of them would be ritually flayed, and some of them would be eaten. In 2017 our total drug deaths in the US were about 70,000 (which is way up from 2016 thanks to fentanyl) for a population over 10x larger than the Aztec population. It takes some time to come to grips with just how freaking much the Aztecs loved human sacrifice.
Perhps they were inspired by the House of Bolton.....
His legs may be missing, but his testicles are intact. Priorities.
The picture shows 2 legs, both broken in middle of the thighs.
The Spanish were terrible, but what the hell are you talking about? ""About as technologically advanced"" aside from having things like, oh I don't know, metal tools? I assume most of the rest of what you've written is equally detached from reality.
each about 3 meters (9.8 feet) wide and 78 to 88cm (2.5 to 2.8 feet) high i assume this suggests they used the metric system.

I assume most of the rest of what you've written is equally detached from reality. Um they had metal tools/weapons of copper. There wasn't any Iron or tin largely because it wasn't needed. They had ample access to Obsidian and Chert which are actually better for cutting. Their math, science and medicine was also more advanced that the Europeans. While the Europeans were bloodletting they were using tinctures, salves, and medicines made from natural herbs to treat and cure the same issues. They actually had working sanitation and funerary practices which prevented crap like plagues from occurring. Read a history book. Some suggestions: 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus The History of Latin America: Collision of Cultures A People's History of the United States Ancient Civilizations of the Americas All of these are highly regarded by historians regarding their accuracy and detail. The ignorance on Ars sometimes is startling. Weren't they mostly wiped out by the plagues the Europeans brought over? Sanitation only helps so much. The 1000 years of peace thing seems suspect too given all of the evidence of tribal warfare throughout the region.
1491 is one of my favorite works of nonfiction. What this user is claiming is eyes-in-the-stars lunacy, totally unsupported (in many cases outright contradicted) by at least one of the references he claims to cite. ""They didn't have iron because they didn't need it"", I mean, how can a person type that with a straight face? I would be embarrassed for myself for saying such silly things.
This may be a cultural misunderstanding. If you have never known anything different, where's the comparison? MacAulay in one of his books suggests that to extract a Persian satrap, show him our society and return him would be no kindness. He would now know that arbitrary imprisonment and death are not universal. But so what? He's still embedded in it. Another example is the courts that grow up around dictators. Stalin was pretty horrendous. Hitler actually treated his own courtiers fairly well till he went totally paranoid.
Off-topic, sorry. Just opened my Febrary 2019 Astronomy magazine, and there is a great article by Kiona there about researchers trying to see how life could work in a hydrocarbon environment (such as Saturn's moon Titan). Good read, but not sure if website is paywalled.

You can't really build working firearms with copper and copper is too soft for any blade that's longer than a couple inches. mltdwn wrote: They had ample access to Obsidian and Chert which are actually better for cutting. They are, for the first couple cuts. Obsidian has very little durability and flakes off. That's why surgeons don't use obsidian blades, if some of it gets into the cut it's a mess to clean up. mltdwn wrote: Their math, science and medicine was also more advanced that the Europeans.

Europeans weren't bloodletting by the middle of the renaissance. Better sanitation I might give but that's mostly a factor of low population density than anything related to technological development. London during the industrial revolution was filthy not because people didn't want to be clean, but because people hadn't figured out how to pack that many people into a small amount of land and stay clean.
